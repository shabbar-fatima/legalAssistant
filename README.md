# ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Legal-AI Assistant for Pakistan  
**Document Summarization, Precedent Retrieval & Decision Suggestion using RAG**

This repository contains the code and data for a legal assistant system designed specifically for the Pakistani legal domain. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to assist in legal research, case summarization, and AI-guided recommendations â€” helping lawyers, students, and analysts work more efficiently with local case law.

## Features

-  **Legal Document Summarization**  
  Extracts and condenses lengthy case files into readable summaries, highlighting key facts, decisions, and legal issues.

-  **Precedent Retrieval**  
  Uses embedding-based semantic search (e.g.ChromaDB) to find relevant Pakistani precedents based on a case description or query.

-  **Decision Suggestion**  
  Generates legally grounded suggestions and interpretations using an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 turbo), conditioned on retrieved case law.
  
## Conclusion
Following these steps, you should have a working environment with Python, Streamlit, and Redis integrated. This setup will allow you to run applications that utilize Redis for memory management efficiently.
