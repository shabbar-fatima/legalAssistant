ORDER  
Qazi Faez Isa, CJ . 
 
Civil Misc. Application No. 6336/2023 : Civil Review Petition No. 272/2022 
(‘the CRP ’) filed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2627/2019 (‘ CPLA ’) 
was dismissed for non -prosecution on 27 April 2023. Through the instant 
application the order dismissing the CRP is sought to be recalled on the 
ground that the petitioner’s counsel was indisposed; the application 
attaches a document issued by a doctor which states, ‘ Not V alid for Court’. 
When a document states it is not valid for court , reliance thereon cannot be 
placed. However, in the interest of justice, the application for restoration of 
CRP is granted and the CRP is restored to its original number/position, and 
we proceeded to hear it.  
 
Civil Review Petition No. 272/2022 : The CPLA was dismissed on 25 May 
2022 and three concurrent decisions were upheld.  
 Civil Misc. Application No. 6336 of 2023 etc.

2. A power -of-attorney was executed in favour of Fayaz Ahmed Khan by 
his sister, namely, Mst. Siraj Bibi (the respondents are her legal heirs), 
which was used to purportedly sell 109 kanals of land to his four sons, 
namely, Muhammad Mumtaz Khan, Ghulam Abbas Khan, Ghulam Shabbir 
Khan and Ghulam Ali Khan. The power -of-attorney did not specifically 
authorize the sale of the land in favour of the attorney or his sons, and 
Fayaz Ahmed Khan ha d misused it. Therefore, the principal (Mst. Siraj Bibi) 
could repudiate the said transaction as stipulated in section 215 of the 
Contract Act, 1872. Mst. Siraj Bibi repudiated the sale transactions and 
filed a suit for declaration and cancellation. The su it was decreed and the 
decision of the Trial Court was upheld throughout. Without getting the 
benefit of the decisions Mst. Siraj Bibi passed away, having remained 
deprived of her 106 kanals  of land. Her legal heirs (the respondents herein) 
now represent h er. 
 
3. The conduct of the attorney, Fayaz Ahmed Khan, and his four sons, 
the purported buyers, was deplorable. A sister and aunt was illegally 
deprived of her land. It often happens that vulnerable members of society 
are exploited and deprived of their pr operties by such dubious methods, 
and then they spend a lifetime to regain what is rightfully theirs. Mst. Siraj 
Bibi was entangled in a web of perpetual litigation, and, even though all the 
decisions were in her favour, she remained deprived of the land a nd its 
produce throughout her lifetime. The petitioners and their predecessor 
violated Article 24(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his property save in 
accordance with law . The  conduct of Fayaz Ahmed Khan and his sons was 
reprehensible.  
 
4. The purported sale/transfer of Mst. Siraj Bibi’s land was effected in 
derogation of section 42 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, and of the 
judgments of this Court which stipulate that extra car e must be exercised 
with regard to the property of women. In this regard reference may be made 
to Muhammad Rafiq v  Mst. Ghulam Zoharan Mai ,1 Tahsinullah v Mst. 
Parveen,2 Mst. Parveen LRs v Muhammad Pervaiz,3 Ghulam Qasim v Mst. 
Razia Begum,4 Atta Muhammad v Mst. Munir Sultan,5 Farhan Aslam v Mst.

Nuzba Shaheen,6 Mirza Abid Baig v Zahi d Sabir7 and Muhammad Naeem 
Khan v Muqadas Khan .8  It was observed in Mst. Parveen v Muhammad 
Pervaiz  that: 
‘We are dismayed to observe the all too frequent prac tice 
in Pakistan of male heirs resorting to fraud and other 
tactics to deprive female heirs from their inheritance. 
While this deprivation causes suffering to those deprived, 
it also unnecessarily taxes the judicial system of the 
country, resulting in a ne edless waste of resources. Each 
and every day that a male heir deprives a female heir is 
also an abomination because it contravenes what has 
been ordained by Almighty Allah.’  
 
5. The revenue officers/officials were either complicit in recording the 
illegal  mutations or were incompetent. The department should weed out 
such officers/officials from within their ranks as they undermine the 
credibility of the record of rights, and as a consequence destroy lives too. 
The Government of Punjab would be well advised  to initiate action against 
those who were involved in the said sale mutations, which could only have 
been done with their collusion or through incompetence.  
 
6. Therefore, whilst dismissing this CRP the petitioners are directed to 
immediately hand over th e possession of the subject land to the 
respondents, and if they do not do so the concerned revenue authorities 
should immediately dispossess the petitioners therefrom. The petitioners 
benefitted from illegally retaining the said land. Section 216 of the C ontract 
Act, 1872 stipulates that the principal (Mst. Siraj Bibi) is entitled to the 
benefit derived from transactions illegally made. But, this claim was not put 
forward, and, therefore, not considered. In the facts and circumstances of 
the case and on ac count of the petitioners’ most unreasonable conduct we 
direct them to pay to the respondents one million rupees as costs . Till 
payment is made such amount shall constitute a charge on the landholding 
of the petitioners.  
 
7. Copy of this order be sent to th e concerned revenue authorities of the 
area where the said land is situated, to the Senior Member Board of 
Revenue, Punjab and to the Revenue Department of the Government of the
