For the petitioners:  Mr. Atif Ali Khan, Addl.A.G KPK.  
(in all cases)  Malik Akhtar Awan, Addl.AG KPK  
 
Respondents:  N.R.

ORDER  
 
  Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - These review petitions 
have been filed against the consolidated order dated 14.11.2019 
passed by this Court, whereby the civil appeals filed by the 
Government of KPK through District Collector, Mardan wer e 
dismissed. The solitary contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners in these petitions is that section 28 of Land Acquisition 
Act, 1894 ( “Act” ) as amended by the North -West Frontier Province 
Land Acquisition (Amendment) Ordinance 2001, does not  provide 
for payment of 6% interest on the enhanced compensation to the 
landowner from the date of taking possession of the land till the 
date of payment, yet the same has been granted by the Referee 
Court and the High Court and maintained by this Court in the order 
under review. It is further contended that the amended section 28 of 
the Act simply provides for the payment of the enhanced 
compensation to the landowners without any interest  irrespective of 
the date of possession and the actual date of paymen t of 
compensation to the landowner.   
 
2.  We have considered the contention of the learned 
counsel for the petitioners.  Section 28 of the Act, as amended by 
the North -West Frontier Province Land Acquisition (Amendment) 
Ordinance, 2001 (XVII of 2001) provi des as follows: - CRP No.758/2019 etc  8 
 
28. lf the sum which, in the opinion of the Court, the 
Collector ought to have awarded as compensation is in 
excess of the sum which the Collector did award as 
compensation, the award of the Court may direct that the 
Collector shall deposi t with the Court such amount  as 
determined by it. (emphasis supplied)  
Before we examine the meaning and scope of the aforementioned 
amended section 28 , it is important to trace the genealogy of section 
28 from its inception in the year 1894. History of sec tion 28 of the 
Act, across Pakistan, shows that interest has been an integral part 
of the enhanced compensation which is paid to the landowner to 
cover for the period between the actual taking over of the possession 
of the land and the actual date of payme nt to the landowner . The 
said interest has originally been 6%, which was increased to 8% 
compound interest in 1969 , as shown below: - 
 
Land Acquisition Act, 1894  
28. Collector may be directed to pay interest  on excess 
compensation  : If the sum which, in the  opinion of the 
Court, the Collector ought to have awarded as compensation 
is in excess of the sum with the Collector did award as 
compensation; the award of the Court may direct that the 
Collector shall pay interest on such excess at the rate of 
six per c entum per annum from the date on which he 
took possession of the land to the date  of payment of 
such excess into Court.

In section 28, for the words "pay simple interest on such 
excess at the rate of six per centum per  annum from the date 
on which he took possession of the land to the date of 
payment of such excess into Court",  the words "deposit with 
the Court such amount as determined by it " were 
substituted .       
Reading of the above provisions shows that interest i s to be paid for 
the period from the date of the taking over of the possession of the 
land till the date of the payment of the enhanced compensation  and 
this is the position prevalent all over Pakistan . In this background, 
we examine the amended section 28  which reads that once the 
“sum” of compensation granted by the collector is enhanced by the 
court, the court shall direct the Collector to deposit such “amount” 
(as opposed to the enhanced “sum”) as determined by it. The 
amendment has retained the power o f the Referee Court to 
determine the “amount ” payable by the Collector to the landowner  
over and above the enhanced sum of compensation after CRP No.758/2019 etc  10 
 
considering the factum of possession and the date of actual 
payment . If it were just the enhanced sum of the award  which had 
to be paid  to the landowner , the phrase “amount as determined by 
it” would have no significance.  Section 28 envisages that after the 
enhanced sum of the award has been worked out, the Court  then 
embarks upon determin ing the “amount” to be paid t o the 
landowner  after considering the sum and the delay in payment . This 
determination has to be of the period that has passed by after the 
possession of the land of the landowner was taken over and of the 
interest over and above the enhanced sum of the co mpensation to 
be paid to the landowner who has been deprived of this amount of 
compensation since then. Our reading of the amended section 28  in 
KPK shows that the court is now free to award any rate of interest 
on the enhanced sum of compensation and is not bound by the limit 
of 6% . It does not mean that the court is not to grant any interest on 
the sum enhanced. The argument of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that the enhanced sum of compensation by the court, 
even though paid to the landlord sever al years after taking over of 
the possession of the land, will still be the same sum and will carry 
no interest because the amendment takes away the term 6% 
interest, appears to us to be not only fanciful but also hopelessly 
misconceived. The distinction b etween the terms sum and amount 
to be determined  is that while the “sum” is simply the enhanced 
compensation, the “amount” is the interest over and above the 
enhanced compensation to provide for the loss caused to the 
landowner due to the delay in making p ayment of the adequate 
compensation since the taking over of the possession of the land. 
This construction of section 28 (KPK amendment) blends with the 
prevalent law in other provinces in Pakistan and is true to the spirit 
of the original law and is also constitutionally compliant with Article 
24 of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973.  
3.  Another dimension of the case  which reinforces the 
concept of interest is under  section 34 of the Act (which was not 
amended by the 2001 Ordinance in KPK) , which  deals wit h the 
payment of interest on the sum of compensation awarded by the 
Collector. Section 34 states as follows:  CRP No.758/2019 etc  11 
 
34. When the amount of such compensation is not paid or 
deposited on or before -taking possession of the land, the 
Collector shall pay the amount aw arded with simple interest 
thereon at the rate of six per centum  from the time of so 
taking possession until it shall have been so paid or 
deposited.  
Under the said provision, the Collector is to pay simple interest at 
the rate of 6% on the amount of the c ompensation for the delay in 
the payment of compensation from the date of taking over of the 
possession of the land till the date of payment. This provision is still 
intact in KPK. So, while interest is provided for on the compensation 
awarded by the Colle ctor, the same cannot be denied when the 
compensation is enhanced by the court. Sections 28 and 34 have to 
complement each other and, therefore, section 28 also provides for 
interest but unlike other provinces, KPK has no statutory limit on 
the interest to  be granted by court.  
  
4.  For the above reasons we hold that section 28 of the 
Act, as it exists in the Province of KPK, authorizes the Court  to 
determine the amount of compensation to be paid to a land owner, 
which is over and above the enhanced sum of compensation 
awarded by the Court . This determination of the amount includes 
the interest on the enhanced sum of the compensation for the 
period when the possession of the land was taken till the payment of 
the enhanced sum of the compensation to the land owner. Under 
the amended section 28, the court is no more bound by any fixed 
rate of interest and can grant interest at any just, proper and 
reasonable rate as it determines, which could also be the rate 
determined by the State Bank of Pakistan.  Therefore , the award of 
6% interest is well within the scope of the powers of the Referee 
Court under section 28 of the Act (as amended) and is in line with 
the interest to be granted under section 34 of the Act.  
 
5.  For the above reasons, we find no merit in the se review 
petition s, which are therefore dismissed.
