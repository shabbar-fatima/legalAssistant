 IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ. - We have 
heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and have 
examined the pleadings/documents placed before us for 
ascertaining as to whether transaction between the parties i.e. the 
Lease for 20 -years in respect of Lakhra Power Station GENCO -
IV, dated 11.09.2006, followed by Power Purchase Agreement 
dated 15.12.2007 had been entered into in a transparent m anner 
following the PEPRA Rules  and allowing open opportunity to 
interested parties to participate in the competition for acquiring 
the said Leasehold R ights .  
2. The conclu sion is that the transaction noted herein above 
between M/s. Associated Group (AG) and the Water and Power 
Development Authority (WAPDA) is not sustainabl e being  non-
transparent  and also suffers from  irregularities, illegalitie s, 
omissions and commissions as well as violates the relevant  Rules  
 CAs.149/2010, etc.  3 
as well as precedents set -forth by the superior Courts . 
3. Therefore, while setting aside the transaction noted herein 
above , we direct the Federal Government of Pakistan to conduct 
an inquiry/probe to fix the civil and criminal liability upon the 
persons/beneficiaries, etc in accordance with the law as a result of 
above conclusion.  
4. For the reasons to be recorded later, both the appeals are 
allowed with costs throughout.
