that the Parliamentarians having dual citizenship may be declared to 
be disqualified in terms of Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution read with 
section 14 of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951.  
2.  The matter was taken up on various dates, during course 
whereof notices were issued to the following Parliamentarians allegedly 
having dual citiz enship:  -   
1. Mr. A. Rehman Malik, Senator  
2. Mr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Senator  
3. Mr. Sabir Ali Baloch, Senator  
4. Ch. Zahid Iqbal, MNA

(Sr.No.1), Ch. Zahid Iqbal, MNA  (Sr.No.4), Ms. Farah Naz Isfahani, 
MNA (Sr.No.6) and Mr. Jamil Ahmad Malik, MNA  (Sr.No.10)  entered 
appearance through their counsel and contested the matter . The 
Parliame ntarians at serial No s.1, 6 and 10 were admittedly holders of 
dual citizenship, however, the Parliamentarian at serial No. 4 against 
whom sufficient material was placed on record,  could not substantiate 
that he was not in possession of dual ci tizenship.   
4.  This Court suspended the membership of some of the 
Parliament arians detail of which is mentioned hereinbelow: - 
 Sr.No. Name  Date  
1. Ms. Farah Naz Isfahani, MNA  25.05.2012  
2. A. Rehman Malik, Senator  04.06.2012  
3. Dr. Ahmad Ali  Shah , MPA  13.06.2012

9. Ms. Nadia Gabol, MPA  04.07.2012  
 
5.  M/s Muhammad Ashraf Chohan and Ch. Nadeem Khadim 
MPAs, after service prayed for adjournment  by sending applications , 
which were  allowed vide order of even date , but subsequently they did 
not deny the fact um of having dual citizenship.  
6.  On the other ha nd, vide orders dated 13.06.2012 & 
4.7.2012 proceedings against the persons at serial No.2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 
and 13 were dropped as no material was produced against them  to 
show they possessed dual citizenship . Mr. Tariq Asad , ASC  through 
CMA No. 2487 of 2012  claimed that Sardar Shahjehan  Yousaf, MNA  
was the holder of dual citizenship , but when the latter contested the 
application through his counsel, the former  withdrew his application Constitution Petition No.05/2012  4 
and also tender ed apology for leveling unsubstantiated  allegation, 
therefore , no further proceedings are called for against Sardar 
Shahjehan  Yousaf, MNA . 
7.   It is to be noted that Mr. A.  Rehman Malik vide letter  dated 
19.4.2012 stated  that he ha d renounced his citizenship of UK on 
25.03.2008.  Contents of the letter are reproduce d herein below:  -

 Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi    Petitioner  
     Vs. 
 The Federal Government through Secretary Law and others  
        Respondents  
 
Please refer to your letter No.1(3)/2012 -AGP dated 31st March 2012, 
concerning the above cited Constitutional Petition.   
 
In this regard, it may be informed that by virtue of my continuous 
exile in UK f or nine years due to political victimization and life threats 
in Pakistan, which is a matter of public record, I was granted British 
nationality but I never renounced my Pakistani citizenship as dual 
nationality is allowed under the Pakistani law. However,  I renounced 
my British nationality on 25.03.2008 before I held public office. I thus 
do not hold any other citizenship including of British nationality except 
that of Pakistani citizenship.  
 
Yours sincerely

(Senator A. Rehman Malik)  
   
8.   It is not eworthy that a long with the above letter , no re-
enunciation form issued by the U K Border Agency was filed  in terms of 
section 12(1) of the British Nationality Act, 1981 to substantiate the 
aforesaid claim . However, copy of letter dated 29 .05.2012 issued by  Constitution Petition No.05/2012  5 
UK Border Agency was placed on record  subsequently . The same  is 
reproduced herein below:  -

Dear Mr. Malik  
 
Renun ciation of British Citizenship  
 
I am writing to inform you are now registered as having renounced 
British Citizenship.  
 
Enclosed is the Declaration of renunciation bearing a stamp of 
registration. This confirms the date on which you ceased to be a British  
Citizen under Section 12(1) of the British Nationality Act, 1981.  
 
Yours sincerely,

9.   Plea on his behalf was that he had applied to re nounce  his 
British citizenship on 25 .04.2008  before contesting the election of 
Senate of Pakistan , but the UK Border Agency did not issue certificate 
of renunciation of citizenship and subsequently when this matter came 
up before th e Court , the S olicitor in UK  namely, PHI (Legal) confirmed 
that he had renounced his British citizen ship through his application 
dated 25 .04.2008. Alongwith letter, copies  of the a pplication form and  
cheque of HSBC dated 25 .04.2008  in the name of Accounting Officer, 
Home Office, issued by Dr. Saeed Rehman w ere also annexed.  
Whereas according to British Nationality Act, 1981, when a person files 
application form, declaring that he wish es to renounce  his British 
citizenship or other British status, UK Border Agency returns the copy 
of application form officially signed and sta mped, together with the 
documents filed with it . Despite repeated directions and opportunities 
granted to him, Mr. A. Rehman Malik chose not to file these papers in Constitution Petition No.05/2012  6 
Court . This aspect of the case,  however, shall be discussed in the 
detail ed order.  
10.  Prima facie, it is apparent  that Mr. A. Rehman Malik  
renounced his citizenship after the instit ution of the listed petition, as 
is evident from the contents of the letter dated 29.05. 2012 wherein he 
was informed that he was “… now registered as having renounc ed 
British Citizenship ”. In ad dition to it declaration of re nunciation bearing 
stamp of registration was also enclosed in terms of legal provision 
noted therein. But, s urprisingly the copies of this declaration were not 
placed on record despite the fact th at the Court repeatedly directed  for 
filing of the same. His membership as a Senator was  suspended  on 
04.06.2012 , therefore, on account of this reason he could not continue 
as the Interior Minister of the Government of Pakistan. However, he 
was appointed a s Advisor to the Prime Minister.  
11.   It appears that to overcome  the disqualification , he 
tendered resignation from the seat of Senate, which was accepted vide 
notification dated 11. 07.2012 and against the vacant seat he 
participated in the fresh electi ons and was declared successful 
candidate vide notifi cation dated 24.07.2012. In the meanwhile , he 
filed CMA No.3467/12 stating therein the following reason to resign 
from the membership of the Senate and to re-contest the election: - 
“That serious allegati ons were leveled by the opposition 
and carried by various media that laws were being 
amended for him, therefore, in order to dispel any such 
perception and in larger interest of democracy the 
applicant resigned as Member of the Senate of Pakistan 
under his  signature on 9th July, 2012. The Senate has 
issued a notification of acceptance of resignation on 11th 
July, 2012 . The same are placed on record.”  
   
Be that as it may, from the above fact s it is established that having 
renounced the citizenship and upon  issuance of letter dated 
29.05.2012 by the Home Office, UK Border Agency , he was satisfied Constitution Petition No.05/2012  7 
that disqualification proved against him st ood removed, therefore, he 
should occupy his seat in the Senate free from any disqualification. In 
this behalf, it is to b e noted that knowing well that his British 
Nationality /citizenship  did not stand  renounced, he made a false 
statement before the Court and the petitioner filed petitions  for 
initiating proceedings for contempt of Court  against him , which shall 
be considere d separately later on.  
12.   The petitioner who appeared in person prayed  to declare 
all the respondent  Senators, MNAs or MPA s to be disqualified as they 
were holding tho se offices contrary to the provisions of Article 63(1)(c) 
of the Constitution. For co nvenience same is reproduced hereinbelow: - 
“63(1)  A person shall be disqualified from being 
elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the 
Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament), if -  
(a)  … 
(b)  …. 
(c) he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the 
citizenship of a foreign State ”   
 
13.   Mr. Waheed Anjum, ASC has appeared as interven or and 
submitted a list of elected representatives , including those who 
admittedly were not disqualified as they had no dual citizenship, as 
such proceedings against the m were dropped, detail of which has been 
mentioned  hereinabove. It is important to note that in respect of Mr. 
Tariq Mehmood Alloana, MPA from Punjab , the matter was seriously 
conte sted by Mr. Alloana , but Mr. Waheed Anjum, ASC stu ck to his 
stance . But later on, it was found that on the bas is of false information 
supplied by the FIA, he was seeking his disqualification for  being an 
MPA and when the matter was further probed and information was 
collected from FIA, it transpired that attempt was being made to  get 
him disqualif ied with ulterior motives . As such directions were given to Constitution Petition No.05/2012  8 
the Additional Registrar  of this Court  to lodge a criminal complaint 
against the concerned officers of FIA who had supplied incorrect 
information. Accordingly, o n the application  of Additional Registrar, 
Supreme Court, the case was registered on 04.07.2012.  Proceedings 
against Mr. Alloana were , therefore,  dropped.    
14.   Learned Attorney General appeared on Cour t notice in 
terms of Order XXVIIA CPC and did not support  the co ntent ions of 
either the petitioner or of the interven ors.  
15.  It has been emphasized by Mr. Waseem Sajjad, Sr. ASC 
appearing for Ms. Farah Naz Isfahani and learned Attorney General 
that under Article 63(1)(c)  of the Constitution , the phrases, namely , 
“… … ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan ”, or “acquires the citizenship of 
a foreign State ” are to be read conjunctively and not disjunctiv ely and 
the word ‘o r’ appearing in between those phrases is to be read as ‘and’ 
because in such a situation, according to them , the Members of 
Senate, National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies having dual 
citizenship could continue in their offices without suffering from any 
such disqualification.   
16.  After hearing the petitioner, learned Attorney General, 
learned counsel for the respondents and others , taking into 
consideration the relevant provisions of the Cons titution reproduced 
hereinabove and the material available on record, we are persuaded to 
hold th at if a candidate suffers from pre or post disqualification under 
Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution , no sooner such disqualification as 
envisaged under the said Article  is attracted, becomes and is 
disqualified from bei ng elected or chosen , and from being a Member of 
the Malis-e-Shoora  (Parliament). These provisions hav e to be 
construed strictly by interpreting the same in view of the established  Constitution Petition No.05/2012  9 
principle of interpretation by assigning plain and simple meanings to 
the words and phrases used therein and  avoid ing any substitution  
there of as the same is not within the ambi t of this Court.  
17.  It is to be noted that a candidate , while filing nomination 
papers signs a declaration on oath to the following effect:  -  
“DECLRATION AND OATH BY THE PERSON NOMINATED  
 
1. I, the above mentioned candidate, hereby declare on 
oath that, —  
(i) I have consented to the above nomination and 
that I fulfill the qualifications specified in Article 62 of 
the Constitution and I am not subject to any of the 
disqualifications specified in Article 63 of the 
Constitution or any other law for the time being in 
force for being elected as a member of the National 
Assembly/Provincial Assembly.  
 
18.    The above declaration is applicable to the candidate s of 
membership of Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, therefore, 
whoever signs such a declaration is  meant to be  fully aware of the 
constitutional provision s and after signing the said declaration  if the 
same turns out to  be false, he  makes himself liable to be disqualified 
from being elected or chosen as Member of the Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament) or a Provincial Assembl y for making misstatement or 
concealment of fact, and also exposes himself to criminal proceedings 
contemplat ed under section s 193, 196, 197, 198 and 199 PPC.  
 19.  In view of the constitutional pr ovisions under Article 
63(1)(c) & (p) of t he Constitution read with section 99(1)(f) of the 
Representati on of the People Act, 1976 it is to be seen as to whether 
their cases are to be dealt with by the Speaker /Chairman  under Article  
63(2) or by the Election Commission under Article 63(3) or are to  be 
de-notified by the Election Commission after having been declared to Constitution Petition No.05/2012  10 
be disqualified from being a member of Majlis -e-Shoora  or Provincial 
Assemblies. This Court has earlier deal t with this matter in the case of 
Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani in Constitution  Petition No. 40 of 2012, etc. 
He was convicted by a 7 -Member Bench vide judgment dated 
26.04.2012 for contempt of Court under Article 204(2) of the 
Constitution read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 
2003 and sentenced under section 5 of t he said Ordinance and the 
reference filed by one Maulvi Iqbal Haider before the Speaker of 
Assembly to declare him disqualified under Article  63(2) was answered 
in the negative . Thereafter, the ruling of the Speaker was challenged 
before this Court through  Constitution  Petition s which were allowed 
and w hile dealing with  the similar issue, the Court vide judgment 
dated 19.06.2012 held as under:  -   
“As a Bench of 7 Hon’ble Judges vide judgment dated 
26.04.2012 followed by the detailed reasons released on 
08.05.2012 has found Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani guilty of 
contempt of Court under Article 204(2) of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read with section 
3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and sentenced 
him to undergo imprisonment  till rising of the Court under 
section 5 of the said Ordinance, and since no appeal was 
filed against this judgment, the conviction has attained 
finality. Therefore, Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani has become 
disqualified from being a Member of the Majlis -e-Shoora 
(Parliament) in terms of Article 63(1)(g) of the 
Constitution on and from the date and time of 
pronouncement of the judgment of this Court dated 
26.04.2012 with all consequences, i.e. he has also ceased 
to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan with effect f rom the 
said date and the office of the Prime Minister shall be 
deemed to be vacant accordingly;      
The Election Commission of Pakistan is required to issue 
notification of disqualification of Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani Constitution Petition No.05/2012  11 
from being a member of the Ma jlis-e-Shoora w.e.f. 
26.4.2012 .”  
 
20.  Thus, for the reasons to be recorded later, we declare 
that:- 
(a) Ch. Zahid Iqbal, MNA, Ms. Farah Naz Isfahani, MNA, Mr. 
Farhat Mehmood Khan, MNA, Mr. Jamil Ahmad Malik, MNA, 
Mr. Muhammad Akhlaq, MPA( Punjab), Dr. Muhammad 
Ashraf Chohan, MPA  (Punjab ), Ms. Nadia Gabol, MPA  
(Sindh) , Ch. Waseem Qadir, MPA  (Punjab ), Ch. Nadeem 
Khadim, MPA (Punjab) , Ms. Amna Buttar, MPA  (Punjab) , Dr. 
Ahmad Ali Shah, MPA  (Sindh)  have been found disqualified 
from being members of Majlis -e-Shoora (Par liament) and 
Provincial Assemblies because of their disqualification 
under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution.  
 
(b) The Parliamentarians/Members of Provincial  Assemblies , 
who have been declared to be disqualified, in view of the 
established  fact that they have acquired the citizenship  of 
Foreign States, therefore, no question has arisen , which is  
to be determined by the Chairman/Speaker. Thus, no 
reference under Article 63(2) is being made.   
 
(c) The Election Commission is directed to de -notify the 
respec tive memberships of Parliament/Assemblies of 
aforesaid persons.  
 
(d) All the Members of the Parliament/Provincial Assemblies 
noted above had made  false declarations before the 
Election Commission while filing their nomination papers  
and as such appear to be guilty of corrupt practice in terms Constitution Petition No.05/2012  12 
of Section 78 of Representation of Peoples Act, 1976 , 
therefore, the Election Commission is directed to institute 
legal proceedings against them under section 82 of the Act 
read with sections 193, 196, 197, 198 and 19 9 PPC in 
accordance with law .  
 
(e) The members of Parliament/Provincial Assemblies noted 
hereinabove, being disqualified persons are directed to 
refund all mon etary benefits drawn by them  for the period 
during which they occupied the public office  and had drawn 
their emoluments etc. from the public exchequer including 
monthly remunerations, TA/DA, facilities of 
accommodation along with other perks which shall be 
calculated in terms of money by the Secretar ies of the 
Senate, National Assembly and Provincial  Assemblies 
accordingly.   
 
(f) The amount, so recovered from all of them by respective 
Secretaries shall be deposited in the public exchequer 
within a period of two weeks and compliance report shall 
be sent to the Registrar.   
 
(g) As regards the case of  Senator A. Rehman Malik, it may be 
noted that at the time of filing of nomination papers for 
election to the Senate  held in the year  2008, he had made 
a false declaration to the effect that he was not subject to 
any of the disqualifications specified in Article 63 of the 
Constitution  or any other law for the time being in force for 
being elected as a member of the Parliament /Provincial 
Assembly, therefore, r eference will be required to be made Constitution Petition No.05/2012  13 
to the Chairman  Senate  under Article 63(2) in view of the 
provisio n of section 99(1)(f) of the Act  of 1976 , which lays 
down that a person shall not be qualified from being 
elected or chosen as a member of an Assembly unless he 
is sagacious, righteous and non -profligate and honest and 
ameen . Mr. A. Rahman Malik, in view o f the false 
declaration filed by him at the time of contesting the 
election to the Senate  held in the year 2008 , wherein he 
was elected , cannot be considered sagacious, righteous, 
honest and ameen within the contemplation of section 
99(1)(f) of the Act of 1976. Therefore, for such purposes 
Article 63(p) is to be adhered to because th e 
disqualification incurred by him is envisaged under th e law, 
referred to hereinabove in view of his own statement that 
he ha d renounced his citizenship of UK whereas the fact 
remains that such renunciation along with declaration can 
only be seen as having been  made on 29 .05.2012.   
 
(h) Senator A. Rehman Malik  is directed to refund all mon etary 
benefits drawn by him  upto 11.7.2012  for the period 
during which he occupied the publ ic office in the same 
manner as directed in the case of other Parliamentarians  
noted above .  
 
(i) As Mr. A. Rehman Malik had made false declarations while 
filing his nomination papers before the Election 
Commission  in the election held in the year  2008, 
therefore, the Election Commission is directed to institute Constitution Petition No.05/2012  14 
legal proceedings against him as it has been directed in 
the case of above said parliamentarians .  
21.   The Election Commission of Pakistan is also directed to 
examine the cases of the Parliament arians and the members of 
Provincial Assemblies , individually,  by obtaining fresh declaration on 
oath from all of them that they are not disqualified under  Article 
63(1)(c) of the Constitution.  
22.  The titled Constitution Petition is disposed of in the abo ve 
terms. However, the Criminal Original Petitions are adjourned to a 
date in office.
