JUDGMENT  
 
Qazi Faez Isa, J . Forty out of these forty -one appeals involve the 
interpretation of section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 (‘ the Act ’). 
There are four sets of impugned judgments in t he said forty 
appeals , which have been  rendered by four different Divisional 
Benches of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi.  Civil Appeal No. 
565/2011 assails the judgment dated 12  November 2010  passed 
by a Division Bench of the High Court comprising of Muhammad 
Athar Saeed and Munib Akhtar , JJ. Civil Appeals No. 772 to 
780/2012  assail the judgment dated 4 June 2011 passed by a 
Division Bench of the High Court comprising of Muhammad Athar 
Saeed and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ . Civil Appeal s No. 768  to 
772/2014 ass ail the order  dated 29 November 2013 passed by a 
Division Bench of the High Court comprising of Syed Hasan Azhar 
Rizvi and Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar, JJ . Civil Appeal No. 132 to 
156/2017 assails the judgment dated 21 September 2016 passed 
by a Division Bench  of the High Court comprising of Munib Akhtar 
and Abdul Maalik Gaddi, JJ.  
 C. A. No. 565/2011, etc.  4
2. Civil Appeal No. 1070/2015 assails the judgment dated 24 
July 2015 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court 
comprising of Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and Muhammad Junaid 
Ghaffar, JJ . However, in this one appeal the question is different, 
and it arises out of a different leave granting order (mentioned 
below in paragraph 8).  
 
3. At the time of the enactment of t he Act in 1969 its section 81 
was titled Provisional assessment of duty1 which was substituted in 
2005 by Provisional determination of liability .2 Section 81 has 
undergone a number of changes from time to time, however, to the 
extent of these cases it has in substance remained the same. 
Imported goods are assessed to duty when the  bill of entry, later 
changed to goods declaration, is filed under section 80 of the Act. If 
however imported goods could not immediately be assessed to duty  
they would be provisionally assessed /reassessed  by the concerned 
officer of Customs and within the stipulated period finally 
assessed /reassessed. If within the stipulated period the goods 
could not be assessed/ reassessed the Collector of Customs was 
empowered in exceptional circumstances  to extend  the period for 
final assessment/ determination.  
 
4. The imported goods, their respective dates of import and the 
goods declarations are different in each of the forty appeals, but 
these details are not relevant for deciding these appeals. S ection 81 
of the Act has also undergone a number of amendments with 
regard to the period within which final assessment/determination 
was to be made and so too the period within which the Collector of 
Customs could exten d such period . However, what is relevant, and 
common to all the said forty appeals, is that the 
assessment/de termination was not done within the prescribed 
period  or the Collector had extend ed the period as a matter of 
course without considering whether there were exceptional 
                                       
1 Customs Act, 1969, Gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary, 8 March 1969 and 
PLD 1970 Central Statutes, pp. 84 -166. 
2 Finance Act, 2005, section 3(25), Gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary, P art-I, 1 
July 2005 and PTD 2005 Statutes 877, pp. 887 -888. C. A. No. 565/2011, etc.  5
circumstances  justifying it , though in some cases the legal 
prerequisites of section 81  were also not complied with.  
 
5. The law enables the Collector to extend the period ‘ in 
circumstances of exceptional nature .’ Leave to appeal in the forty 
appeals was granted by this Court3 to consider whether the 
Collector of Customs w as justified to extend the period within 
which the final determination of liability or assessment of duty 
could be made.  
 
6. The same (above noted) question came up for consideration 
in Collector of Customs, Lahore v S. Fazal Ilahi and Sons4 and in 
that case it was held, that : 
‘7. Subsection (4) of section 81 of the Act provides 
that if the final assessment is not completed within the 
period specified therein, then the provisional 
assessment shall become final. The same has been 
provided as a safeguard to the benefit of the 
assessee/importer/exporter to save them from 
unnecessary harassment by Customs authorities by 
unnecessarily delaying their cases for an indefinite 
period on the pretext of, making a final assessment. ’ 
 
The aforesaid observation/ interpretation by this Court h as been 
the consistent view of the High Courts too. In the case of Collector 
of Customs v Auto Mobile Corporation of Pakistan5 a Division Bench 
of the High Court of Sindh6 had correctly noted the scope and 
object of section 81, as under:  
‘Subsection (2) to  section 81 of the Act of 1969 
provides the period during which such provisional 
assessment is to be finalized by the Assessing 
Authority while the proviso to subsection (2) empowers 
the Collector of Customs to extend the period of final 
                                       
3 Leave granting order dated 7 July 2011 passed in Civil Petition for Leave to 
Appeal No. 64 -K/2011, on the basis of which leave was granted in the said forty 
appeals.  
4 2015 SCMR 1488, p. 1493 B.  
5 2005 PTD 2116, p. 2121.  
6 Ibid., Anwer Zaheer Jamali and S. Zawwar Hussain Jaffery, JJ.  C. A. No. 565/2011, etc.  6
assessment up to 9 0 days under circumstances of 
exceptional  nature after recording such 
circumstances. Subsection (3) to section 81 provides 
that on completion of assessment, the concerned 
Assessing Officer shall order that the amount already 
paid or guaranteed be adjusted against the amount 
payable on the basis of final assessment and the 
difference between the two amounts, if any, shall be 
paid forthwith to or by importer or exporter as the case 
may be. Further, subsection (4) to section 81 provides 
that if the final asses sment is not completed within the 
specified given under subsection (2) to section 81 then 
provisional assessment shall become final. In other 
words, subsection (4) to section 81 is a penal provision 
incorporated in the scheme for the benefit of the 
assesse es/importers/exporters to save them from 
unnecessary harassment by the Customs Authorities 
by way of lingering on their cases for indefinite period 
on the pretext of finalizing the assessment. ’ 
 
And further that:  
 
‘In other words, when no final assessment is made in 
terms of subsection (2) to section 81, the provisional 
assessment will become final on declared value of 
goods by the assessee, and disbursement of additional 
amount or guarantee furnished by the importer/  
exporter, in terms of subsection (3) to  section 81, will 
be regulated on such premises. ’ 
 
Another Bench of the High Court of Sindh in the case of Dewan 
Farooque Motors Ltd v Customs, Excise and Sales Tax Appellate 
Tribunal7 by applying the principles enunciated in the Auto Mobile 
Corporation  case held that:  
                                       
7 2006 PTD 1276, p. 1281 B, decided by Muhammad Mujeebullah Siddiqui and 
Sajjad Ali Shah, JJ.  C. A. No. 565/2011, etc.  7
‘The admitted position in the present case also appears 
to be that the Customs Authorities have failed to 
finalize the assessment of the Respondent goods 
within the stipulated period as provided in sub -section 
(2) to section 81 of the Customs  Act, 1969. 
Consequently, the provisional assessment made by the 
Custom Authorities on the basis of declared value has 
attained finality. The ad hoc amount to meet the 
differential in case of final assessment thus became 
refundable to the appellant. ’ 
 
7. The learned Judges of the High Court in the said forty 
appeals had correctly applied the law, and did so in accordance 
with the stated precedent of this Court. It is also not the case of 
the appellants that the learned Judges had miscalculated the 
stipulate d periods prescribed in section 81 of the Act . The learned 
Judges were also correct in observing that there were no 
circumstances of exceptional nature  to justify the extension of the 
period. Therefore, said forty appeals are dismissed, but with no 
orders as to costs.  
 
8. As regards Civil Appeal No. 1070/2015 (arising out of CPLA 
No. 445 -K/2015) leave was granted on the basis of the leave 
granting order dated 21 September 2015 passed in CPLAs No. 805 -
K and 806 -K of 2009 , which became Civil Appeals No. 416 and 417 
of 2010 and were dismissed by the judgment of this Court dated 
10 December 2015. It is not understandable why Civil Appeal No. 
1070/2015 was not disposed of along with the said two appeals as 
leave was grant ed therein on the basis of the same leave  granting 
order dated 21 September 2015. Raja Muhammad Iqbal, the 
learned counsel representing the appellant, did not offer any 
explanation in this regard. Be that as it may, we have 
independently considered Civil A ppeal No. 1070/2015 on merit.  
 
9. The ap pellant  (in Civil Appeal No. 1070/2015),  representing 
the Customs authorities , had alleged that the respondent -importer 
had misdeclared the imported goods and was proceeded against C. A. No. 565/2011, etc.  8
under section 32 of the Act. The learned Judges of the High Court, 
after co nsidering the applicable notifications and the different 
provisions of the Act had concluded that the respondent was not 
liable thereunder , and allowed the Special Customs Reference No. 
218/2012. We have not been persuaded to take a different view of 
the m atter.  The learned counsel representing the appellant has 
also not been able to point out any illegality or material error in the 
impugned judgment. Therefore, Civil A ppeal No. 1070/2015 is 
dismissed, but with no order as to costs.
