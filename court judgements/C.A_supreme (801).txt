  The ECP has defended its impugned action on the 
basis of Rule 10(4) of the Election Rules , 2017 (“Rules ”). By that 
provision , the limits of  a Tapedar  Circle  should not be breached in 
the delimitation process. In the present case, the contention of the 
petitioner is that the delimitation in 2018 election without violating 
Tapedar  Circle was closer to the limits now being demand ed by the 
petitioner. In the present case, the plea being taken by the 
petitioners is that the difference in the number of voters in each of 
the three Provincial  Constituencies  in District Shikarpur  is more C.P.95/2023 etc  2
pronounce d and exce eds the variation limits set by Section 20(3)  of 
the Elections Act, 2017 ( “Act” ). On a challenge made by the 
petitioners on the above grounds, t he ECP passed an order under 
Section 22(1) of the Act holding that the information furnished by 
the petitioner was time barred . Whereas  there is no limitation 
prescribed for bringing information to the notice of the ECP  under 
the said provision.  Therefore , the ground taken in the order is 
invalid .  
 
2.  Be that as it may, the ECP is given an opportunity to 
consider whether it would  be willing to answer the petitioner ’s 
objection through a fresh order or would like to contest the matter 
before us.  
 
3.  Re-fix soon after the vacations.
