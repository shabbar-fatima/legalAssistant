ORDER  
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - After condoning the 
period of limitation (as under), we  heard the learned counsel for 
the parties at  some len gth and have gone through the impugned 
order , the record of the case and the law on the subject . We find 
that no ground for review of the impugned order  dated 01.08.2019 
is made out .  
2. We have  also noticed that one of the ground s for 
review is that the o rder under review is without any reason. The 
order  passed by this Court  on 01.08.2019 was  as under :- 
"We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners at 
some length and have gone through the impugned 
judgment of the High Court, the record of the case  and the 
law on the subject. We have not been able to take any 
exception to the reasoning of the impugned judgment and 
are of the view that it does not warrant any interference. 
Leave is , therefore, declined and these petitions are 
dismissed."  
It is emphas ised that if this Court, having examined  the judgment  
challenged before it , is satisfied with its reasoning  and conclusions 
and is of the view that it does not call for any interference,  this 
Court  can simply endorse the impugned judgment and adopt the 
reasoning of the  court below. In such a case , re-tracing the same C. R. P. 104-L-2019 etc. .doc. 2 
 
path travell ed by the court below appears to be  an unnecessary 
exercise and a waste of public time – time which  can be allocated 
to other cases where the decisions of the courts below have been  
overturned or modified. Finding no reversible error in the 
judgment, a concise, simple order  can suffice . On the other hand, 
if the Court is to  reverse or modify the judgment of the court below , 
the reasons for the reversal or modification must be set for th.1  
3. This approach  adopted by the court,  is by no means a 
short -cut which is  offensive to fair trial under Article 10 -A of the  
Cons titution nor does it in any manner undermine  due process 
and fair-play. It is simply a creative way forward that spares  the 
Court from writing opinions where a mere adoption of a well -
reasoned judgement of the court below through  a short order  
serves the purpose  adequately.  
4.  Nothing is cast in stone. Old practices evolve  with 
changing times. Burgeoning  population and the corresponding 
rapid increase in litigation require imaginative solutions. Courts all 
over the world have moved on to efficient time and case 
management techniques.  Therefore  this ground  for review is 
absolutely misconceived.  
5. As no ground for review is  made out, these civil review 
petitions are, therefore, dismissed.  
C.M.A.No s. 2831 -L/2019 and  3746 -L of 2019)  
6. These are applications for condonation of delay in 
filing the titled civil review petitions. For the reason s given  in the 
said applications, th e same are allowed.
