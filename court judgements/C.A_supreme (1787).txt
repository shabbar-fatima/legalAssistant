Date of Hearing  : 05.12.2012  
 
    O R D E R  
  On 12th October, 2012  a detailed  interim order was 
passed after holding about 71 hearings of the titled cases.  One of Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  4 
the observations , based on facts and circumstances  with regard 
to the enforcement of fundamental rights by the Provincial 
Government with the assistance of the Federal Government , 
reads as under: -  
 “Unfortunately in the instant case Federal 
Government except deploying FC t roops, has also 
failed to protect Province of Balochistan from 
internal disturbances.  Similarly, as far as Provincial 
Government of Balochistan is concerned it had lost 
its constitutional authority to govern the Province 
because of violation of fundamenta l rights of the 
people of Pakistan.”  
 
2.  Subsequent thereto reports were filed by the Provincial 
and Federal Governments and the case was taken up on 2nd and 
20th November, 2012.  I n the last mentioned order, the 
events/facts placed before this Court were  elaborately noted and 
in concluding para, following order was passed: -  
“In view of the above situation, learned counsel 
stated that some time be given to him so that he 
may discuss all these issues.  We are accepting his 
request but in the meanwhile we i ssue directions to 
the Provincial Government through its Chief 
Secretary that the minimum performance they 
should show before the next date of hearing is that 
at least missing persons should be recovered 
without any discrimination as to which area of the 
Province they belonged.  Similarly, efforts should be 
made to effect recovery of Munir Mirwani, Advocate, 
who is missing for the last about two years and Dr. 
Saeed Ahmed as early as possible.  Reference of the 
same should be made in the report to be filed o n or 
before the next date of hearing.  The Secretary, 
Interior, is also directed to assist the Provincial 
Government in overcoming the situation in terms of 
Article 148(3) of the Constitution” . 
 
3.  It is to be noted that two reports , one on behalf of 
Provincial (CMA No.5030 of 2012)  and the other by the Federal 
Government (CMA No.5031 of 2012) have been filed along with Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  5 
secret report pertaining to the events/steps which were taken for 
effecting r ecovery of Dr. Saeed Ahmed.  Th ough the report has 
been terme d as “Secret ” but in our opinion it only contains 
ineffective efforts of police to recover him as ultimately Dr. Saeed 
Ahmed got himself released from the clutches of the kidnappers 
after paying ransom of Rs.9.5 million.  However, we have 
returned the repo rt to the learned counsel appearing for the 
Government of Balochistan  (GOB) .  Another aspect of the case as 
has been pointed out by Mr. Baz Muhammad Khan Kakar, who 
has filed CMA No.4 997 of  2012  on behalf of Doctors , is that the 
Doctors protested for want of security to themselves despite clear 
commitment made by the Secretary Health, GOB and during their 
protest they were involved in criminal cases and by imposing an 
order under section 144 Cr.P.C . they were not allowed to enter 
the hospital s.  However, in  all fairness, we have pointed out to 
the learned counsel that the Doctors undoubtedly have a 
legitimate cause for being provided security by the Provincial 
Government particularly in view of the commitment made before 
this Court  during different hearings at Quetta , as at that time the 
Doctors had gone on strike but with the intervention of the Court, 
the strike was called of as assurance was given to them that they 
would be provided security  yet common people should not be 
deprived of medical care .  The le arned counsel , however , stated 
that they have also been proceeded against departmentally and Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  6 
show-cause notices have been issued to them , followed by 
suspension orders.  So much so  some of the Doctors who were 
not even in Quetta and had not participated in  any manner in the 
protest, have also been suspended  and notices have been issued 
to them for vacating their official accommodations etc.  Inter-alia 
prayer has been made for declaring the FIR s void, which ha ve 
been registered and also issuing directions t o the Government to 
reinstate the  Doctors as they are willing and i nclined to perform 
their duties.  Being member of noble profession, they are fully 
aware of their duties and according to the learned counsel except 
lodging protest they had not gone on str ike because they  are 
aware of its implications.  Be that as it may, learned counsel 
appearing for the Government of Balochistan assures that 
Doctors’ problem shall be settled amicably no sooner then the 
hearing of this case is over.   Let notice of CMA No.4 997/2012 be 
issued to the Government of Balochistan for the next date of 
hearing.  
4.  We have enquired from the learned counsel for GOB as 
to whether culprits involved in the case of Dr. Saeed Ahmed have 
been arrested.  He pointed out that the actual accus ed so far are 
still at large but some of the persons for the purpose of 
interrogation are in the custody of the police.  It is to be noted 
that during the last 2/3 months besides Dr. Saeed Ahmed, Dr. 
Ghulam Rasool was also abducted and he too got himself Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  7 
released after paying ransom of rupees one crore.  Besides, so 
many other Doctors arranged their release from custody of 
kidnappers through  their own efforts after paying  ransom.  Such 
a situation is self explanatory and no further elaboration or 
comment by  the Court is necessary except observing that the 
duty to enforce fundamental rights including protecting the life 
and property of the citizens lies upon the shoulders of the 
executive Government, wh ich is ruling the Province .   
5.  We ha d painfully noted in the concluding para of order 
dated 20.11.2012, that a minimum performance should be shown 
before the next date of hearing  by at  least effecting recovery of 
missing persons without any discrimination as to which area of 
the Province they belonged.   The learned counsel for GOB states 
that Muhammad Bux  has been found not to be missing while the 
two other persons namely, Samiullah  and Din Muhammad have 
not been found  to be  missing persons by the learned High Court 
as they, after commission of crime s made good their escape .  Be 
that as it may, in our opinion, such performance is not sufficient 
at all. The miseries of nears and dears ones of the missing 
persons, whose names are also available on our files, are 
increasing day by day. It may not be out of context  to observe 
that in some of such cases , as per version of the reports as well 
as the PPO/Inspector General of Police, Balochistan , the FC 
Personnel’s  are involved. In this behalf, there is sufficient Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  8 
material available in the shape of judicial inquir ies like in the 
matter of Abdul Maalik and Bansra.  In the case of Zafar Ullah, 
Zakir Majeed Baloch and Ali Hassan  Maingal FIRs have also been 
registered. In respect of Mehran Baloch and Muhammad Khan 
Marri cases have been registered , the DIG, CID ha d been asked  
to conduct investigation in the matter and it has come on record 
during the hearing of the case that no progress has been made. 
At the cost of repetition , we may observe that it is the 
constitutional responsibility of the Executive Government to 
ensure pr otection of the life, failing which all the legal 
consequences under the law and the constitution are bound to 
follow sooner or later but at present it is a matter of the 
commitment and duty under the Constitution. If someone 
believes that by consuming mor e time in locating missing persons 
or failing to provide protection to the  life and property  of citizens , 
the problem will go away, he/they are mistaken and are doing so 
at their own risk and c ost because  as far as the law and the 
Constitution is concerned , it has its own way to proceed and get 
itself implemented in letter and spirit.  
6.  We have also noted that Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned 
counsel for GOB, had submitted a report, perusal whereof 
indicates that despite of lapse of time since the passing of the 
order dated 12th October , the Executive Authorities, both the 
Federal and the Provincial, have failed to ensure protection to the Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  9 
life and property of the citizens. It is informed by Malik Zahoor 
Shahwani, President, High Court Bar Association (petitioner ) that 
after the  hearing of 2nd November , according to his estimate more 
than 25 to 30  persons had been killed including the incident 
which took place at Khuzdar on 2nd November where 18 -persons 
travelling in a Bus were fired upon and were killed .  Subsequ ent 
thereto  5-persons belonging to Asnah Ashrah  were killed . 
Similarly, Qazi Muhammad Jamil, an Advocate of Khuzdar was 
fired upon and he has been shifted to Karachi in a critical 
position. Advocates, Do ctors, Engineers and common me n do not 
feel themselve s protected. So much so the people are not ready 
to travel on the highways unless  security is provided to them 
particularly, the advocates wh o have to attend their cases in 
different places in the district s. We are also informed that despite 
the serious la w and order  situation  prevailing in the Province, the 
Executive ha s failed to take any effective  action such as the 
arrest of the accused persons  actually involved in the commission 
of offence s.  Not a single one has been arrested, except such 
persons agai nst whom no evidence is available, just to show 
progress and ultimately for want of evidence such persons are 
release d from custody.  
7.  From the facts and circumstances, we are constrained 
to conclude that no improvement has been made except that 
some lo ng term measures are being taken and in th is context Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  10 
learned counsel for the GOB pointed out that efforts are being 
made to seek assistance of the NADRA for the purpose of causing 
arrest of the accused persons by obtaining the facility of 
establishing contact direct ly with NADRA  inst ead of coming 
through the National Crises Management  Cell (NCMC) . He has 
also stated that efforts are being made for conducting a thorough 
scrutiny of the funds , which have been spent in the Province by 
making a request to the A uditor General. The Provincial or the 
Federal executive are free to do whatever they like because our 
concern  in the instant case is enforcement of the Constitutional 
provisions. Learned Advocate General  and leaned counsel for GOB  
stated that they would be  addressing arguments before this Court 
about the constitutional position of the Provincial Government as 
according to them no review petition has been filed against the 
order dated 12.10.2012.  On the last date of hearing i.e. 20th 
November, the learned c ounsel for GOB had also pointed out that 
during the Joint Parliamentary Group Meeting  he informed them 
about the implications of the order s passed by this Court 
reference of which has been made in the order of 12th October , 
2012. The relevant para of the s aid order is reproduced herein 
above. However, he stated that there are judgments that such an 
order can be passed. Be that as it may, the concerned 
authorities/executive, both Provincial and the Federal instead of 
arguing the case o n these points , may con sider the constitutional Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  11 
provision s for the purpose o f remed ying the situation, which is 
prevailing in the Province. We may make it clear that this Court 
had not expressed a single word in respect of Provincial 
Assembly .  The order pertains to the Provinci al Government  and 
represent ative of the executive s not to the legislat ure, who have 
lost their authority because of non -enforc ement  of fundamental 
rights of protect ion o f the life and property of civilians and law 
enforcing agencies, details of which have also been discussed 
herein above, therefore, it is for them to enforce the Constitution 
according to its mandate .   
8.  A Resolution was passed by the Provincial Assembly on 
04.12.2012 , which is reproduced  as under : - 
 
 
 
9.  Mr. Riaz Ahmad, learned counse l appearing for M ir Siraj 
Raeesani , stated that his son Mir Haqmal Khan Raeesani, was 
brutally murdered and despite the direction of this Court, no 
progress so far has been made. It is to be noted that on an 
earlier date of hearing we ha d also pointed out the lack of Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc  12 
progress in this behalf to the executive but it seems that no 
progress has been made so far although a report has been 
submitted.   The learned counsel stated that he would go through 
the report and would make submissions on the next date of 
hearing. We have returned the report and in the meanwhile DIG, 
CID to whom this case was entrusted should take interest to 
cause arrest of the accused. One Ali Muhammad Abu Turrab 
stated that his brother Habib Ullah Mujahid,  Director of Jamia 
Salfia Residenti al College was abducted more than 5 months  ago.  
The culprits are in contact and are demanding ransom .  They at 
one time agreed to receive rupees sixty lac but thereafter back ed 
out.  All these facts have been brought in the notice of the police 
but no pro gress has been made. Inspector General of Police 
present in the Court is directed to take interest in these cases as 
well for effecting recovery.  
10.  Dr. M. Shamim Rana, learned counsel for the FBR 
stated that after the directions of this Court 626 vehic les, which 
were brought into Pakistan without custom duty , have been 
impounded so far.  He requested for further time to accelerate 
the efforts.  The learned counsel for the petitioner and the 
learned counsel appearing for the PMA stated that unregistered 
vehicles are being plied freely throughout the Province except 
Quetta where the owners of such vehicles have become careful 
and only take out such vehicles at a time when they feel no Const.Petition No.77 of 2010 etc
 13 
apprehension that their vehicles will be impounded.  The 
Chairman, FBR i s directed to instruct the Collectors (Customs), 
posted in Balochistan to accelerate their efforts through out the 
Province instead of concentrating  only on Quetta City as 
reportedly most of the vehicles are not custom paid and are being 
plied outside Quett a in different cities.  
  CMA No.2346  OF 2012
 
11.  Mr. Raza Kazim, Sr. ASC, stated that his clients (Mobile 
Operators)  have received letter dated 13th November, 2012 , 
issued by the Director General (Enforcement),  Pakistan 
Telecommunication Authority.  Copy of the same shall be filed by 
him during course of the day.  The learned counsel stated that 
order dated 21.05.2012 , passed in this case is being implemented 
for the whole country although this Court had made a direction 
only for the Province of Balochista n.  Notice be issued to  the PTA, 
Advocate General , Balochistan as well as Inspector General of 
Police , Balochistan,  for the next date of hearing.  
12.  Let the case be adjourned to a date after two weeks .  
On the next date, t he case is likely to be heard at  Quetta, subject 
to availability of the Bench.
