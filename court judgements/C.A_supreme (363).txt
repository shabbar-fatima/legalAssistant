ORDER  
 
 Arguments in these connected appeals were heard on several 
dates of h earing, during which, on 12.4.2016, some suggestions were also 
exchanged between the learned ASC s for the appellant and respondents CA-760/2016, etc  2
No.1, 3 and 9. In response to it, following  written  formulations have been 
sent today by Dr. Muhammad Farogh Nas eem, learned  ASC.  
“Formulation and Written Arguments on behalf of MQM and 
PML(F).  
Further to write -up dated 6.4.2016 and the Addendum dated 7.4.2016 
the Respondents are filing the present 2nd Addendum.  
2. The undersigned appears on behalf of MQM and PML(F), whose 
instructions are as follows: - 
a) with regard to the issue of youth seats, neither MQM nor 
PML(F) filed any petition in the High Court and hence 
they are not aggrieved on this issue.  
b) with regard to women seats, both MQM and PML(F) are 
also neutral with regar d to the percentage of the seats.  
3. Both MQM and PML(F) are of the considered view that all 
indirect elections in the Local government elections, whether they 
pertain to Mayors, Deputy Mayors , Chairmen and Vice Chairmen should 
be conducted through secret ballot and not through show of hands. Also 
no bureaucratic transfer should be made by the government except upon 
permission from the ECP, after the announcement of the elections.  
4. The distinction attempted to be brought about by the Appellant 
that the in direct elections for Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Chairmen and 
Vice Chairmen are separate elections is incorrect. All elections to the 
Local Government are part and parcel of each other, as one leads to 
another. It is settled law that election starts from the fi rst step and 
includes all subsequent steps till the culmination. Hence, the law which 
was applicable on the first date of the announcement of elections i.e. 
25.8.2015 (reference is invited to para 4 of the undersigned’s first write -
up) will be applicable r ight till the end when the elections of Mayors, 
Deputy Mayors, Chairmen and Vice Chairmen so also the reserved seats 
would culminate.”  
2. After hearing the learned ASCs for the parties  at length , for the 
reasons to be recorded separately, these appeals are  partly allowed in the 
following terms: - 
(i) The amendment brought into effect by the Province of Sindh 
vide Sindh Local Government (Third Amendment) Act, 2015 
(Sindh Act No.XXXVIII of 2015 ) with effect from 25.8.2015, 
as regards introduction of 05 percent  reserved seats for 
“Youth ” and increase in the number of reserved seats for 
women from 22 percent to 33 percent, is held to be validly 
legislated;  thus, to remain operative.  CA-760/2016, etc  3
(ii) With the consent of the appellant and respondents No.1, 3 & 
9, all the reser ved seats as prescribed under section 18 shall 
be filled up in terms of section 18A of the Sindh Local 
Government Act, 2013 , which will be revived and such 
amendment will be brought into effect by the appellant 
immediately . In case requisite legislative am endment is not 
made within two weeks, these seats shall be filled up in the 
manner  as otherwise prescribed by law . 
(iii) The elections for the posts of Mayor, Deputy Mayor, 
Chairm an and Vice Chairm an are to be held under the 
Constitution and the law i.e.  the Sindh Local Government Act, 
2013 , therefore, it is within the competence of the Sindh 
Government to legislate law to hold such elections either 
through show  of hand s or secret ballot. However, in the 
present case, since such amendment has been brought i nto 
effect under section 18 (ibid)  on 18.1.2016, after the 
announcement of Election Schedule  on 26.8.2015 , therefore, 
such amendment is of no legal effect, and as per the Sindh Act 
No.XXXVIII of 2015 , the ensuing elections for these posts will 
be held thro ugh secret ballot.  
(iv) All notifications regarding transfers and posting of 
bureaucrats issued by the appellant after the date of 
announcement of Election Schedule for Sindh Local Bodies 
i.e. 30.5.2015, without prior approval from Respondent 
No.6, the Ele ction Commission of Pakistan , are declared to 
be without jurisdiction and of no legal effect.  
(v) The Election Commission of Pakistan shall ensure 
completion of remaining election process of local bodies in 
Sindh for the reserved seats as well as for the o ffice of Mayor, CA-760/2016, etc  4
Deputy Mayor, Chairman and Vice Chairman within 60 days 
from today.  
3.  The impugned judgment of the High Court is accordingly 
modified in the above terms.  
4.  A copy of this order be sent through Fax to the Secretary, 
Election Commission o f Pakistan ; Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh, 
and other concerned authorities for their information and compliance.
