C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  1  
 
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.-    
 I have had the privilege to go through the judgment  of my 
learned brother Mushir Alam, J., with which Faisal Arab, J. has 
concurred. I, with respect, have not been able to agree with the 
majority view for the reasons discussed hereunder. As matter of 
background I had recorded a dissenting view in the judgment 
under review. While I maintain my view I hear the present review 
petitions not as a judge carrying a dissenting view but as a 
member of the Bench that delivered the judgment under review.   
Constitution of a Review Bench 
2. It may be pertinent to state that initially a three 
member Bench was constituted to hear these review petitions of 
which I as a dissenting judge was not a member. Perhaps for the 
reason that Order XXVI Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, 
which requires that the same Bench to hear the review petition, 
was over-looked. Subsequently, the roster was revised and I was 
also made a member of the Bench, making it a four member 
Bench. The four-member Bench sat and unanimously decided to 
bring that aforesaid provisions of the Rules to the notice of the 
Hon’ble Chief Justice for re-constitution of the Bench, vide order 
dated 21.10.2020. The present Bench, which had earlier heard the 
case and delivered the impugned judgment, was thus constituted. 
This made me examine the office noting contained in the file. There 
seems to be lack of clarity regarding the meaning and scope of 
Order XXVI Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. I, therefore, 
before going into the merits of the case wish to state the legal 
position in this regard. 
3. Article 188 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”) states that the Supreme Court 
shall have power, subject to the provisions of any Act of Majlis-e-
Shoora (Parliament) and of any rules made by the Supreme Court, 
to review any judgment pronounced or any order made by it. The 
Parliament has not so far passed any Act under this Article; Order 
XXVI of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, however, contains the 
rules that regulate the power of review of the Court. Rule 8 of that C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  2  
 
Order is relevant to the question under discussion. It is, therefore, 
reproduced hereunder for ease of reference: 
8. As far as practicable the application for review shall 
be posted before the same Bench that delivered the 
judgment or order sought to be reviewed. 
Rule 8 very clearly and firmly prescribes that the application for 
review shall, as far as practicable, be posted before the “same 
Bench” that delivered the judgment or order sought to be reviewed. 
The expression “same Bench” leaves little room to speculate the 
constitution of the Bench: the “same Bench” means the same 
judges, as far as practicable, and the same number of judges, i.e., 
the same numeric strength of the Bench. There is no ambiguity in 
this regard, in the said rule. Mian Saqib Nisar, J., in the review1 of 
Judges’ Pension case  observed:   
There is great wisdom in law, that the review, generally 
and ordinarily, should be heard by the same Court 
and the Court in this context is an interchangeable 
term with the Judge 
4. A seven-Member Full Court Bench of this Court heard 
the review petition in Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case.2 The main appeal3 in 
that case was decided by a majority of four to three Judges. All the 
Judges comprising majority and minority, both, were on the Bench 
hearing the review of the majority judgment. While deciding an 
application4 made for adding two other Judges on the review 
Bench,  Anwarul Haq, C.J., speaking for the Bench, held:  
 
The position under the Supreme Court Rules is clear 
and unambiguous. Rule 6 of Order XXVI lays down 
that "as far as practicable the application for review 
shall be posted before the same Bench that delivered 
the judgment or order sought to be reviewed". Now, in 
the present case, the judgment under review was 
delivered by seven Judges of this Court, who are all 
available on the Bench for the disposal of the Review 
Petition. There is, accordingly, no justification for any 
departure or deviation from the relevant rule just 
mentioned.

A question as to the inclusion of the three learned Judges who 
gave the dissenting judgment, in the Bench hearing the review 
petition also arose in that case, and it was held that as they were 
part of “the Bench that delivered the judgment sought to be 
reviewed” and were “available for the disposal of the review 
petition”, their presence on the Bench was necessary. Muhammad 
Akram, J., mentioned the said decision of the Bench on this 
question, in his final order5 made on the review petition, thus: 
At a subsequent stage a question arose as to the 
position of the three learned Judges of this Court who 
had recorded dissenting opinions in regard to the 
disposal of the petitioner's appeal. Again, relying upon 
the aforesaid rule 6, we took the view that as they were 
part of the Bench that delivered the judgment sought 
to be reviewed, their presence on the Bench was 
necessary, as they were continuing as Judges of the 
Supreme Court and were available for the disposal of 
the review petition.  
(Emphasis added)  
The notable point in the phrases underlined in the above quoted 
observations of Anwarul Haq, C.J. , and Muhammad Akram, J., are 
that they both mentioned that the judgment sought to be reviewed 
was delivered by the Bench comprising seven judges of the Court.    
They did not consider that judgment as the judgment delivered by 
only four Judges comprising the majority. These observations of 
their lordships are in line with the language of Rule 8, which 
contains the expression “same Bench that delivered the judgment 
or order sought to be reviewed”, and not the majority Members of 
the Bench who delivered the majority judgment or order sought to 
be reviewed. 
5. It is well-established practice of this Court that when a 
case is heard by a Bench of two or more Judges, the case is 
decided in accordance with the opinion of such Judges or of the 
majority of such Judges. Judgment or order of the Court is 
pronounced in terms of the majority opinion; such judgment or 
order is of the Bench that heard the case and, for that matter, of 
the Court, and not only of the Judges whose opinion prevailed as a 
majority opinion. This is why a unanimous opinion of a five-
                                                           
5 PLD 1979 SC 741. C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  4  
 
Member Bench on a legal question can be overruled by a majority 
of four Judges while sitting in a seven-Member Bench. It is the 
numeric strength of the whole Bench that determines the judicial 
power of its Members, and not the numbers of the individual 
Judges in majority. Justice Nariman of the Indian Supreme Court 
has stated this position in Shanti Fragrances v. Union of India ,6 as 
under:  
Under the present practice, it is clear that the view of 
four learned Judges speaking for the majority in a 7 
Judge Bench will prevail over a unanimous 5 Judge 
Bench decision, because they happen to speak for a 7 
Judge bench.7 
It is also a well-established principle of precedent that judgment of 
a larger Bench of this Court is binding on the Benches of this 
Court consisting of Judges less than that larger Bench.8 A smaller 
Bench cannot request for constitution of a larger Bench to revisit 
the opinion of a larger Bench on any question or principle of law; 
only a Bench of co-equal strength can make such request.9 This   
principle also necessitates that the Judge who dissented from the 
majority judgment should be Member of the Bench that is to hear 
the review petition, as a judgment pronounced in terms of the 
majority opinion of a larger Bench cannot be reviewed by a smaller 
Bench consisting of only the Judges holding the majority opinion. 
It is utmost necessary to maintain quorum of the Bench that 
delivered the judgment under review. It is because of this legal 
compulsion, that new Members are added to the Bench when any 
of its earlier Members retires or is not available for any other 
reason, to maintain the quorum of the Bench for hearing the 
review petition. Many instances may be cited in this regard: 
Gadoon Textiles Mills case10 was decided by a five-Member Bench 
with three-two majority. The review petitions11 were filed against 
the majority judgment. The dissenting judges, Justices Saleem 
Akhtar and Fazal Karim, had retired by the time the review 
                                                           
6 (2018) 11 SCC 305.  
7 He has though expressed his desire to review this principle. 
8 See Muhammad Saleem v. Fazal Ahmad, 1997 SCMR 315; Babar Shehzad v. Said Akbar, 1999 
SCMR 2518; All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation, PLD 2004 SC 600; Ata Ullah v. Surraya 
Parveen, 2006 SCMR 1637; Azhar Siddiqui v. Federation, PLD 2012 SC 774, para 37. 
9 See Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2005 SC 752. 
10 Gadoon Textiles Mills v. WAPDA, 1997 SCMR 641. 
11 Gandaf Steel Industries v. Federation, 1997 SCMR 1669. C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  5  
 
petitions were taken up for hearing; therefore, other Judges were 
added to the Bench to maintain the quorum of five Members, for 
hearing the review petitions. Benazir Bhutto case12 was decided by 
a seven-Member Bench with six-one majority. The review petition13 
filed against the majority judgment of six Judges was heard by the 
Bench of seven Judges, not of six Judges. The quorum of the 
Bench was, thus, maintained for hearing the review petition. There 
are many other cases14 of our jurisdiction as well as the Indian 
jurisdiction wherein the dissenting Judges were part of the 
Benches that heard the review petitions against the judgments of 
the Court pronounced in terms of the majority opinion. It can, 
therefore, be safely concluded that a judge who dissented from the 
majority judgment, if available, must be Member of the Bench for 
hearing the review petition filed against that majority judgment.  
6. So far as the scope of jurisdiction and judicial power of 
such Judge in hearing the review petition against the majority 
judgment is concerned, there is nothing in the Constitution or the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980 that limits his jurisdiction and judicial 
power in a review in comparison with the Judges who delivered a 
majority judgment. He is a Member of the Bench with same 
jurisdiction and power like the other Members of that Bench. As 
afore-explained, the judgment pronounced or order made in terms 
of the majority opinion is the judgment or order of the Bench, and 
not of the Judges holding the majority opinion.  
7. Rule 1 of Order XXVI of the Supreme Court Rules, 
1980 provides that subject to the law and the practice of the Court, 
the Court may review its judgment or order in a Civil proceeding on 
grounds similar to those mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule I of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and in a criminal proceeding on the 
ground of an error apparent on the face of the record. As per Order 
XLVII, Rule I of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the discovery of

13 Benazir Bhutto v. President of Pakistan, PLD 2000 SC 77. 
14 See Nawaz Sharif v. Imran Khan, PLD 2018 SC 1 (Justices Asif Saeed Khosa and Gulzar Ahmed, 
the dissenting Judges, were on the Bench); Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar, AIR 1987 SC 
877 (Justice Tulzapurkar, the dissenting Judge, was on the Bench that admitted the review for 
hearing); Shyam Lal Sharma v. Union of India, AIR 1987 SC 1137 (Justice Thakkar, the dissenting 
Judge, was on the Bench to which the review petition was presented for decision by circulation. C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  6  
 
new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of 
due diligence, was not within knowledge of the applicant or could 
not be produced by him at the time when the judgment was 
pronounced or order made, some mistake or error apparent on the 
face of the record, and any other sufficient reason are the grounds 
for review of a judgment or order made in a civil proceeding. These 
grounds of review which are, in fact, limitations on the power of 
review of this Court applies equally to the Judges whose opinion 
prevails for being the majority view and to the Judge whose 
opinion remains inoperative for being the minority view. The Judge 
whose opinion remained the minority view in the main case can 
review the Judgment of the Bench that was pronounced in terms of 
the majority opinion, on any of the said grounds of review, as can a 
Judge who delivered the majority opinion.  
8. In Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto review case,15 review petition was 
dismissed unanimously by all the seven Judges who were divided 
into four-three in the judgment pronounced in the main appeal 
case.16 Muhammad Akram, J. speaking for the majority dismissed 
the review petition with the observations that “the errors and 
omissions pointed out by [the petitioner’s counsel]…have been 
found by us to be of inconsequential import, having no material 
bearing upon the fundamental and essential conclusions reached 
in the majority Judgment as to the guilt of the petitioner, on the 
various counts on which his convictions have been upheld, as well 
on the question of sentence.” And Dorab Patel, J. speaking for the 
minority also held that the review petition had to be dismissed and 
further agreed with the view of Akram, J. that the question of 
sentence could not be raised in a review petition, and if they were 
to alter the sentence in this review, they would be unsettling the 
settled law. Similar is the legal position in Indian jurisdiction: In 
the case of Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar ,17 Justice 
Tulzapurkar, the Judge who earlier dissented with the majority 
judgment, was on the review-Bench, and admitted the review 
against the majority judgment for hearing, along-with two other

Judges, i.e., one Judge who was earlier party to the majority 
judgment and the other judge added due to non-availability of a 
Judge18 in majority. Tulsiram  case19 was decided by a five-Judge 
Bench of the Indian Supreme Court with four-one majority. Justice 
Thakkar delivered the dissenting opinion. The review petitions20 
filed against the majority judgment were dismissed in limine  by the 
four Judges, but Justice Thakkar held that the issues raised in the 
review petitions needed examination and the Review Petitions 
deserved to be admitted for hearing.  
9. A judgment of the Federal Court of Malaysia delivered 
in the case of Terengganu Forest Products v. Cosco Container 
Lines21 may also be referred to on this point. The Federal Court, in 
that case, did not accept the argument that a judge who dissents 
at leave granting stage should not sit on the Bench hearing appeal, 
with the reason that the issues, considerations and arguments at 
the leave stage are different from that of the appeal hearing stage. 
Likewise, the considerations and grounds at the hearing of the 
review petition are different from that of the original hearing of the 
case; therefore, the judge who dissented at the original hearing of 
the case can sit on the review-Bench, and examine the 
considerations and grounds of review while hearing the review 
petition. There is another aspect of the matter to look at, i.e., when 
a Member newly added in the review Bench due to non-availability 
of an earlier Member, who was not earlier even part of the Bench, 
can make review of judgment, then how can any restriction or 
limitation be imposed on the jurisdiction and judicial power of 
review of the Member who earlier dissented. There are several 
instances when Members newly added on the Bench had recalled 
or reversed the original judgment or order in review jurisdiction 
despite contrary view of the Member who had earlier authored the 
judgment of the Court.22 It can, therefore, be said with certainty 
that the jurisdiction and judicial power of the Judge who earlier 
dissented from the majority judgment of the Bench is similar and

co-extensive with that of those Judges whose opinion became the 
majority judgment of the Bench, in hearing the review petition 
against that majority judgment.   
Grounds of Review  
10. A number of grounds highlighting errors apparent on 
the face of the record were agitated seeking review of the impugned 
judgment. It was argued: (i) that the principle of co-relation 
between the collection and expenditure of the amount of Cess as 
settled in the judgment under review was applied to stop further 
recovery of Cess, but it was not extended to restrain the collection 
of arrears of Cess, inspite of the fact that no developmental 
expenditure has taken place since 2011 and the Government has 
already collected Cess in excess of what is required for the 
foreseeable Projects; (ii) that the Court ordered that in case no 
work is carried out on North-South Gas Pipeline within six 
months, the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess Act, 2015 
("GIDC Act")  would become permanently in-operational and 
considered dead for all intents and purposes, but has not made 
any order regarding return of the Cess collected to their payers or 
how and for what purpose the Cess collected would then be 
expended; (iii) that the decision of the Sindh High Court in 377 
suits declaring the GIDC Act to be ultra vires  the Constitution, 
being res judicata,  has attained finality between the parties to 
those suits as it went unchallenged by the Federal Government, 
hence arrears, as well as, recovery of Cess in future could not be 
demanded of the petitioners who are decree holders in those suits. 
It was urged that the view expressed by a four-member Bench of 
this Court in Pir Bakhsh23 was not fully appreciated; (iv) that the 
Second Schedule of the Act giving different maximum rates of Cess 
for different sectors is discriminatory as it lacks reasonable 
classification, giving no intelligible differentia  that has any rational 
nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the statute in 
question; (v) that while interpreting Entry 51 of Part I of the 
Federal Legislative List the impugned judgment has disagreed with, 
rather overruled, the interpretation made in Durrani Ceramics . It 
                                                           
23 PLD 1987 SC 145 C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  9  
 
was urged that this point was never pleaded before the Court by 
the parties and no arguments were heard on the point besides this 
Bench being of co-equal strength could not have so done as per the 
settled principles of precedent; (vi) that the GIDC Act does not fall 
within the scope of Entry No.27 of Part-I of the Federal Legislative 
List. It was submitted that the petitioners were not heard on this 
point before holding the said Entry applicable to the GIDC Act; (vii) 
that the petitioners have been wrongly deprived of the benefit of 
the first proviso to Section 8(2) of the GIDC Act by making order of 
recovering arrears of the Cess that are exempted under that 
proviso; and (viii) that the statement made in the impugned 
judgment that the Cess collected may form part of the Federal 
Consolidated Fund is not consistent with the Constitutional 
provisions. 
11. My learned brothers have dealt with only two grounds: 
one, relating to res judicata  and the other, regarding proviso to 
Section 8(2) of the GIDC Act. They have disposed of other grounds 
with the observation that “Several other grounds also urged before 
us but none of the grounds in our considered view call for review”. 
I, thus, do not have the advantage to see the reasons that prevailed 
with their lordships in rejecting those grounds. My learned 
brothers have clarified that the impugned judgment has not held 
that “the benefit granted under Section 8(2) ibid, which has been 
extended to a particular class of the consumers of gas on certain 
conditions shall not be extended.” I respectfully agree with this 
clarification. However, on the ground of res judicata  I have a 
different view that I shall explain later herein. 
 
Co-relation of collection and expenditure of Cess.   
12. I now advert to the question whether there is any 
visible co-relation between the collection of Cess and expenditure 
therefrom. The impugned judgment held: 
20…….The other kind of a fee-levying legislation is 
where Cess is imposed as a compulsory exaction in the 
same manner where taxes are imposed with the 
distinction that it is imposed for achieving a specific 
purpose promised in the enactment itself which when 
realized would bring some advantage or benefit for the C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  10  
 
payers in future. It can be described as ‘purpose 
specific’ and in many judicial pronouncements have 
been termed as ‘Cess-fee’. In such a form of levy, the 
specified purpose is pre-committed to the payers 
before the revenue is collected under the legislation. To 
quote a few examples, Cess is imposed to meet the 
extraordinary costs involved in providing 
infrastructure such as construction of dams or for 
importing oil or gas from abroad through pipelines or 
to build farm to mill roads in order to facilitate 
marketing of the agricultural produce or for 
conducting research and development in some 
specialized field. In such a form of levy the rule of quid 
pro quo does not exist in the same sense as it exists in 
a case where an existing service is rendered or a 
privilege is extended directly to the payer for a fee. 
What needs to be taken into consideration is whether 
the enactment has promised some benefit or 
advantage for the payers to be made available in future 
by utilizing the revenue, making it more akin to a fee 
then a pure revenue raising measure like taxes in 
general are imposed with no precondition attached for 
their spending.  
25. When Cess as a fee is levied to meet an earmarked 
financial exigency spelt out in an enactment, it 
preserves the levy for such purpose only even with the 
change in the government setup. It cannot be levied as 
a general revenue collecting tool and the government 
would not be justified to collect it if the funds are 
diverted to some other expenditure…..The proceeds of 
Cess should be clearly identifiable in the accounts by 
using separate accounting codes so that its collection 
and utilization is reconcilable with the purposes stated 
in the enactment. A correlation between the revenue 
collected and the expenditure incurred for the 
promised specific purpose should always be 
maintained. In this manner the earmarked levy also 
provides information on the amount collected and 
spent. This also inculcates confidence in the payers as 
it contains the promise that the revenue would be 
utilized for the specific purpose only for which it was 
collected and they would have a claim to transparency 
and accountability of the utilization of the revenue so 
collected. They can claim that the revenue cannot be 
utilized for any other purpose other than for which 
they have been charged. When the revenue can only be 
utilized for the purpose promised in the fee-levying 
enactment then in that sense the levy could also be 
regarded as a temporary levy. Once the purpose for 
which it was imposed stands served, the justification 
for its imposition also comes to an end. The collection 
of Cess therefore should be based on some calculation 
keeping in view the funding requirements and as and 
when the purpose is achieved, the government loses it 
right to collect Cess regardless of the fact that the 
enactment continues to remain in force.  C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  11  
 
The principle settled by this Court was that there must exist a 
visible co-relation between the collection of Cess and its 
expenditure. In a case where the fee is to be utilized for service that 
is to be rendered in future, it is important to see how the moneys 
collected are being expended and whether there is a transparent 
and confidence inspiring co-relation between the two. The other 
principle settled was that the amount of Cess so collected is for a 
specified purpose and must be accounted for accordingly.  It is not 
the collection of general revenue which can be utilized anywhere. 
Relying on these principles settled in the impugned judgment, 
further collection of Cess was stopped in the following manner:  
42. ……However, keeping in view the ground realities 
discussed in the preceding paragraph and the fact that 
around 295 billion rupees have already been collected 
towards Cess-revenue and together with the 
outstanding amount the total sum by the end of this 
month would be in the vicinity of seven hundred 
billion rupees, which is more than what is the 
estimated cost of the projects mentioned in Section 4 
of the GIDC Act, 2015, we are constraint to issue 
following directions: -  
(i)  From the date of this judgment, we restrain 
the Federal Government from charging Cess 
which power of the Federal Government shall 
remain suspended until the Cess-revenue 
collected and that which is accrued so far but 
not yet collected is expanded on the projects 
listed in Section 4 of the GIDC Act, 2015.  
According to the figures given by the Government the Cess 
collected as on 30.06.2019 was as under:

The above working shows that the Government already has         
Rs. 101.357 in excess after factoring in the expenditure to be 
incurred on TAPI Gas Pipeline, North South Gas Pipeline and 
Underground Gas Storages unless the Iran Pak (IP) Project is put 
into motion. The co-relation between the collection and the 
expenditure stands completely frozen since 2011 raising fingers on 
the credibility and transparency of the Projects and on the C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  13  
 
availability of service (supply of natural gas) against the fee 
charged, in the near future. The direction for further collection of 
arrears in the sum of Rs 456.946 billion leading to an excess of   
Rs 355.589 billion unduly promotes unjust enrichment and 
seriously offends the right to property and business of the 
petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution. The status of the 
Projects submitted before this Court during the hearing of these 
review petitions reveals that the Government plans to start the 
North South Gas Pipeline (NSGP) Project only. This Project will not 
generate natural gas but is a support infrastructural Project and 
will not redress the shortage of natural gas in the country. The 
Government without any further collection of fresh amount of Cess 
or the arrears has an excess amount in the sum of  Rs.101 billion 
including the expenditure for TAPI which has not even begun as 
yet. The impugned judgment though stops further collection of 
Cess on the principle that there has been no expenditure and no 
development on the Projects mentioned in the Act yet at the same 
time allows recovery of arrears in the sum of Rs. 456.946 billion.   
Reference is made to Chapter 14 on “Energy” in the Pakistan 
Economic Survey 2019-2020 which states: 
Pakistan is successfully overcoming energy crisis, 
which has direct and indirect impact on all sectors of 
the economy. Presently, Energy Sector is confronted 
with demand supply gap....in terms of energy-mix, 
Pakistan’s reliance on thermal which includes 
imported coal, local coal and RLNG and natural gas 
has been decreasing over the last few years. 
Pakistan’s dependence on natural gas in the overall 
energy mix is on decline and the reduction of its 
share in the energy mix may be attributed to 
declining natural gas reserves as well as to the 
introduction of LNG since 2015 .  
Gas Sector  
Natural Gas is a clean, safe, efficient and environment 
friendly fuel. Its indigenous supplies contribute about 
38 percent in total primary energy supply mix of the 
country. Pakistan produces around four (4) Billion 
Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcfd) of indigenous natural gas 
against an unconstrained demand of over six (6) Bcfd. 
To meet the shortfall, the GoP has initiated the 
import of LNG . (emphasis supplied)   
 C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  14  
 
Pakistan Economic Survey is silent regarding these Projects since 
2015 and shows that the shortfall in natural gas is being 
successfully plugged through the import of LNG, which 
surprisingly, is not a GIDC funded Project. The above documents 
show that after a decade of charging GIDC from gas consumers 
and after having collected Rs 295.40 billion to-date there is no sign 
of development of the gas pipeline projects in Pakistan. Absence of 
the said projects and emphasis on the import of LNG in the latest 
Pakistan Economic Survey hazards a guess that the Government of 
Pakistan is either not willing to or is unable to complete these 
projects and therefore the shortfall in gas supply is being 
increasingly plugged through LNG imported from Qatar. There is a 
huge disconnect between the principle settled by the Court and its 
application leading to a material omission in assessing the correct 
ground and factual reality. The direction to recover arrears is, 
therefore, against the principle settled by this Court and is not 
justified and legally sustainable and is liable to be recalled.  
Deposit of Cess (GIDC) in the Federal Consolidated Fund 
13. The other principle established in the impugned 
judgment was:  
25. ……It cannot be levied as a general revenue 
collecting tool and the government would not be 
justified to collect it if the funds are diverted to some 
other expenditure…..The proceeds of Cess should be 
clearly identifiable in the accounts by using separate 
accounting codes so that its collection and utilization 
is reconcilable with the purposes stated in the 
enactment. A correlation between the revenue collected 
and the expenditure incurred for the promised specific 
purpose should always be maintained. 
38…it matters not if the revenue so collected forms 
part of the Federal Consolidated Fund as it is the 
mandate of Article 78 of the Constitution itself that all 
revenues of the Federal Government has to made part 
of Federal Consolidated Fund. 
The learned DAG was asked time and again during the hearing to 
provide the statement of GIDC account within the Federal 
Consolidated Fund but he failed to furnish the statement of 
account and instead furnished a general statement showing the 
amount so far collected to be Rs. 307.23 billion as on 30.07.2020. 
Initial reluctance and then the failure on the part of the Federal C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  15  
 
Government to place on record the statement of the account of 
GIDC gives rise to an adverse inference against the Federal 
Government under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 
1984. It shows that the collected amount of Rs. 307.23 billion is 
not physically present in the account and has already been 
expended elsewhere. This offends the principle settled by the 
Court. Additionally, it is also highlighted that even today the 
amount of GIDC has been shown as a Tax Revenue in the Annual 
Budget Statements for the year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 as 
under:

14. The above Annual Budget Statements for the year 
2019-2020 and 2020-2021 show the said collection under the 
head “other tax revenue” as a part of Federal Consolidated Fund. 
Provinces are paid their respective shares under the National 
Finance Commission Award24 from the Federal Consolidated Fund, 
and the possibility of the amount of GIDC being distributed 
amongst the Provinces cannot be ruled out.  This Court, in the 
                                                           
24 Prescribed Share of all Provinces under the Distribution of Revenues and Grants-in-Aids Order, 
2010 C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  17  
 
impugned judgment, held that “it matters not if the revenue so 
collected forms part of the Federal Consolidated Fund as it is the 
mandate of Article 78 of the Constitution itself that all revenues of 
the Federal Government has to made part of Federal Consolidated 
Fund.”25 The Court in the impugned judgment ordered that “in 
case no work is carried out on North-South Gas Pipeline within the 
prescribed time and for laying any of the two other major pipelines 
(IP and TAPI) though the political conditions become conducive, the 
purpose of levying Cess shall be deemed to have been frustrated 
and the GIDC Act, 2015 would become permanently in-operational 
and considered dead for all intents and purposes.” In that 
eventuality, the amount of Fee already collected under the GIDC 
Act will have to be refunded to the payers of fee. It would not be 
possible for the Federal Government to refund the same, if the 
amount of GIDC is made part of the Federal Consolidated Fund 
and shown as an amount available for general expenditures of the 
Government in the Annual Budget Statement.   
15. Article 78(1) of the Constitution provides that all 
revenues received by the Federal Government, all loans raised by 
that Government, and all moneys received by it in repayment of 
loans shall form part of consolidated fund, to be known as the 
Federal Consolidated Fund. While all other moneys received by or 
on behalf of the Federal Government, or received by or deposited 
with the Supreme Court or any other court established under the 
authority of the Federation are to be credited to the Public Account 
of the Federation as per Article 78(2) of the Constitution. The 
expression “all revenues” used in Article 78(1) covers the revenues 
(taxes, duties, etc) raised for Governmental purposes, and does not 
include the revenue that cannot be used for any Governmental 
purpose, like the compensatory fee collected for rendering any 
service to the payers of that fee. Such compensatory fee falls within 
the expression “all other moneys” used in Article 78(2) and is to be 
credited to the Public Account, and not to the Federal Consolidated 
Fund. This view is supported by Ratilal Gandhi v. State of 
Bombay,26 wherein the provisions of Article 266 of the Indian 
                                                           
25 Para 38 of Impugned Judgment (Majority View)  
26 AIR 1953 Bom 242. C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  18  
 
Constitution that are similar to that of Article 78 were interpreted 
in the following manner: 
It is only taxes raised and revenues raised for 
Governmental purposes that form part of this fund. 
But when moneys are received as a result of fees 
imposed for a specific purpose and when the fund 
collected is earmarked and set apart, such a fund does 
not form part [of the Consolidated Fund contemplated 
under Article 266 of the Indian Constitution]. 
 
The Cess amount collected under the GIDC Act is to be credited in 
the Public Account with an entity distinct from the other revenues 
credited to it, and must be earmarked for utilization for the 
purposes specified in the GIDC Act only. No disbursement can be 
made from the Cess amount for general governmental expenditures 
or any other purpose. The Court was not assisted  on this point at 
the time of the hearing of the main case, and made the 
observations regarding deposit of the Cess amount in the Federal 
Consolidated Fund in the impugned judgment without 
appreciating  the difference between the Federal Consolidated 
Fund and the Public Account under Article 78 of the Constitution. 
The said observations are, therefore, liable to be recalled in review. 
Further it is clarified that in case the GIDC Act becomes in-
operational on failure of the Federal Government to take steps to 
commence work on the laying of the North South Gas Pipeline 
within six months, the amount of the Cess collected are liable to be 
returned and refunded to the payers.   
Discrimination 
16. The Act provides for the following maximum rates of 
cess for different Sectors:    
SECOND SCHEDULE OF THE ACT  
S.No. Sector Maximum Rate of Cess (Rs./MMBTU)  
(1) (2) (3) 
1. Fertilizer-Feed (Old)  300.00 
2. Fertilizer-Feed (New)  300.00 
3. Fertilizer-Fuel  150.00 
4. Captive Power  200.00 
5. Industry  100.00 
6. KESC/GENCO  100.00 
7. IPPs 100.00 C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  19  
 
On the question of discrimination, the impugned judgment, with 
respect, did not consider the rationale behind fixing different rates 
within different sectors but instead discussed the question of 
discrimination between the industrial/commercial consumers and 
the domestic consumers, which was not the question agitated by 
the petitioners. There appears to be no intelligible differentia  
amongst the different Industrial and Commercial gas consumers 
mentioned in the Schedule for the purposes of the GIDC Act. The 
upper limit of GIDC for the Industry, KESC/GENCO and IPPs has 
been fixed as Rs.100 per MMBTU, while remaining categories of 
gas consumers have been allowed to be charged at the rate higher 
than that. This discrimination, with respect, was overlooked in the 
impugned judgment, and thus provides a valid ground to review it. 
As per Article 25 of the Constitution which ensure equality and 
equal treatment among equals, the Federal Government cannot 
charge the Cess at the rate more than Rs.100 per MMBTU from 
any category of gas consumers. 
Principle of Res-Judicata 
17. On the ground of res-judicata, the petitioners 
vehemently  relied upon Pir Bukhsh . My learned brothers have 
distinguished that case in the impugned judgment by highlighting 
the difference of facts of that case and the facts of the present case, 
and have repelled the ground of review by quoting the observations 
made in paras 10 and 11 by them in the impugned judgment. I am 
afraid if this is the correct approach to distinguish a principle of 
law declared by a larger Bench of this Court, which is binding on 
this Bench. Pir Bukhsh  was decided by a four-member Bench of 
this Court in 1987 almost 33 years ago and still holds the field. 
The Court, in that case, elaborately discussed and expounded the 
doctrine of res judicata  and its application between the parties 
both on questions of law and fact. The Court, in that case, 
approvingly referred to a judgment of Full Bench of the Calcutta 
High Court delivered in Tarini Charan27 wherein it was held:  
To say…that the previous decision was wrong and that 
it was wrong on a point of fact, or on a pure point of 
law, and that therefore, it may be disregarded, is an 
                                                           
27 Tarini Charan v. Kedar Nuth ( A I R 1928 Cal. 777 ) C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  20  
 
indefensible form of reasoning. For this purpose, it is 
not true that a point of law is always open to a party. 
Finally, this Court in Pir Bakhsh   came to the conclusion that in a 
controversy raising a dispute inter parties, the matter adjudged is 
conclusive as between the parties both on question of fact and 
question of law. However, an exception to this principle declared by 
a larger Bench  was created in the judgment under review by 
holding that it would be difficult to apply such a principle in 
matters where a power or a right or an obligation solely depends 
upon the very legitimacy of the enactment that has come under 
challenge in a Court of law on the touchstone of the Constitution. 
It was, with respect, not appropriate for a three-member Bench to 
deviate from principle of res judicata  laid down by an earlier four-
member Bench. This Bench had two options: first, to follow the law 
declared by that Bench; or second, to refer the matter to a four-
member Bench to decide whether that opinion should be 
reconsidered by a larger Bench. As the majority did not opt for the 
second option, the principle of res judicata  as settled in Pir Bukhsh  
is fully applicable to the decree holders in the suit decided by the 
Sind High Court. 
Interpretation of  Entry No.51 of Part 1 of the Federal Legislative List 
18. The Court, in the impugned judgment while 
interpreting Entry No.51 of Part I of the Federal Legislative List 
contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution took a view28 
contrary to that of Bench of co-equal strength expressed in Durrani 
Ceramics29 by stating that “the National Assembly was fully 
competent to impose tax on natural gas through a Money Bill on 
the strength of Entry no.51 of the Federal Legislative List.” This 
                                                           
28 In  Durrani Ceramics case all items contained in Entry No.51 were read conjunctively, meaning 
thereby that Federal Government can levy tax on natural gas and mineral oil only if these sources 
of energy can be used to generate nuclear energy. It appears that no proper assistance on 
scientific lines was rendered by the law officers to this Court during the hearing of the Durrani 
Ceramics case hence the scientific fact that it was not possible to generate nuclear energy from 
mineral oil and natural gas, as these sources cannot be used as nuclear fuel was not taken into 
consideration. (Para 41 of the judgment under review) 
29 Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Petroleum & Natural Resources v. Durrani Ceramic  
   (2014 SCMR 1630 : PLD 2015 SC 354: 2014 PTD 2016)  
 C.R.P. No.421 of 2020, etc.  21  
 
finding, it is submitted with respect, is against settled principles of 
the law of precedent30 and needs to be recalled. 
Entry No.27 of Part-I of the Federal Legislative List  
19. The Federation had defended its authority to legislate 
the GIDC Act on the basis of Entry No. 2 read with Entry No. 15 of 
Part II of the Federal Legislative List in the present case, and on 
Entry No. 51 of Part I of the Federal Legislative List in Durrani 
Ceramics . It was never the case of the Federation that it has 
competence to legislate a law relating to tax or fee on natural gas 
on the basis of Entry No. 27 of Part I of the Federal Legislative List. 
Entry No.27 reads as follows: “Import and export across customs 
frontiers as defined by the Federal Government, inter-provincial 
trade and commerce, trade and commerce with foreign countries; 
standard of quality of goods to be exported out of Pakistan.” This 
entry clearly relates to trade with foreign countries (import and 
export), and inter-provincial trade and commerce, and in no way 
covers the subject of “natural gas”. The GIDC Act has not taxed or 
charged fee on the foreign or inter-provincial trade and commerce. 
It has charged fee on use of natural gas. Entry No.27, in no terms, 
justify the legislative power of the Federation to enact the GIDC 
Act. The parties were not heard on this point at the time of original 
hearing of the case; this point, therefore, escaped notice of the 
Bench, and this error appears to be apparent of the face of the 
record and is liable to be recalled. 
20. In view of the above errors that have been found 
apparent on the face of the record, the review petitions are allowed 
in the following terms:  
(i) The benefit available under the provisos to section 8(2) of 
the GIDC Act shall not be affected by the judgment under 
review.
