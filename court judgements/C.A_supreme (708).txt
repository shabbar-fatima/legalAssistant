ORDER  
 
Jawwad S. Khawaja, J . In our view,  the following untrue statements have been 
made which are not only attributab le to Mr.  Ali Zafar , ASC but are affirmed by his 
concise statement submitted and read out in Court  and the same have not been explained 
by him . The concise statement is placed on record.  
First untrue statement:  It has been categorically stated that “Hon’b le Judge Mr. Justice 
Jawwad S. Khawaja refused to accept the general adjournment of undersigned [ Mr. Ali  Zafar]”.  
This is false as is evident from the order dated 25.3.2015. To the extent, the said order 
relates to the client of Mr. Ali Zafar namely, Bahri a Town, the order states as under: - 
“Mr. Gohar Ali Khan, ASC who is representing Bahria Town (in HRC No. 
4729 -P of 2011) has pointed out that Mr. Ali Zafar, ASC is unavailable 
today because he is on general adjournment. We, however, do not appear to 
have a ny request for adjournment before us on his behalf. Then Mr. Gohar CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  2 
Ali Khan, ASC clarified that Mr. Ali Zafar, ASC is counsel in C.M.A. Nos. 
3854 and 4341 of 2014 representing Bahria Town. As we do not have any 
adjournment request and nor has learned AOR a ppeared, we could have 
proceeded in the matter in the absence of Mr. Ali Zafar, ASC, however, in 
order not to cause any prejudice to his client, let these C.M.As come up on 
31.3.2015 ”. (emphasis added)  
 
Second untrue statement:  The Court “fixed the next da te of hearing as 31.3.2015 knowing that 
the undersigned [ Mr. Ali  Zafar] is not available”.  This is an incorrect statement. The order of 
the Court dated 31.3.2015 categorically mentions as under: - 
“The order passed on 25.03.2015 shows that neither Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC was 
present nor was the learned AOR Raja Abdul Ghafoor and there was 
definitely no application for general adjournment placed before the Court on 
that date. It is only as a matter of courtesy which the Court extended to a 
member of our Bar that i nformation given by Mr. Gohar Ali Khan was noted 
in our order of 25.03.2015 to the effect that Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC was on 
general adjournment. Mr. Gohar Ali Khan, ASC did not give any indication 
as to when the general adjournment of Mr. Ali  Zafar would end . We, 
therefore, directed that in order not to prejudice the client of Mr. Ali  Zafar, 
ASC the case be adjourned to 31.03.2015 ”. (emphasis added)    
 
Third untrue statement:  It has been stated that “Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja again and again 
threatened the off icer concerned of the Government to take action against M/s Bahria Town 
otherwise his service  may be harmed” . This is untrue . Notice s to all concerned who had not 
complied with Orders of the Court, was initially issued as far back as 18.12.2013  (i.e. 16 
months ago)  in which it was said “let show cause notices to all concerned be issued requiring 
them to explain their position in this behalf” .  The show cause notices pursuant to the 
aforesaid order were issued by the Office on 11.2.2014 to all concerned incl uding Mr. 
Sajjid Zafar Dal, DCO, Rawalpindi. He has responded to the same explaining inter alia, 
that demarcation had been delayed because of transfer of certain functi onaries and on 
account of some C ourt orders. It is obvious from the show cause notice an d the reply 
thereof that neither was there a threat nor any perception of threat felt the said state CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  3 
functionary. Again notices were ordered to be issued to  19 respondents on 25.3.2015 in 
Crl. Original Petition No. 110 of 2014. Furthermore , in our order of  31.3.2015, it has been 
noted  as under: - 
“When the Court comes to the conclusion that its order which was passed 
almost two years ago and which had directed that the Collector, Rawalpindi 
shall proceed promptly  in accordance with law has not been compiled with, it 
becomes incumbent upon the Court to take action as has been done in the 
present case. Ensuring compliance of our order of 5.6.2013, two years after 
the same was passed or our chamber order of 18.12.2014 after the lapse of 
almost 16 months is neces sary for the effective enforcement and execution of 
Court orders. No person can feel threatened by the efforts made by the Court 
to ensure compliance of its orders. We may also add that the government 
functionaries, in particular Mr. Sajid Zafar, Collector  Rawalpindi was 
directed to comply with our orders. Referring to this effort on the part of the 
Court as a threat to the officer concerned, is wholly uncalled for ”.   
 
This aspect also has not bee n addressed or explained by Mr.  Ali Zafar. In fact show caus e 
notices have been issued to Government functionaries for not complying with our orders. 
All executive and judicial authorities are constitutionally obliged to implement the 
Court’s orders.  
Fourth incorrect statement:  It has been stated that the Chairman,  Bahria Town had 
“serious apprehension that the Hon’ble Judge had already made up his mind to decide the case 
against M/s Bahria Town in the absence of its counsel. …”.  This so called serious apprehension 
appears to be based on the false assertions namely,  that the Judge refused to accept the 
general adjournment of Mr. Ali  Zafar and also that the case was adjourned from 25.3.2015 
to 31.3.2015 knowing that Mr. Ali  Zafar was not available. No serious apprehension can 
be founded on the basis of a false asserti on.  
2. The above circumstances have not been explained by Mr. Ali  Zafar  although he 
was called upon to do so through our Order dated 31.3.2015 . On the contrary, he has 
reaffirmed  in his concise statement the incorrect and untrue assertions noted above . It has 
been repeated  by him that the matter was taken up on 25.3.2015 and 31.3.2015 in the CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  4 
absence of Bahria Town. This is an incorrect statement which is contrary to the record. Mr. 
Ali Zafar represents Bahria Town in CMA No. 3854/2014  and CMA No. 4341/2014 . As 
has been noted above, on 25.3.2015  these matters were not taken up and were adjourned 
to 31.3.2015. Again on 31.3.2015 these matters were not taken up  and the case was 
adjourned to 2.4.2015 . There are in fact no valid or relevant  explanations to justi fy the 
false statements made above.  
3. The above circumstances may be further confirmed and elaborated from the 
record. On 31.3.2015 we had asked Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC to explain to us certain matters 
noted in the said order which prima facie, showed that he may have been guilty of 
misconduct or of conduct unbecoming of an Advocate of this Court.  This order is to be 
read alongwith our order of 31.3.2015, wherein we asked him to submit his explanation.   
4. Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC has yesterday filed a concise state ment  (brought on record)  
setting out his explanation  which he affirmed by reading it in Court . The same is being 
taken and considered below. He has firstly referred to the fact that he had been granted 
general adjournment by Hon’ble the Chief Justice from 24.3.2015 to 1.4.2015 and that 
intimation of the general adjournment had been given to him by the office vide letter 
dated 18.3.2015. The fact that the learned counsel had been granted general adjournment 
from 24.3.2015 to 1.4.2015 or that the said adjourn ment was communicated to him on 
18.3.2015 need  not be disputed as the same have no relevance to the contents of our order 
dated 31.3.2015 and the explanations sought therein.  
5. It has next been stated that the Court was “duly informed by Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan Sr. 
ASC that Mr. Ali  Zafar ASC who is out of the country has told him that he is on general 
adjournment” . Again there is no dispute Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan not once but repeatedly 
informed the Bench that Mr. Ali  Zafar had been granted general adjournment  and also 
emphasized that Mr. Ali Zafar  had addressed a letter/application to Hon’ble the Chief 
Justice, seeking change of Bench . The relevant fact, however, is that there is no  valid  
explanation tendered by Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC  in respect of the matters noted in our  order of 
31.3.2015.   
6. Firstly, we note that Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan did not inform the Court as to the date up 
to which the general adjournment had been allowed to Mr. Ali  Zafar. In fact on 25.3.2015 
Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan was not even present in Court on behalf of Bahria Town . However,  on CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  5 
behalf of the said party Mr. Gohar Ali Khan did appear  but did not inform us of the dates 
of the adjournment  allowed to Mr. Ali Zafar . Secondly, it is also important that none was 
present on behalf of M/s Bahria Town  in the two mat ters in which Mr. Ali Zafar was 
counsel . Thirdly, the averment in para 2 of the concise statement is incomplete in material 
and significant  particulars. Although Mr. Ali  Zafar has referred to the statement made by 
Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan in respect of the general  adjournment, he has not mentioned that Mr. 
Aitzaz Ahsan on more than one occasion had stated in clear and unequivocal terms that 
Mr. Ali  Zafar had in fact moved an application before Hon’ble the Chief Justice  and that 
he had received instructions from Mr. Ali Zafar  on telephone . In fact on the Court’s 
asking, Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan supplied a copy of such letter/ application  addressed to Hon’ble 
the Chief Justice,  which was placed on the record . Mr. Ali  Zafar cannot pick one part of 
the statement made by Mr. Aitz az Ahsan while ignoring the other significant part thereof. 
There is no explanation or justification for this tactic of  pick and cho ose.  
7. In the concise statement once again it has been stated that “notwithstanding repeated 
information provided by Hon’b le members of the Bar about the general adjournment granted to 
Mr. Ali  Zafar the case was taken up on both occasions in the absence of Bahria Town”  i.e. on 
25.3.2015 and 31.3.2015. The implication of this averment is as if the Bench had done 
something extr aordinary and unusual. It may be mentioned that when the ca se was taken 
up on 25.3.2015 no body appeared for Bahria Town in CMA 3854 and 4341 of 2014 
although Raja Abdul Ghafoor was AOR and Mr. Ali  Zafar was ASC in the said matters. 
Only Mr. Gohar Ali Khan ASC appeared in HRC No.4729 -P of 2011 in which he was 
representing Bahria Town. Mr. Gohar Ali Khan had also informed the Bench that he was 
not representing Bahria Town in CMA 3654 and 4341 of 2014 and that Mr. Ali  Zafar was 
counsel for Bahria Town in the s aid matters. Mr. Gohar Ali Khan did not  inform the 
Bench as to when the general adjournment of Mr. Ali  Zafar was to end. The professional 
duty of an Advocate is that he is supposed to appear in Court when a case is called. On 
25.3.2015 Mr. Ali  Zafar m ay ha ve been unavailable but even Raja Abdul Ghafoor AOR 
was not present to give any information to the Court . It is in these circumstances that we 
noted in our order that “we could have proceeded in the matter in the absence of Mr. Ali  Zafar, 
ASC. However, in order not to cause prejudice to his client, let these CMAs come up on 
31.3.2015” . Here we may also point out that it is always for the AOR to appear if the ASC CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  6 
is unavailable and it is for the AOR to give intimation to the Court if adjournment has 
been granted to counsel. It is established  from the record that this has not happened. Yet 
this failing on the part of counsel/AOR is being portrayed as if the Court did something 
extraordinarily unusual, odd or abnormal.  The explanation (if it can be called one) is 
devoid of merit and is thus rejected.   
8. It may also be added that in the concise statement Mr. Ali  Zafar has made an 
averment to the effect as if it was the duty of the Court to obtain information as to general 
adjournment from the Office. To put it mildly this is a very strange statement . It is not at 
all the duty of the Court to perform duties which AORs/ASCs are duty bond to perform.  
This submission is wholly untenable.  
9. Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC has also mentioned that “issuance of directions against t he party to 
litigation without its la wyer is also against the principles of due process, fair trial and access to 
justice” . We do not see how this general statement can be applied to the circumstances of 
the case, noted above. If ASC and AOR are not presen t when the case is called it is for the 
Court to proceed in the matter  or if considered appropriate, to adjourn the case as was 
done to accommodate Mr. Ali  Zafar and his client Bahria Town .  
10. Further statements have been made in the concise statement fi led by Mr. Ali  Zafar, 
which are inconsistent and contradictory  and do not offer any valid explanation . The 
application filed in Court has been annexed to the concise statement. It has been signed by 
Raja Abdul Ghafoor AOR and purports to have been drawn an d settled by Raja Abdul 
Khaliq Khan, ASC for and on behalf of Mr. Ali  Zafar. The office objections  to the said 
application  have also been filed.  Additionally, the contents of the application to the Chief 
Justice and the application  to the Court  are acknowl edged by Mr. Ali  Zafar as being 
verbatim copies in all material particulars. Furthermore, the categorical and repeated 
statements made by Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan Sr. ASC in Court are clear that the letter addressed 
to Hon’ble the Chief Justice which appear s to ha ve found its way to the press was made 
out and printed on the letter head of M andviwalla & Zafar Advocates  (Mr. Ali  Zafar’s 
Law Firm)  and was signed on behalf of Mr. Ali  Zafar. The same is the position of the 
application filed by Mr. Ali  Zafar a copy of wh ich is appended with his concise statement. 
It reproduces scurrilous and false assertions which have been mentioned in para 8 of the 
aforesaid letter addressed to Hon’ble the Chief Justice  and in the application . The CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  7 
application again has been signed “for and on behalf of Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC”  and also bears 
the signatures of Raja Abdul Ghafoor, AOR.  
11. Coming next to the question of alleged bias of one of us (Jawwad S. Khawaja, J.) 
against M/s Bahria Town, it has been explained by Mr. Ali  Zafar that it is a n 
apprehension of Malik Riaz Hussain, Chairman of Bahria Town. However, there is no 
valid basis for such apprehension  which is wholly unfounded  considering that the two 
matters (CMAs 3654 and 4341 of 2014) have been dealt with in the usual course and in th e 
usual manner  extending indulgence and accommodation to Mr. Ali Zafar and his client . 
Not every subjective opinion  of a litigant  can be given credence.  It is for Advocates to 
inform their clients as to the legal position.  The case law in our jurisdictions  as well as in 
other common law jurisdictions is clear that the perception of bias should be reasonable 
and objective. In the case titled Gen ® Parvez Musharraf vs. Nadeem Ahmed Advocate  (PLD 
2014 S C 585), it was observed  that “Courts are required to proce ed on the basis of 
objective/rational standards and not on the basis of unfounded subjective opinions or on the basis of 
assumed perceptions of bias which may border  on paranoia.”  In any event, as noted above, even 
the subjective perception of bias is foun ded on false assumptions.   
12. We have noted the submissions and averments made in the concise statement filed 
by Mr. Ali  Zafar but the same d o not contain any valid and satisfactory explanation on 
issues in respect of which we had asked for explanations .  
13. The unprofessional  and irresponsible  assertions made in the application/letter to 
Hon’ble the Chief Justice have remained un answered and un explained  in all  material 
particulars even if we are to accept that the letter/application was somehow given to the 
press by the office  of the Court . There is explicit and implicit acknowledgement in para 8 
of the concise statement filed by Mr. Ali Zafar that the letter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice 
and the application filed in Court  were not only within his knowl edge but had also been 
made by him or with his concurrence. We can accept his submission that he was abroad 
and, therefore, “is personally  not aware of the publication [in the press] and hence not 
responsi ble”. However, the  very fact that he made inquiries  from his offices at Islamabad 
and Lahore about such publication and had asked “if anyone of them supplied the copy of the 
CMA/application to the press and got a categorical negative answer” . It has also been asserted 
in para 8 of the concise statement tha t “it may be noted that the CMA which was returned was CMA No.3854/14 in SMC 3/09  8 
exactly the same as the application filed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice”.  These submissions  that 
the letter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice and the concise statement, today filed in Court, 
leave no roo m for doubt that untrue assertions noted in our order of 31.3.2015 have been 
made by Mr. Ali Zafar.     
14. Since there is no valid explanation forthcoming from Mr. Ali  Zafar, ASC in respect 
of the issues which have been highlighted  above and  in our order of 31.3.2015, we are 
inclined to the view that  Mr. Ali  Zafar has been guilty of misconduct and conduct 
unbecoming of an Advocate. The dignity and high standing of the legal profession and of 
Judges and Courts has to be defended for the sake of the independ ence of the Judiciary 
and Bar and for the effective administration of justice. This has to be done, if necessary, 
especially in the face of misconduct or conduct which is unbecoming of an Advocate. 
Such conduct must be curbed if the honour and dignity of t he Bar and Bench are to be 
preserved.  We, therefore, issue notice to Mr. Ali Zafar to show cause why action 
envisaged under Order IV Rule 30 of the Supreme Court Rules (including 
suspension/removal from practice) be not taken against him.
