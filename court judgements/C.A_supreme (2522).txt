whether examination -in-chief of Gen.(R) Naseer Ullah Khan Human Rights Case No.19 of 1996  
 4 
Babar and Lt. Gen.(R) Asad Durrani was recorded ; according to 
the report , no such document is available  on record . However, 
Mr. Salman Akram Raja, learned ASC, appearing for the 
petitioner , states that they were subjected to cross -examination 
on the affidavits, whic h have already been filed. As these 
proceedings were drawn in camera , therefore, the same be sealed 
and are handed over to Mr. Rafaqat Hussain for depositing the 
same with the Registrar. As regards proceedings drawn by the 
office of Registrar to locate the se documents, the same are also 
made part of the record and are ordered to be deposited with the 
Registrar.  
 
6.  In pursuance of order dated 29.02.2012, Mr. Younas 
Habib,  Ex-Chief  of Ex -Mehran Bank Limited, has appeared and 
stated that earlier at the time  when the proceedings were 
conducted in this case no statement was filed by him. It seems 
that might be he had filed or given statement before the 
investigating agencies under Section 161, Cr.PC in connection 
with some criminal cases against him, as refere nce of the same is 
available at page 220 of the file.  However, today he has placed on 
record a handwritten statement/affidavit, which was not sworn 
on oath, although such statement or affidavit is required to be 
sworn under Supreme Court Rules, 1980 . It seems that as he is a 
sick person and attend ing the Court on Wheelchair, therefore, we 
accept the affidavit and direct the office to manage attestation of 
the same, which has been done.

7.  Initially , Mr. Younas Habib claimed that the affidavit  
filed by hi m be considered as a classified document.  However, o n 
having gone through the same we are of the opinion that it does 
not fall within the category of the documents, in respect whereof 
privilege could be claimed, thus the same is declared not to be the 
classified one. He has read out the contents of the affidavit  in 
Court and also handed over three copies of the same along with a 
photograph wherein he has been shown to be one of the persons 
along with the then President of Pakistan Ghulam Ishaq Khan  
(Late)  and uniformed officer of Pakistan Army having 
conversation with Mirza Aslam Baig, Ex -Chief of Army Staff. The
