JUDGMENT  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ. - Constituti on 
Petition s No.20 of 2013 as well as a Human Rights Case have been 
initiated under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973.  Const.P.20/13 etc.  3
2.  Precisely stating facts of the case are  that a news item was 
published in the “Daily Times” d ated 14.04.2013 in which it was 
reported that Raja Parvaiz Ashraf,  the then  Prime Minister , ten days 
after having completed his tenure doled out billions of rupees in the 
form of development funds. According to the report, amongst the 
beneficiaries were Sy ed Yousaf Raza Gillani, Ali Musa Gillani, Abdul 
Qadir Gillani, Moonis Elahi, Ch.  Shujaat Hussain, Ch.  Parvez El ahi, 
Wajahat Hussain, Sh. Waqas  Akram, Sherazi family of Sindh  and 
others . The report claims that official documents reveal that around 
Rs.2.5 bi llion were transferred by Raja Parvaiz Ashraf to be spent  in 
Gujjar Khan,  his ancestral  constituency.  The office put up a note, 
highlighting the above news item, upon which following order was 
passed: - 
“In the first instance information be called about th e news from 
the Chief Editor and Reporter of Daily Times. Similarly, the 
Principal Secretary to Prime Minister and Secretary Ministry of 
Finance shall submit reports to the Registrar of this Court. Put 
up Reports before Registrar for 15 -04-2013”  
 
3.  In co mpliance with the above reproduced order, three 
letters  were received  on 15.04.2013 . In the letter received from 
Ministry of Finance duly singed by Mr. Mansab Khan Awan, Joint 
Secretary M/o Finance it was stated  that an amount of Rs.22 Billion 
was allocate d for People’s Works Program -II (PWP -II) during financial 
year 2012 -2013 for development schemes identified by the 
Parliamentarians and notables under demand No.109 -Development 
Expenditure of Cabinet Division. Subsequently , on the direction of PM 
Secretari at, an additional amount of Rs.25 billion was allocated to the 
Cabinet Division’s Demand No.109 -Developme nt Expenditure of the Const.P.20/13 etc.  4
Cabinet Division for P WP-II. As such , the total allocation under the said 
program  for the year 2 013-2014 comes to Rs.47 billion . It is asserted  
further that the releases , out of P WP-II, are made by the Cabinet 
Division on the d irections of the PM Secretariat and that  the Finance 
Division through its Financial Advisor (Cabinet) only endorses the 
sanction letters issued by the Cabinet  Division, after approval by the 
Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) i.e. Secretary Cabinet. It has been 
further stated that neither the Cabinet Division issued any sanction 
letter for release of funds under P WP-II nor d id the Finance Division 
endorse  any s uch sanction after 15 .03.2013.  
4.  Mr. Tahir Maqsood, Additional Secretary (P -I) submitted a 
letter on behalf of PM Secretariat stating therein that no funds were 
released for development scheme s under PWP -II after dissolution of 
the National Assembly i.e . 16.03.2013. He further stated that the 
exact amount of funds  were issued against the names appearing in the 
news clipping out of PWP -II during the current financial year , under 
the directives of Prime Minster and prior to dissolution of National 
Assembly  was annexed with the letter.  
5.  Mr. Rashid Rehman, Chief Editor, Daily Times , also sent a 
letter  in which he stated that the news clipping was a mere 
reproduction of publication and broadcast already made public by 
“Dunya ” Newspaper and Satellite TV Cha nnel. The original source of 
news clipping in question are the column, story and talk on a number 
of shows by Mr. Rauf Klasra of Dunya Newspaper & Satellite TV 
Channel. He has further stated that the Monitoring Desk of Daily Times 
had been following the is sue, and the very same was taken from Mr. 
Klasra’s re velations . Const.P.20/13 etc.  5
6.  The matter was put up in Chambers on 16.04.2013, when 
the following order was passed: - 
“A careful perusal of information collected from concerned 
quarters reveals that former Prime Ministe r Raja Perv aiz Ashraf 
spent/allocated/distributed various amounts. A sum of Rs.22.0 
billion was allocated for People’s Works Programme -II during 
financial year 2012 -2013 for development schemes identified by 
Parliamentarians and Notables under Demand No.10 9-
Development expenditure of Cabinet Division. Furthermore, an 
amount of Rs.25 billions on the directions of the Prime Minister’s 
Secretariat, was allocated to the Cabinet Division’s Demand 
No.109 -Development Expenditure of Cabinet Division for 
People’s Wo rks Programme -II, break up of which is as follows: - 
 
S.No.  Amount  
Released  Date  Remarks  
1. 5 billion  06.11.2012  
Though Adjustment in PSDP 
2012-13 
2. 5 billion  23.11.213  
Though Adjustment in PSDP 
2012-13 
3. 5 billion  28.12.2013  
Though Adjustment in PSDP

4. 5 billion  10.01.2013  
Through Supplementary Grant  
5. 3 billion  07.03.2013  
Through Supplementary Grant  
6. 2 billion  12.03.2013  
Through Supplementary Grant  
Thus, the total amount of aforesaid two allocations under 
People’s Works Programme -II for the year 2013 -14 comes to 
Rs.47.0 billion(Rs.22.0 billion + Rs.25 billion).  
Above amounts have not only been distributed /allocated to 
elected representatives including MNAs, MPAs but also to 
notables. There are a lot of speculations about the distributi on 
of above amounts by the Prime Minister, prima facie, beyond his 
budgetary as well as discretionary powers.  
Therefore, instant proceedings be registered as petition under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution and be fixed in Court on 
17.04.2013 as it gives  rise to a question of public importance, 
involving enforcement of fundamental rights of the citizens Const.P.20/13 etc.  6
guaranteed  under Articles 9, 14, 19 A, 24 and 25 of the 
Constitution.  
Notices to Secretary Cabinet and Secretary Finance, 
Government of Pakistan be issued  with direction to appear and 
explain: - 
(i) As to whether the funds belonging to public exchequer 
have been allocated/distributed to MNAs/MPAs/Notables 
in accordance with the Constitution and the law?  
(ii) What is the phenomenon or procedure to monitor the  
spending of amount and as to whether the details of such 
developments are available?  
(iii) Whether the contracts were granted to the contractors by 
following the PPRA Rules?  
 
7.  The matter was , thus,  registered as Constitution Petition 
No.20 of 2013  and was fixed in Court on 19.06.2013. In pursuance of 
the order dated 16.04.2013, the Secretary ; Cabinet Division, 
Government of Pakistan, filed requisite reply through CMA No.2222 of 
2013.  
8.  It would be appropriate to note hereinbelow the extract of 
origin al budget and supplementary additional amounts released as well 
as balance of remaining budget of PWP -II for the year 2012, 2013.

10.  Besides above schemes, another scheme was added for 
construction at Mandra -Chakwal Road and Sohawa -Chakwal Road in 
the PSDP 2012 -2013 vide Prime Minister’s directive dated 02.08.2012 
and 31.08.201 2. These schemes were accorded anticipatory approval 
for Rs.2675.955 and Rs.3300.00 Million respectively on 08.09.2012 
vide Cabinet Divisi on’s U.O dated 8.09.2012. Accordingly funds 
amounting to Rs.2301.00 million and Rs.3675.00 Million were released 
to Pak PWD on 02.10.2012 & 16.03.2013 respectively. However the 
Prime Minister’s Secretariat vide their order dated 2.10.2012 
transferred funds  as well as the execution of said development project 
from Pak.  PWD to National Logistic Cell (NLC). It is pertinent to point 
out that Islamabad High Court Islamabad has suspended the operation 
of the order dated 2.10.2012 under its order dated 10.10.2012 but 
inspite of said order, the said amount of funds i.e. Rs.5976 Million Const.P.20/13 etc.  10 
were transferred to M/s NLC vide Cheque Nos. B0837/B 836966 dated 
15.10.2012 for Rs.1.100 billion and B08502/B85 50167 dated 
30.01.2013 for Rs.1.201 billion and Cheque No.B08534/B85 3331 
dated 16.3.2013 for Rs.3.675 billion for execution of works by them. 
However, the aforesaid last cheque dated 16.3.2013 amounting to 
Rs.3.675 billion was not cleared by the Federal treasury, Islamabad 
due to the said Court order. Now these funds amountin g to Rs.3.675 
Million were surrendered to Government vide Pak. PWD, letter dated 
14.5.2 -2013. However, the same was not returned to Pak. PWD by 
NLC despite repeated reminders.  The Revised PC -I amounting to 
Rs.4671.337 Million and Rs.4789.404 Million in res pect of said 
schemes were prepared by the National Logistic Cell (NLC). However, 
revised approval of these schemes have not so far been accorded by 
the competent forum i.e. ENCEC.  In compliance of the directions 
contained in the Islamabad High Court Islama bad’s order dated 
28.03.2013 under which the transfer of work/funds to M/s NLC was 
declared illegal, M/s NLC were asked to return the funds amounting to 
Rs.2.301 billion to Pak. PWD, which have not been returned by them 
on the plea that they have filed an Intra Court Appeal in the Islamabad 
High Court, Islamabad against the Order of the Honorable Court as 
intimated by them vide their letter No.27201/MCSRP/P&A/NLC dated 
26.04.2013.

15.  Besides above no tables and MPAs, the re are numerous 
others of the identical status to whom funds from PWP -II were 
released. Details of which are available in the Audit Reports. But, no 
one has pointed out that what were  the grounds for which Notables 
and MPAs were obliged  by the Prime Minister. Similarly , a good 
number of MNAs and Senators who are entitled to identify the 
schemes under PWP -I, were also obliged from PWP -II as well.  
18.  This Court , vide order dated 19.07.2013, directed the 
Accountant General Pakistan Revenue (AGPR)  to ensure that pending 
decision of the matter, the funds which had already been released to 
the Executing Agencies, including for the schemes enumerated in the 
list appended with the letter dated 15.04.2013, referred to 
hereinabove, were not furt her distributed and the payments in respect 
of the schemes, details of which had been furnished by the Prime Const.P.20/13 etc.  14 
Minister’s Secretariat would be stopped immediately . A compliance 
report was also sought to be furnished within a period of three days. 
Similarly, the Executing Agencies, to whom the work had been 
assigned or the process of assigning of work was yet to be completed, 
were directed not to pro ceed further with those schemes  till further 
orders.  
19.   In view of the facts, which have been examined curso rily, 
it was deemed appropriate for conducting special audit of P WP-II, for 
which the funds have been released in the year 2012 -13 or onward, 
keeping in view the categories of the schemes. In pursuance of the 
directions of the Court dated 21.05.2013, Speci al Audit was conducted  
and c oncise statement on behalf of Auditor General of Pakistan was 
filed, which pertains to the audit of  following 
Ministry/Division/Department : - 
(i) Ministry of Housing & Works  (Pakistan  Public Works 
Department ). 
(ii) Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources 
(SNGPL/SSGC)  
(iii) Ministry of Water & Power (WAPDA)   
(iv) Government of Punjab (Public Works and Local

20.  The material brought on record persuades the  Court  to 
infer that a criterion  must have been  laid down for allocat ion of funds 
for scheme s under PWP -II and the Parliamentarians, Member s of the 
Provincial Assemblies, functionaries/officers/officials , Notables and 
other persons  who received such amounts in the name of development 
schemes  are not required to enrich themselves from such funds ; 
therefore, o n 28.06.2013 , following directions  were issued :-  
(i) Notice be issued to the former Prime Minister Raja Pervez 
Ashraf, whose name is appearing in the list of recipients of 
funds from PWP -II for development works in the Constituency 
from where he was elected as Member of the National Assembly 
with a view to providing him an opportunity of hearing in the 
matter;   
(ii) Notices to all other beneficiaries of funds of PWP -II including the 
Parliamentarians, Members of the Provincial Assemblies, Const.P.20/13 etc.  16 
Notab les, etc., be also issued after obtaining the list from Malik 
Manzoor Akhter, DG, Audit. The latter is also required to effect 
service upon all of them at their addresses separately through 
the executing agencies, details of which are available in CMA 
No.3974/2013 furnished by him;   
(iii) To ensure service upon all concerned, complete list of the 
beneficiaries including theirs names and details of the funds 
allocated to them be uploaded on the website of Supreme Court 
of Pakistan ( www.supremecourt.gov.pk ), enabling them to 
respond to the notices and put forward their viewpoint/defence, 
if they so desire;   
(iv) Notices be also issued to Pak PWD, SNGPL, PEPCO as well as the 
Chief Secretaries of all the Provinces to effect service upon all 
the executing agenc ies which allegedly executed the works, 
after having collected the details from the office of DG, Audit in 
respect of the schemes executed at the Federal and Provincial 
levels. The representatives of the Chief Secretaries may, if need 
be, collect the relev ant information from the office of DG, Audit;   
(v) The executive agencies, both Federal and Provincial, shall also 
submit the details of the status/ performance/completion or 
otherwise of the development schemes, which have been 
executed out of the funds allocated for the purpose, enabling 
this Court to pass appropriate orders;  
(vi) The executing agencies shall not release funds to the 
contractors/persons etc., who were deputed to execute such 
development works, etc., nor these funds shall be considered t o 
have been lapsed on account of the close of Financial Year as it 
has already been ordered on 24.06.2013, pending decision of 
the case;  
(vii) It is stated that the idea of allocating funds to the 
Parliamentarians, etc. was introduced by late Dr. Mehboob -ul-
Haq, a renowned Economist of his times when Members of the 
Parliament were elected in non -party elections. Such 
recommendations/report, if available, be submitted by the 
Planning Commission for our perusal and a copy thereof be also 
supplied to the lear ned Attorney General; and   
(viii) The Secretaries Finance and the Economic Affairs Divisions and 
all other concerned are directed to provide assistance to the 
learned Attorney General for Pakistan, so that he may assist the 
Court in a befitting manner.    
 
21.   In response to the notices, M/s Maula Bux Chandio former 
Law Minister,  Senator Mushahid Hussain, Ghias Mela MNA, Anwar Ali 
Cheema MNA, Liaqat Ali Shabab MPA, Muhammad Hamayat Khan MPA, 
syed Muhammad Ali Shah MPA appeared either in person or through  
their counsel and put forward their respective explanations/replies , Const.P.20/13 etc.  17 
whereas majority of the recipients did not opt  to come forward and  
contest proceedings , despite service in the manner noted above .  
22.  Thereafter, a ll the above titled cases and Consti tution 
Petition No.115 of 2012 were taken up together  and were disposed of 
by common short order dated 22.07.2013. However, in the case of 
Abdul Raheem Ziaratwal  v. Federation of Pakistan  (Constitution 
Petition No.115/2012) , separate reasons have been reco rded for sake 
of convenience.  
23.  Before proceeding further it is important to note that to 
attend one of the questions noted in order dated 28.06.20132, 
namely, “ it is stated that idea of allocating funds to the 
Parliamentarians etc. was introduced by l ate Dr. Mehboob -ul-Haq a 
renowned Economist of his times  when Members of the Parliament  
were elected  in non -party electio ns, such recommendations/report , if 
available, be submitted by the Planning Commission for our perusal 
and a copy thereof be also suppl ied to the learned Attorney General ”, 
the learned Attorney General while submitting CMA 4495/13, on behalf 
of Economic Affairs Division stated that, “ it is not within the Division’s 
purview to deal with the disbursement/releases of development funds 
to the  executing agencies as it deals with the matter pertaining to 
external assistance from the foreign governments and multilateral 
agencies .” However, it is pointed out by the learned Attorney General 
that the “Special Local Government Programme” was renamed after 
1988, and since then the nomenclature of the same kept on changing 
depending on the Government in power. Since the expenditure was 
being charged to the Development Budget, the programme remained a Const.P.20/13 etc.  18 
component of PSDP. The Historical allocations for the se programs have 
been shown by reproducing a table, which reads as under: - 
Period  Name of Program  Allocation  
(Rs. in Million)  
1985-1988 Special Local Government 
Program  3,300.000  
1988-1991 &  
 1994-1997 Peoples Works Program  16,200.000  
1991-93 &  
1998-2000 Tameer -e-Watan Program  9,700.000  
2002-2005 Tameer -e-Pakistan Program  7,353.727  
 Total  36,553.727  
 
Importantly, this summary also finds mentioned, with reference to the 
Planning Commission about the result or impact of schemes executed 
under PWP -I and PWP -II that no impact evaluation of PWP -II has been 
carried out so far.  
24.   It is quite surprising that aforesaid programme 
continuously being followed from 1985 to onward but up to the year of 
2013 its impact has not been  evaluated , which was necess ary in the 
interest of general public for the reasons that, if on the one hand the 
tax payers’ money is being spent through PWP -II for the welfare of the 
society, the executive government must know about its impact as 
without its impact what is the justifi cation/necessity to spend annually 
hundreds of thousands in the name of Development Programmes. A 
perusal of table reproduced above, also indicates that the names of 
these programmes had been changing in different eras depending 
upon the regime of differen t political parties.  
25.   It may be noted that such like schemes are not applicable 
in our country alone as identical programmes have been introduced in 
India by the name of “Members of Parliament Local Areas Const.P.20/13 etc.  19 
Development Scheme” in the year of 1993 and Gu idelines have also 
been issued, according to which the general public approach the 
Members of the Parliament for providing certain basic facilities 
including the community infrastructure in the area and according to 
these guidelines, the Members of Lok Sab ha can recommend works for 
their respective constituencies. Elected Members of the Rajya Sabha 
can recommend for implementation of work for one or more districts 
as they may choose in their States of elections anywhere in the 
country. Under the guidelines there is a comprehensive mechanism to 
monitor the execution and implementation of the schemes. Similarly, 
such programme has also been introduced in various countries i.e. 
India, Kenya, Malaysia, Philippine, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, etc. In 
Kenya, the type s of projects that may be funded from the 
development fund are clearly define d in policy or law, while in some 
other countries including Sudan and Malaysia, there is no restriction on 
choice of such projects.  In India, as long as some basic guidelines are 
followed, the choice of projects is entirely at the discretion of individual 
legislators; however, local administrative authorities are responsible 
for implementing the chosen projects. In Kenya and Uganda, 
committees constituted by legislators make the de cisions. In Tanzania 
the composition of committees is prescribed by law but the legislator 
chairs his or her constituency’s committee.  In most of the countries, 
development fund spending is usually subject to the regular national 
auditing processes. Audit reports may be reviewed by the legislature, 
and in some cases the law requires that information about projects 
and their implementation be made public. In countries with access to Const.P.20/13 etc.  20 
information legislation there is generally greater transparency and, 
therefo re, greater accountability for the use of CDF money.  
26.   It is to be noted that on 10.12.2002 and 7.02.2003 the 
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development circulated a well 
defined course of action for smooth implementation of the Programme, 
contents whereof are reproduced hereinbelow: - 
Formalities for the Special Local Development Programmed:  
(i) On receipt of the schemes (suggested) by the Parliamentarians 
(as detailed on a prescribed proforma) from the Ministry of Local 
Government & Rural Develop ment the concerned Ministry shall 
get the feasibility / cost estimates / PC -I prepared from its 
executing department and accord Administrative Approval to the 
schemes as per procedure in vogue.  
(ii) Then return the approved scheme to the Ministry of Local 
Government & Rural Development within 20 days of its receipt.  
(iii) The Ministry of Local Government & Rural Development shall 
release funds to the concerned Ministry / Department within 7 
days of the receipt of approved scheme, for implementation.  
(iv) Total cost of s chemes selected for each constituency must not 
exceed the allocation of funds to each MNA. This is to ensure 
that work taken in hand will be completed within the allotted 
funds.  
(v) Each executing department/agency will follow its codal 
formalities for execut ion of the schemes for ensuring 
transparency.  
27.   Above formulations were applicable both on PWP -I and 
PWP-II. However, it may be noted that according to the plea, which 
has been placed on record by the government of Pakistan  Cabinet 
Division through CMA 2222/13 , after passing of 18th Constitutional 
Amendment , in pursuance whereof the subject of Local Government Const.P.20/13 etc.  21 
and Rural Development has been transferred to Provincial 
Government, therefore, this Programme was assigned to the Cabinet 
Division in December,  2010 and according to the prevailing practice, 
the Prime Minister ’s directives are followed by priority lists issued to 
Cabinet Division for release of certain funds for development schemes 
identified by the Parliamentarians and other notables. The Cabine t 
Division prepares the sanction letter and submits its findings to the 
Finance Division (FA Office) for approval/endorsement. After 
approval/endorsement of Finance Division, sanction letter is issued to 
AGPR as well as to the relevant executing agencies e .g. PWP, SNGPL, 
SSGPL, Ba lochistan Development Authority, etc., ipso fecto . The AGPR 
releases the funds to the assignment accounts of the relevant 
executing agency.  
The responsibility to ensure the transparent release of these funds in 
accordance with the  PEPRA rules rests with executing agency and their 
administrative Ministries/Divisions, Provincial Government and such 
conditions are clearly mentioned in the sanctioned letter.  
28.   It would be appropriate to note that according to order 
passed by the P rime Minister for release of the funds under People ’s 
Works Programme -II during financial year, 2012 -13 it has been left at 
the discretion of the executing agency to use funds in accordance with 
their departmental procedure/rules by fulfilling the codal/le gal 
formalities. Unfortunately, nothing has been done to follow the PEPRA 
Rules. It seems that for such reasons in the Special Audit Report, 
contents whereof have been reproduced hereinabove, it has been 
observed that without  prior feasibility study/ report  or following PEPRA Const.P.20/13 etc.  22 
Rules, amount allocated by the executive agencies has been used, 
essentially in a non -transparent manner. One can understand at a 
glance after going through the detail of the scheme s, which has been 
reproduced hereinabove from the audit  report that PEPRA rules were 
not followed in all the schemes i.e. 6963.  
29.  On 16.07.2013 learned Attorney General  for Pakistan, M/s 
Wasim Sajjad, Iftkhar Hussain Gillani, Khawaja Haris Ahmed and Asif 
Fasihuddin Vardag, learned senior counsel, formulate d the following 
questions for determination by this Court:  - 
(1) Whether the National Assembly can assent to a grant which is to 
be utilized by the Executive at its discretion? If the answer is in 
the affirmative, whether such discretionary grant can be spent 
at the absolute discretion of the Executive or is the discretion to 
be exercised in a structured manner?  
(2) Whether or not the Constitution permits the use/allocation of 
funds to MNAs/MPAs/Notables at the sole discretion of the Prime 
Minister or the Chief Mi nister? If yes, what has been or should 
be the procedure/criteria for governing allocation of such funds 
for this purpose?  
(3) Whether such funds can be provided by way of supplementary 
grant?  
(4) Whether such funds can be allocated by way of reappropriation?  
(5) Whether a bulk grant can be made in the budget without giving 
detailed estimates under each grant divided into items and that 
every item has to be specified?  
(6) That if the amounts as approved in the budget passed by the 
National Assembly are utilized within th e permissible limits of 
the budget, whether such expenditures are justified?  
 
30.  It is to be noted that Article s 80 to  84 of the Constitution 
deal with the Budget and Supplementary Grants.  For reference, said 
Articles are reproduced herein below: - 
80. Annual Budget Statement . (1) The Federal Government 
shall, in respect of every financial year, cause to be laid before the 
National Assembly a statement of the estimated receipts and 
expenditure of the Federal Government for that year, in this Part 
referred  to as the Annual Budget Statement.  
(2) The Annual Budget Statement shall show separately - Const.P.20/13 etc.  23 
(a) the sums required to meet expenditure described by the 
Constitution as expenditure charged upon the Federal 
Consolidated Fund; and  
(b) the sums required to meet other expenditure proposed to be 
made from the Federal Consolidated Fund; and shall distinguish 
expenditure on revenue account from other expenditure . 
 
81. Expenditure charged upon Federal Consolidated Fund.  
The following expenditure shall be expenditure c harged upon the

to- 
(i) the Judges of the Supreme Court  and the Islamabad 
High Court;  
(ii) the Chief Election Commis sioner;  
(iii) the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman;  
(iv) the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the National 
Assembly;  
(v) the Auditor -General;  
(b) the administrative expenses, including the remuneration

(c) all debt charges for which the Federal Government is liable,

(d) any sums requir ed to satisfy any judgment, decree or award 
against Pakistan by any court or tribunal; and  
(e) any other sums declared by the Constitution or by Act of  Majlis -
e-Shoora (Parliament)  to be so charged.  
 
                  82.  Procedure relating to Annual Budg et Statement.  
 (1) So much of the Annual Budget Statement as relates to 
expenditure charged upon the Federal Consolidated Fund may be 
discussed in, but shall not be submitted to the vote of, the National 
Assembly.  
  
 (2) So much of the Annual Budget Stat ement as relates to other 
expenditure shall be submitted to the National Assembly in the form 
of demands for grants, and the Assembly shall have power to assent 
to, or to refuse to assent to, any demand, or to assent to any demand 
subject to a reduction of  the amount specified therein;  
Provided  that, for a period of ten years from the commencing day or 
the holding of the second general election to the National Assembly, 
whichever occurs later, a demand shall be deemed to have been 
assented to without any re duction of the amount specified therein, 
unless, by the votes of a majority of the total membership of the 
Assembly, it is refused or assented to subject to a reduction of the 
amount specified therein.  
  
 No demand for a grant shall be made except on the  recommendation 
of the Federal Government.  
  
 
 
 83.   Authentication of schedule of authorised expenditure.  
 (1) The Prime Minister shall authenticate by his signature a 
schedule specifying - 
(a) the grants made or deemed to have been made by the Nationa l Const.P.20/13 etc.  24 
Assembly under Article 82, and  
(b) the several sums required to meet the expenditure charged 
upon the Federal Consolidated Fund but not exceeding, in the 
case of any sum, the sum shown in the statement previously 
laid before the National Assembly.  
 
  
 (2) The schedule so authenticated shall be laid before the National 
Assembly, but shall not be open to discussion or vote thereon.  
  
 (3) Subject to the Constitution, no expenditure from the Federal 
Consolidated Fund shall be deemed to be duly authoris ed unless it is 
specified in the schedule so authenticated and such schedule is laid 
before the National Assembly as required by clause (2).  
 
 
 
    84. Supplementary and excess grants.  
If in respect of any financial year it is found - 
(a) that the amoun t authorized to be expended for a particular service 
for the current financial year is insufficient, or that a need has 
arisen for expenditure upon some new service not included in the 
Annual Budget Statement for that year; or  
(b) that any money has been spent on any service during a financial 
year in excess of the amount granted for that service for that year;  
the Federal Government shall have power to authorize expenditure 
from the Federal Consolidated Fund, whether the expenditure is 
charged by the Con stitution upon that Fund or not, and shall cause to 
be laid before the National Assembly a Supplementary Budget 
Statement or, as the case may be, an Excess Budget Statement, 
setting out the amount of that expenditure, and the provisions of 
Articles 80 to 8 3 shall apply to those statements as they apply to the 
Annual Budget Statement.  
31.  A plain reading of the aforenoted provision of the 
Constitution makes it abundantly clear that although in terms of Article 
84 of the Constitution the Federal Govern ment has the power to 
authorize  the expenditure to meet the contingency noted therein, 
however, it is obligat ory upon the Federal Government to lay before 
the Nation Assembly the supplementary Budget Statement so that it is 
subjected to the same scrutiny and pr ocedure as is applicable to the 
Annual Budget Statement in terms of Article s 80 to 83 ibid. it is to be 
noted that t here is nothing in Article 84 ibid, which suggest s that such 
a Supplementary Budget Statement shall only be placed before the 
National Assem bly at the time of consideration of the Budget for the 
next financial year rather the use of the word “and” before the word Const.P.20/13 etc.  25 
“shall” as well as use of the phrase “Supplementary Budget 
Statement” makes it abundantly clear that the supplementary Budget 
Statem ent, in the normal course, is to be placed before the National 
Assembly during the currency of the same financial year, if the Federal 
Government has decided to authorize  such expenditure. Since the 
provisions of Article 84 of the Constitution make the pro visions of 
Article 80 to 83 specifically applicable to the Supplementary Budget 
Statement as well, the incurring of expenditure by the Federal 
Government without going through the procedure provided in Article s 
82 and 83 of the Constitution would be tantam ount to nullifying the 
said provisions of the Constitution.  
32.  So far as the question , as to whether the Constitution 
provides for the Prime Minister exercising any discretionary powers in 
the matter of supplementary and excess grants , etc., is concerne d, it 
is to be noted that there is no such provision in the Constitution which 
confers any such discretionary power on the Prime Minister. Contrary 
to it , with regard to supplementary grants, it is the Federal 
Government which has the power to authori ze expenditure from the 
Federal Consolidated Fund. As per Article 90 of the Constitution, the 
Federal Government includes the Prime Minister and the Federal 
Ministers. The said Article stipulates that the executive authority of the 
Federation shall be exercised  in the name of the President by the 
Federal Government, consisting of the Prime Minister and Federal 
Ministers.  
33.  The Article 97 of the Constitution deals with the extent of 
executive authority of the  Federation . It provides that s ubject to the Const.P.20/13 etc.  26 
Consti tution, the executive authority of the Federation shall extend to 
the matters with respect to which  Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament)  has 
power to make laws, including exercise of rights, authority and 
jurisdiction in and in relation to areas outside Pakistan , provided  that 
the said authority shall not  extend in any Province to a matter with 
respect to which the Provincial Assembly has also power to make laws.  
Similarly, Article 129 ibid stipulates that the executive authority of the 
Province shall be exercised in the name of the Governor by the 
Provincial Government, consisting of the Chief Minister and the 
Provincial Minister which shall act through the Chief Minister.  
Reference may also be made to Article 164 ibid, which apparently 
extend s the executive author ity of the Federatio n or a Province to 
make grants for a purpose which may not be one with respect to which 
Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament) or as the case may be, the Provincial 
Assembly may make laws. However, t his provision is to be read with 
Article 97 ibid insofar as executive authority vested in the Federation 
or the Province is concerned. Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that 
here too , it is th e Federation or the Province , which is authorized to 
make the grants referred to therein and not the Prime Mi nister o r the 
Chief Minister , as the case may be, on his own.  
34.  Now the question arises as to whether, and if so, what is 
the criterion laid down by the law for allocation, sanctioning and 
disbursement of supplementary grants and monitoring of works th at 
may be undertaken pursuant thereto.  In this regard  reference may be 
made to Article 78 ibid which provides that all revenues received, all 
loans raised and all moneys received by the Federal Government in the 
repayment of any loan shall form part of a c onsolidated fund to be Const.P.20/13 etc.  27 
known as the Federal Consolidated  Fund, while all other moneys 
received by or on behalf of the Federal Government , or received by or 
deposited with Supreme Court or any other court established under 
the authority of Federal Governmen t, shall be credited to the Public  
Account of the Federation. Whereas, Article 79 ibid stipulates that the 
custody of the Federal Consolidated Fund, the payments of the money 
into that Fund, the withdrawal of moneys there from, the custody of 
other moneys received by or on behalf of the Federal Government, 
their payment into, an d withdrawal from, the Public Account of the 
Federation, and all matters connected with and ancillary to the matters 
aforesaid, shall be re gulated by the Act of Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament) or until provis ion in that behalf is so made, by rules made 
by the President.  Apparently, there is no Act of Majlis -e-Shoora  
enacted in terms of Article 79 of the Constitution.  However, there are 
GFR, which though were issued pre -independence but c ontinued to be 
operative by virtue of Indian Independence Act, 1947 and later were 
adapted by means of Article 268 of the Constitution of 1973. 
Paragraph 1 of Chapter -I of the G FR provides that “ the rules contained 
in this volume, which are essentially exe cutive orders of the President 
describe primarily  the financial powers of different authorities 
subordinate to the Federal Government and the procedure prescribed 
by the President which should be followed by them in the securing and 
spending of the funds n ecessary for the discharge of the functions 
entrusted to them. Departmental authorities should follow these rules, 
if any, continued in their departmental regulations and other special 
orders applicable to them ”.  Const.P.20/13 etc.  28 
35.  Rule 2(vii) of GFR defines “Controlli ng Officer” to mean a 
head of a department or other departmental officer who is entrusted 
with the responsibility of controlling the incurring of expenditure and 
or the collection of revenue by the authorities subordinate to the 
department.  Rule 2(viii) ibid provides that a ll revenues received by the 
Federal Government all loans raised by that Government an all  money 
received by it in repayment of any loan shall from part of a 
consolidated fund to be  known as the Federal Consolidated Fund.  All 
other money  received by or on behalf of the Federal Government; or  
received by or deposited with the Supreme Court or any other court 
established under the authority of the Federation;  shall be credited to 
the Public Account of the Federation . Similarly, rule 2(xviii) ibid defines 
“re-appropriation”  to mean the transfer of funds from one unit of 
appropriation to another such unit.  The Standards of Financial 
Propriety expected to be observed by every public officer in the matter 
of expenditure and payment of moneys, are provided in rule 10  of 
GFR. The said rule mandates, inter alia that “every public officer is 
expected to exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure 
incurred from public moneys as a person of ordinary prudence would 
exercise in respect of expendi ture of his own money” and that “public 
money should not be utilized for the benefit of a particular person or 
section of a community unless the amount of expenditure involved is 
insignificant, or a claim of the amount can be enforced by the court of 
law, or the expenditure is in pursuance of a recognized policy or 
custom” .  
36.  It is to be noted that t he principles governing the 
Standards of Financial Propriety to be observed by the public officers Const.P.20/13 etc.  29 
associated with the various Ministries/Divisions, Attache d Departments 
and Subordinate Offices of the Government, generally as also with 
respect to matters pertaining to Supplementary Grants and Re -
Appropriation, are also provided in the System of Financial Control and 
Budgeting introduced by the Finance Divisio n, Government of Pakistan , 
Islamabad through an Office Memorandum dated 13.09.2006 . in terms 
of para 3 of the said Memorandum, the predominant onus to observe 
these standards of finical propriety rest squarely on the shoulders of 
the Principle Accounting O fficer of the Ministry/Division, etc.  Similarly, 
the Rules of Business, 1973 provide that the Secretary of the 
concerned Ministry/Division/Department shall be its Principal 
Accounting Officer, and “shall ensure that the funds controlled by him 
are spent in  accordance with the rules laid down by the Finance 
Division”. It is in this manner that the provisions of the aforenoted 
System of Financial Control and Budgetary mandatorily apply to him. 
As regards the duties and responsibilities of the Principal Accoun ting 
Officer  and Financial Advisor , same are enumerated in para s 4 and 9  of 
the said Memorandum . Amongst the responsibilities and duties of 
Financial Advisor and Deputy Financial Advisor , in respect of 
Ministries/Divisions to which they are attached , include Proposal for 
Supplementary Grant in respect of Unexpected Expenditure, which are 
to be dealt with by the Financial Advisor concerned as per the 
instructions contained in Annexure -II to the said Office memorandum 
and re -appropriation of funds, as set out  in Annexure -I of the Office  
Memorandum.  
37.  It is of significance to note that para 2 of the Annexure -II 
stipulates that “the request for a supplementary grant should be made Const.P.20/13 etc.  30 
in a summary to be signed by the Principle Accounting Officer ”. The 
summary should contain the information as indicated in the enclosed 
Performa. It is also noteworthy that the information solicited in 
appendix to Annexure -II requires , inter alia , that the detailed 
information offering reasons for the demands for supplementary grant s 
must includ e reasons why provisions were not made in the original 
budget, reasons as to why the proposed expenditure can be postponed 
to a subsequent year, and the detailed justification of the proposal.  
38.  Reference in this behalf may also be made to rules 94 to 
96 of GFR which deal  with the principles governing surrender of 
anticipated savings , rules 99 to 101 which deal with the principles and 
procedure governing re -appropriation of funds , and rules 102 to 104 
which govern Supplementary Grants. Rule 104 ibid stipulates 
“expenditure on a new service, in the technical sense, and on new 
items, such as, new buildings new roads, etc. for which no provision 
exists in the budget, may be incurred in the middle of the year only in 
exceptional cases”.  The said rule, in unequivocal terms , assert s that 
the Government is indisposed on general principles to admit  such 
demands in the course of year. In case, however, the necessity to 
incur such expenditure is urgent, the administrative department 
should explain clear ly why it was not provided for in the original 
budget and it cannot be postponed for consideration in connection with 
the next budget , and that the c ases which involved the supplementary 
grant will normally be accepted by the Ministry of Finance only if th ey 
relate to the matters of real imperative necessity, or to the earning or 
safe-guarding the revenue. In such cases the demand for 
supplementary grant, or for a token grant in respect of a new service if Const.P.20/13 etc.  31 
the expenditure can be met by re -appropriation, wil l be presented to 
the legislature as soon as practicable  after the need arise.  
39.  Reference may also be made to the Assembly Debates of 
the National Assembly of Pakistan held on Thursday, March 22, 1973 
with respect to Article 87 of the Draft Constituti on at pages 1787 to 
1793 (culminating in a brief summing -up of rationale for the provisions 
of Article 84 by Dr. Mobashar Hassan, the then Finance Minister) , 
where from it is evident that  the wisdom of the framers of the 
Constitution was that moneys by way of supplementary grants would 
only be provided in exceptional circumstances . It is pertinent to 
mention that in the concluding paragraph of his debate, Dr. Mobashar 
Hassan, has referred to the Parliamentary Practice in other counties to 
apparently represen t that the supplementary budgetary statements 
prepared in terms of Article 84 ibid are to be laid before the national 
Assembly in the Budget Session of the following year. It may be also 
be noted that in terms of Article 84 ibid such a course may be 
permis sible, but it is not imperative. In this  regard  reference may be 
made to rule 104 of the GFR as  well as  rule 197 of the Rules of the 
Procedure, 2007 . In fact, rule 197 indicate s that in the case of 
supplementary grants, the assent of the National Assembly is to be 
obtained before these funds are made available.  
40.  With regard to question  as to whether or not the 
Constitution permits the use/allocation of funds to 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables at the sole discretion of the Prime Minister or the 
Chief Minister; i f ye s, what has been or should be the 
procedure/criteria for governing allocation of such funds for this 
purpose , it is to be noted that  under the Constitution there is no Const.P.20/13 etc.  32 
provision whatsoever that permits to use allocation of funds at the 
discretion of the pr ime Minster/Chief Minster.  However, as discussed 
hereinabove, with regard to supplementary grants, the Federal 
Government , which includes the Prime Minister and the Ministers,  has 
the power to authorized expenditure from the Federal Consolidated 
Fund. Further, t here is also no provision in the Constitution that 
mandates use/allocation of funds to MNAs/MPAs or Notables. Infect , 
the very use of the term ‘Notables’ is abhorrent to the Islamic ethos , 
both Holy Quran and Last sermon (Khutba) of the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PUBH) , which envisages that all distinctions on basis of 
caste, race and colour stand abolished, and the only distinction which 
remains is that of piety.  
41.  Article 80 of the Constitution provides for the Annual 
Budget Statement whereby, for e ach financial year the Federal 
Government is required to cause to be laid before the National 
assembly a statement of the estimated receipt and expenditure of the 
Federal Government for that year. This Statement, insofar as 
expenditure is concerned, is req uired to show separately funds 
required to meet expenditure charged upon the Federal Consolidate d 
Fund and  funds required to meet ‘other expenditure’ proposed to be 
made form the federal Consolidated Fund. While Clause (2) of Article 
82 of the Constitution  stipulates that so much of the Annual Budget 
Statement as relates to ‘‘other expenditure’’ shall be submitted to the 
National Assembly in the form of demands for grants, and the 
Assembly shall have power to assent to, or to refuse to assent to, any 
demand , or to assent to any demand subject to a reduction of the 
amount specified therein . Significantly , Clause (3) of Article 82 Const.P.20/13 etc.  33 
specifically mandates that “n o demand for a grant shall be made 
except on the recommendation of the Federal Government ”. As to how 
a demand for the grant is to be made is provided , inter alia , in rule 
183 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in National 
Assembly, 2007, which reads as under:  - 
“183. Demands for grants : (1) A separate demand shall 
be made in respect of the grant proposed for each Ministry 
or Division:  
Provided that the Government may cause to be included in 
one demand, grant proposed for two or more Ministries or 
Divisions or a demand to be made in respect of 
expenditure, which cannot readily be classified u nder a 
particular Ministry or Division.  
(2) Each demand shall contain a statement of the total 
grant proposed and a statement of the detailed estimate 
under each grant divided into items.”   
42.  The above referred r ule shows that each demand for a 
grant sh ould contain ‘‘details of estimate’’ and, furthermore, the 
demand should also show ‘‘the various items comprising the subject of 
the grant’’. In other words, item-wise estimate of the grant is required 
to be placed before the National Assembly for discussi on in terms of 
rule 186 ibid. When the above -cited rules are read in juxta position 
with rules 186 to 193 and especially rule 194 ibid, it become quite 
evident that discussion and voting on the demands for grants in the 
Budget cannot take place unless the details of each grant in terms of 
its items -wise estimate is included the demand. It is to be noted that 
these rules are made under Article 67 of the Constitution and, as such, 
have the status of law deriving direct mandate form the constitution.  Const.P.20/13 etc.  34 
43.  The above analysis of the provisions of the Constitution 
read with the Rules of Procedure , 2007  clearly indicate that qua “other 
expenditures ” there is no provision which mandates the demand for 
block allocation of funds , inasmuch as , under the rules each dema nd is 
required to give items -wise detail . Importantly , if the Budget 
Statement includes demand for grant for use/allocation of funds to 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables, it would necessarily b e a demand for block 
allocation, as it involves request for placing at the dis posal of the 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables a Certain sum of money as grant to be utilized 
by or at their request as and when they may identify the schemes of 
development required for their constituency. Such a demand, if 
included in the budget, appears to be contrary  to the constitutional 
provisions , which require that each expenditure to be specified with 
sufficient particularity , in the Annual Budget Statement, so that it can 
be considered and voted upon by the National Assembly. Besides, it is 
also in derogation of  rules framed by the National Assembly which 
require demand for each grant to be specified alongwith detailed 
estimates items -wise.  
44.  As regards the question whether any such discretionary 
funds can be placed at the disposal of the Prime Minister /Chief  
Ministers for use of /allocation to the MNAs/MPAs/Notables, neither the 
Constitution provides for the same nor the Rules of Procedure indicate 
that such a course for demanding a grant from the National Assembly 
is open to the Prime Minister. In  fact, if an y discretionary funds are 
allowed to be placed at the disposal of the Prime Minister by the 
National Assembly in the Annual Budget Statement, it shall be ultra Const.P.20/13 etc.  35 
virus the provisions of the Constitution in the same manner as in the 
case of MNAs,/ MPAs/Notable s, discussed in the previous paragraph.  
45.  It is pertinent to mention here that the very propose of 
preparing the Annual Budget Statement is to know and apprise the 
National Assembly beforehand as to what expenditure is to be incurred 
during the ensuing  financial year and the precise purpose/schemes 
insofar as development fund is concerned to which such expenditure 
relates. For that matter, to leave or earmark  any amount of money to 
be used/ allocated at some subsequent stage during the financial year 
at the discretion of th e Prime Minister/Chief Minister  is also repugnant 
to the very concept and connotation of the Annual Budget Statement.  
46.  In fact, expenditure envisaged to be incurred under t he 
Constitution is not “person  specific ”, rather it is “grant specific ”, that is 
to say, the Constitution envisages provisions of funds for expenditure 
to be specified in the Annual Budget Statement vis -à-vis ‘‘Schemes for 
Development’’ and not for placing these funds in the hands of any 
person (be the Prime Mini ster or MNA/MPA/Notable or any other) for 
purpose of expending as per his whim s and wishes .  
47.  In this regard it is to be noted that a policy or practice may 
have been adopted by the parliamentarians to place funds in the 
hands of the Prime Minister to be used/allocated at his discretion to 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables. However, if any such policy/practice is in 
existence, it too is repugnant to the aforenoted provisions of the 
Constitution.      
48.  It is, however, another matter if prior to the preparation of 
the Annual Budget Statement the MNAs/MPAs/ NGOs and/ or any other Const.P.20/13 etc.  36 
person from the constituencies throughout the country are called upon 
to identify schemes or expenditure that may be required for effecting 
necessary development in their area of concern. Such an exercise, 
however, will have to be across the board , irrespective of the political 
party or parties (when there is coalition) that may be in power. 
Moreover, it shall be carried out much before the preparation of the 
Annual Budget Statement so that if  the relevant scheme or 
expenditure is to be included in the Annual Budget Statement, it would 
have passed through the process of due consideration by the Planning 
Commission for purposes of ascertaining its necessity and efficacy and 
conducting its appraisa l, technical analys is, feasibility and economic 
cost before it is included as a demand for grant in the Annual Budget 
Statement. However, there is no constitutional provision which permit s 
inclusion of any such scheme  or expenditure at the  behest or any 
MNA/MPA/Notable/ any other person during the currency of a financial 
year, unless it is necessitated by a totally unforeseen contingency 
arising out of extraordinary circumstances which needs to be met on 
urgent basis.  
49.  As far as the question that since there is no specific 
prohibition in the Constitution qua  allocat ion of funds to 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables etc. hence the same is permissible , is concerned , 
it is to be noted that the language employed in the above referred 
provisions of the Constitution i.e. Arti cles 80 to 84 ibid, implicitly 
excludes such person -specific allocations.  
50.  So far as the actual exercise of discretionary powers, if 
any, of the Prime Minister are concerned, even if they be presumed to Const.P.20/13 etc.  37 
exist, they cannot be exercised for personal or for parochial benefit, 
rather the y are to be exercised in the light of his oath as incorporated 
in the Third Schedule to the Constitution  as well as Article 38, which 
mandates the State to promote social and economic well being of all 
the people/citizens o f Pakistan and no just any segment or community 
thereof.   
51.  so far as the question if the amounts as approved in the 
budget passed by the National Assembly are utilized within the permissible 
limits of the budget, whether such expenditures are justifie d, it is to be noted 
that in the light of the declaration  made hereinabove  that funds cannot be 
placed at the sol e discretion of Prime Minister/C hief Minister as the 
expenditure envisaged to be incurred under t he Constitution is grant 
specific and not pers on specific,  the allocation of funds for development 
schemes has to be made following the procedure provided in Articles 80 to 
84 of the Constitution and the rules/instructions noted hereinabove.  
52.  For the foregoing reasons it is held as under: -   
       
(1) The National Assembly , while giving assent to a grant which is 
to be utilized by the Executive at its discretion , has to follow the 
procedure provided in Articles 80 to 84 of the Constitution as 
well as the Rules of Procedure, 2007.  However, such 
discretionary grant can not be spent at the absolute discretion 
of the Executive and the discretion has to be ex ercised in a 
structured manner;  
(2) The Constitution does not permit the use/allocation of funds to 
MNAs/MPAs/Notables at the sole discretion of the Prim e Minister 
or the Chief Minister . If there is any practice of allocation of 
funds to the MNAs/MPAs/Notables at the sole discretion of the 
Prime Minister /Chief Minister , the same is illegal and 
unconstitutional. The government is bound to establish  
procedur e/criteria for governing allocation of such funds for this 
purpose ;  Const.P.20/13 etc.  38 
(3) Though funds can be provided for development schemes by way 
of supplementary grant  but for that purpose procedure provided 
in Articles 80 to 84 of the Constitution and the rules/instructi ons 
noted hereinabove has to be followed strictly ;  
(4) Funds can be allocated by way of re -appropriation but the 
procedure provided in the Constitution and the rules has to be 
followed in its true perspective;    
(5) No bulk grant can be made in the budget withou t giving detailed 
estimates under each grant divided into items and that every 
item has to be specified?  
(6) The amounts as approved in the budget passed by the National 
Assembly  have to be utilized for the purpose specified in the 
budget statement. Any re -appropriation of funds or their 
utilization for some other purpose, though  within the permissible 
limits of the budget, are not justified . In such circumstances, 
the supplementary budget statement has to be place before the 
parliament following the procedure provided in Articles 80 to 84 
of the Constitution and the rules/instructions noted hereinabove.

hereinabove.
