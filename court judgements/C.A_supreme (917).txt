JUDGMENT  
  Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J: -  Through this petition  
for leave to appeal , filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 , the petitioner has 
assailed the judgment dated 28.02.2023 passed by the High 
Court of Sindh, Karachi, whereby his Constitutional Petition 
No.S-1067 of 2019 was dismissed.  
2.  Succinctly, facts of the case leading to filing of this 
petition are that the respondent, Pervaiz Ahmed , being owner of 
the premises in question initiated proceedings for fixation of fair 
rent against his tenant/petitioner, Akhtar Kamran  (predecessor -in-Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 2 - 
   interest of the petitioners ), by filing a rent case bearing No.367/2010 
on 18.10.2010 under Section 8 of the Sindh  Rented Premises 
Ordinance, 1979  (the Ordinance)  before the Rent Controller, 
Karachi (East) . It was the case of the respondent that the 
petitioner is his tenant in respect of shop No.4, ground floor, 
Khayam Chambers situated on Plot No.190/A -1, Block No.2,  
PECHS Society, Karachi. It was alleged that after lapse of 
several years , the rate of inflation was substantially increased 
which affected the economic norms and conditions and , 
therefore , the maintenance of the prop erty became expensive, 
however the peti tioner is paying the rent at the rate of 
Rs.11,401/ - per month , which is less as compared to the 
prevailing rent at the adjoining locality of the area . The 
petitioner was asked verbally as well as through legal notice 
dated 20.10.2010 for increasing the re nt, but he fail ed to do so.   
After due deliberations, the application of the respondent was 
allowed by the Rent Controller and fair rent was fixed  as 
Rs.70,000/ - per month from the date of institution of the 
application with 10% per annum increase in futur e vide 
judgment dated 15.09.2015. Aggrieved of the above, the 
petitioner filed FRA No.132 of 2015  before VIIIth Additional 
District Judge, Karachi (East),  which was allowed and the case 
was remanded to the Rent Controller for decision afresh  vide 
judgment dated 18.08.2018 . Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 3 - 
   3.   After remand of the case, IIIrd Rent Controller , 
Karachi (East) vide judgment dated 07.09.2018 , after hearing 
both the parties,  fixed the rent of the premises in question at 
Rs.97,974. 47 per month with 10% per annum further increase . 
The p etitioner preferred FRA No.151/2018 before IIIrd 
Additional District Judge, Karachi (East) which was dismissed  
through the judgment dated 06.08.201 9. The petitioner invoked 
the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court of Sindh, 
Karachi by filin g Constitutional Petition No. S -1067 of 2019 , 
which too met the fate of dismissal vide judgment dated 
28.02.2023 , hence this petition.  
4.    The learned counsel for the petitioner states that the 
High Court of Sindh has not taken into consideration the fac ts 
and circumstances of the case in its true perspective; that the 
lease agreement executed  with the respondent was 
unregistered , thus was not admissible in evidence; that the 
impugned judgment is suffering from misreading and non-
reading of evide nce and while fixing the rent, the  Rent 
Controller has not taken into consideration the rent agreement 
of the adjoining premises which have lesser rent than the 
premises in question . In support of his contentions, reliance is 
placed to the cases reported as  Zahee r Ahmad  versus  
Government of Sindh and another  (1999 MLD 2881) , 
Muhammd Farooq M. Memon  versus  Government of Sind 
through its Chief Secretary, Karachi  (1986 CLC 1408) , Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 4 -

5.   We have considered the submissions of the learned 
counsel for the petitioner at length and perused the material 
available on the record  with his able assistance .  Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 5 - 
   6.   The language of Section 8 of the Ordinance , prima 
facie,  requires th e Rent Controller to consider all the ingredients 
mentioned therein. It provides complete mechanism and 
procedure for determining fair rent , which for ease of reference  
is reproduced hereunder :- 
“(1) The Controller shall, on application by the tenant or 
landlord determine fair rent of the premises after taking 
into consideration the following factors: - 
 
a) the rent of similar premises situated in the similar 
circumstances, in the same adjoining locality.  
 
b) the rise in cost of construction and repair charges.  
 
c) the imposition of new taxes, if any, after 
commencement of the tenancy; and  
 
d) the annual value of the premises, if any, on which 
property tax is levied.  
 
  (2)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”  
 
In the case reported as State Life In surance Corporation of 
Pakistan and another  versus Messers British Head and 
Footwear Store and others  (2018 SCMR 581) , this Court 
while dealing with the proposition of fair rent observed as 
under: - 
“In the instant case the appellant out of four factors, as  
provided under section 8 of the Ordinance, 1979, 
according to record have proved the last three. As to the 
fourth factor, as provided in clause (a), we find sufficient 
evidence produced by the landlord to prove the rent of 
similar premises situated in the  similar circumstances, in 
the same or adjoining locality which was not accepted by 
the Courts below and in our opinion this is the only 
controversy where the evidence adduced by the respective 
parties in terms of the leave granting order need to be re -Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 6 - 
   examined. At this juncture we would like to reiterate that by 
now it has been settled by this Court that it is not necessary 
for a landlord to prove hike in respect of all four factors as 
detailed in section 8 of the Ordinance, 1979, or that all 
four factors must co -exist in each and every case seeking 
fixation of fair rent. In fact the prime factor has always 
been the prevalent market rent of the similar premises 
situated in similar circumstances, in the same or adjoining 
locality and in the instant case all the Courts below have 
totally ignored the evidence produced by the landlord to 
prove this factor primarily on the ground that the evidence 
produced by the landlord though was in respect of similar 
premises situated in similar circumstances , in the same 
locality but the building in which the premises was situated 
was relatively a new one and secondly, that the parties had 
agreed for a lump sum rent instead of per square feet and 
therefore, increase claimed in rent on the basis of per 
square feet could not be  allowed.  
 
  In our opinion the restraint exercised by the Court 
below from fixing fair rent on per square feet basis for the 
reason that the parties had agreed to a rent on lump sum 
basis totally appears to be misplaced, suffice is to observe 
that determi nation of fair rent is the sole domain of the 
Rent Controller and even an agreement between the parties 
barring each other from approaching the Rent Controller 
for getting fixation of fair rent cannot operate as a bar to 
the jurisdiction of the Rent Contro ller of fixing fair rent. 
Reference can readily be made to the case of Tarig All 
Bagar v. New Goodwill Computers  (2011. SCMR 554). On 
the same principle the agreement between the parties for 
payment of lump sum rent cannot be a clog on the powers 
of the Re nt Controller to fix fair rent on square feet basis , 
in accordance with the prevailing norms and to ensure that 
the fair rent so determined is in consonance with the 
quantum of rent of similar premises situated in similar 
circumstances in the same or adjoi ning locality.”  
 
 Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 7 - 
   7.  We have minutely gone through the pleadings of the 
parties and scanned the documents/evidence available on the 
record. It refle cts that the relationship of the petitioner and the 
respondent is not denied. The rise in cost of construct ion, repair 
charges, taxes etc. has been increased and labour charges have 
also been enhanced which fact need not to be proved through 
documentary evidence  and the same also cannot be ignored 
while determining the fair rent. Though the 
respondent/ applicant  has produced original tenancy agreement 
(Exh.A/3 ) executed in 2006 between the respondent/landlord and 
M/s Universal Network System Private Limited in the same building 
in respect of shop No.5 admeasuring 480 square feet and the 
rent of the said premises was Rs.63 ,160/- which  comes to 
Rs.131.58 per square feet  whereas the petitioner has submitted 
the tenancy agreements of shop of other buildings situated in 
Block-6. It is noted that the rate of shop No.5 was Rs.63,160/ - 
and was enhanced to Rs.84,950/ - per month from 01.11.2009 
as per revised tenancy agreement dated 29.09.2006.  Hence, the 
trial Court fixed the fair rent of shop No.4 , subject matter of the 
petition, on the basis of calculation at the rate of Rs.131.58 per 
square feet. As per calculation, the fair rent of the subject shop 
comes to 744.6 x 131.58 = 97 ,974.47 .  When the 
respondent/landlord filed Rent case No.367/2010 in October, 
2010 in respect of the subject shop before the Rent Controller 
the tenant of shop No.5 in the same building was paying the Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 8 - 
   rent of smaller shop than the shop in question in the same 
building at the rate of Rs.84,950/ - per month.    
8.   Moreover, as per time honour principle, while 
determining the fair rent , the Court is required to take into 
consideration all ingredients , which are reducing the value of 
money with each passing month. The premises in question is 
situated at Block-2, Khayam Chambers, PECH S Society , 
Karachi , whereas other shops to which the petitioner has made 
reference are not of the same building ,  thus cann ot be taken 
into consideration  while determining the fair rent .  
9.  We find that IIIrd Rent Controller, Karachi vide 
judgment dated 07.09.2018 has rightly determined the fair rent 
of the premises in question which (decision)  was maintained upto 
the High C ourt and we are in complete agreement with the 
same. There are concurrent findings of all the fora below which 
cannot be interfered with unless those are perverse, arbitrary, 
capricious or fanciful. No misreading and non -reading has been 
noticed.  
10.   Regarding judgments /case law, cited at the bar  by 
the learned counsel for the petitioner , the same are 
distinguishable to the facts and circumstances of the instant 
case. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to 
make out a case for interferenc e in the instant jurisdiction.  Civil Petition No.492 -K of 2023.doc  - 9 - 
   11.     For what has been discussed above , the petition 
being devoid of merit is dismissed and leave to appeal is 
declined.
