ORDER  
 
THE CASE OF SHEIKH ZAYAD HOSPITAL  
  Mr. Babar Hayat Tarar, Secretary Health, Government 
of Punjab submits that the Provincial Government reiterates its 
undertaki ng to ensure that the autonomous status of the Shaikh 
Zayad Hospital would not be compromised rather the same shall 
be retained; that the Provincial Government has sen t a Reference 
to the Federal Government to reconstitute the Board of Trustees of 
the Shai kh Zayad Bin Sultan An -Nahyan Trust and adds that the 
apprehension of the Members of the Faculty of Shaikh Zayad 
Hospital that the salary structure is likely to be adversely affected 
is misconceived. On Court query, he submits that the Provincial 
Governmen t by way of interim arrangement had constituted a S.M.C. NO. 1 OF 2012 & C.M.A. NOs. 49 -L/2012, 448 -L/2012, 4055/2012, 5186/2012, 926 -L 
OF 2013 & H.R.C. NO. 8634 -S OF 2012  2 
Managing Committee comprising of eight members and is headed 
by Mr. Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Finance and the last 
meeting of the said Committee took place in March, 2013. The 
other Members of the Com mittee, according to him, are renowned 
public figures, Government Servants  and two representatives / 
Faculty Members  from Shaikh Zayad Hospital.  
2.  We would not like to comment any further on the 
working of the Shaikh Zayad Hospital and the grievances be ing 
agitated by Members of the Faculty in CMA No. 682 -L/2013. 
However, the very fact that the Managing Committee did not have a 
meeting for the last more than nine months may not be a flattering 
commentary on the working of the institution. The Court was 
inclined to constitute a committee / commission by way of an 
interim arrangement to oversee the working of the Institution and 
to ensure that the above undertaking of the Provincial Government 
is given effect to in letter and spirit. However, on the assuran ce 
held out by the Secretary Health before this Court that the matter 
would shortly be resolved and the Reference sent to the Federal 
Government would lead to a more permanent arrangement, we 
adjourn the case for a date to be fixed by the office in the 2nd week 
of January, 2013.  
 
THE CASE OF EFROZ CHEMICALS  
3.  Learned counsel for the Efroz Chemicals submits that 
petitioner is prepared to pay compensation to each bereaved family 
in terms of CMA No. 1624 -L/2013. However, he adds that in 
deference to the obse rvation of this Court, petitioner is prepared to 
increase the amount of compensation to the tune of Rs.400,000/ - 
to each bereaved family provided the State drops the prosecution of S.M.C. NO. 1 OF 2012 & C.M.A. NOs. 49 -L/2012, 448 -L/2012, 4055/2012, 5186/2012, 926 -L 
OF 2013 & H.R.C. NO. 8634 -S OF 2012  3 
the criminal cases registered qua the occurrence; requests for 
three days t ime to seek instructions as to how soon the afore -
referred compensation can be paid to the families.  
4.  Let notice be issued to the Prosecutor General Punjab 
as also to the Advocate General Punjab to appear after examining 
the matter and seeking instructi ons from the Competent Authority. 
To come up on 30.12.2013.
