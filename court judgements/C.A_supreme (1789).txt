Raja Aamir Abbas, learned ASC stated that Chairman NEPRA  
(Mr. Justice (Retd .) Ahmed Khan Lashari) has tendered 
resignation on 2nd June, 2013 , but he is  not aware as to whether 
the same has been accepted or not.  
2.  Khawaja Muhammad Asif, petitioner, appeared in 
person and stated that the order dated 22.05.2013  has not been 
complied with in letter and spirit inasmuch as the Caretaker 
Government without l awful authority terminated the services of Const.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc  - 3 - 
 some of those officers who were already working and performing 
their duties in Finance Division and I.T. , either as Advisors or on 
contract.  As duly elected government is likely to take over within 
a day or so an d budget i s likely to be prepared shortly, therefore, 
due to unlawful action of Caretake r Government concerned 
Divisions a re facing a lot of difficulties.  He has further stated that  
about more than 100 officers have been sent on deputation to 
different or ganizations from the Province of Balochistan after 22nd 
May, 2013 without adhering to the rules and regulations knowing 
well that the orders relating to the policy making cannot be 
passed by the Caretaker Government.  
3.  Similarly , Mr. Tariq A sad, learned ASC stated that 
services of some of the doctors who were holding contractual 
posts in the Federal Government Services Hospital (Poly Clinic) 
Islamabad , have also been terminated and t here are so many 
such like examples , on the basis of which disturbance ha s been 
created.   
4.  Since all these  issues are important in nature, 
therefore, we direct to the Secretaries, Establishment, Cabinet, 
Health, Water & Power , Finance  Division (s) and all other 
concerned Departments/Corporation s to file lists of the officers  :- 
(a)  who were appointed against any post, by the 
Caretaker Government after taking over including 
Chairmen etc of the Corporations whose list finds 
mention in the order dated 22.05.2013;  
 
(b) whose services were acquired on  deputation f rom 
different or ganizations on different positions in the Const.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc  - 4 - 
 Departments and Corporations controlled by the 
Federal Government;  
 
(c) whose services were terminated because they were 
holding different positions on contract basis in all the 
Government Departments/Hospitals;  
 
(d) Whose transfers have been made contrary to the 
Judgment of Anita Turab’s case etc;  
 
(e) Deputationists brought to Federal Government 
Departments from the Province of Balochistan . 
 
5.  In the meanwhile all above orders of termination/  
transfer/posting or  deputation etc., shall remain suspended till
