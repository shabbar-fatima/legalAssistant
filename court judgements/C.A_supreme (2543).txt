ORDER  
For the reasons to be recorded later, the delay in filing both the appeals is condoned . 
Both the appeals are partially allowed to the extent that if the proceedings have already 
been initiated by the Supreme Judicial Council  (‘SJC’) against a Judge , same shall not 
abate  on his resignation or retirement , as the case may be,  during such proceedings . It 
is the prerogative of the SJC to proceed with the matter  accordingly.  The impugned 
judgment is modified to that extent. This order is with the majority of four by one 
disagreeing (Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.) on the point of limitation as well as on merit s.
