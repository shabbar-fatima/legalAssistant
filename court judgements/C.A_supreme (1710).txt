     ORDER  
Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC appearing in  
Const.P.31/2011  has drawn our attention towards the para 1 of 
the order dated 4.7.2011, which is reproduced herein below :- 
“Mr. Ishtiaq Ahmed, Secretary, Election Commission of Pakistan 
stated that: - 
(i) In view of the report of NADRA following categories of 
unverified voters have been removed from the database of 
NADRA: - 
Category of unverified Voters  Voters 
Count  
Voters wi thout any Identity Number  15,028,808  
Voters with Invalid CNIC  2,140,015  
Voters with Duplicate CNIC entries  2,491,090  
Voters  with Duplicate M NIC entries  6,469,310  
Voters with MNIC not registered with 
NADRA  11,056,775  
Total Unverified  Voters:  37,185 ,998 
 
 (ii) In the place of above removed voters, 36 million voters have been 
entered into the database and verification of both t he categories is to be 
carried ou t by visiting/approaching the house of each voter by the 
representative of the Election comm ission d oor to door. This exercise 
shall commence from 18th of July, 2011  and is likely to be completed on 
16th of August, 2011. He added that further procedure of 
publishing/displaying these lists shall be carried out according to law and 
in this respect,  a comprehensive plan has already been chalked out, copy 
of which has been placed on record. According to him, the whole process 
is likely to be completed by 16th of December, 2011 and thereafter the lists 
shall be handed over to NADRA for scanning and pri nting;  
 
(iii) As far as objection of the learned counsel for the  petitioner about 
pasting photographs of the voters is concerned, the Secretary explained 
that it has been decided that the photographs of the voters available with 
the NADRA shall be pasted o n the copy of the electoral list, which shall be 
available with the Presiding Officer only at the time of polling for security 
reasons and to protect privacy of voter;  
 
(iv) In respect of the objection with regard to showing permanent 
address of the voters , the Secretary explained that in this behalf a 
proforma has been prepared allowing the voter to e xercise his/her option 
of vote either at the permanent place of residence or where he/she is Const. P No.31 -2011 etc  - 3 - 
temporarily residing because of his/her place of job, etc. The op tion 
he/she opts to exercise, shall be printed in the voters’ list;  
 
(v) The Election Commission of Pakistan  shall ensure that a person 
can ex ercise his right to franchise only at one place so to avoid 
duplication  either by himself or by proxy, etc;  
 
(vi) The S ecretary also informed that the Election Commission of 
Pakistan  has in principle decided that electronic voting machine shall be 
used in future. However, after deliberations and taking into confidence all 
the stake holders, electronic voting machine will b e used.”  
 
  
He contended that according to the credible information Election 
Commission failed to touch 100%  voters, while revising the 
Voter’s lists , as per commitment of the Secretary, Election 
Commission made in the above said order and it can safely be 
said that only 10% voters, were approached by the Electoral 
Staff.  
2. Mr. Rashid A. Rizvi, learned counsel appearing in 
Constitution Petition No. 111/2012  has supported the plea raised 
by Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC and highlighted that it 
would not b e possible at this stage when the General Elections 
are likely to be held in the near future to revise all the electoral 
lists. However, while examining the objection of Mr. Hamid 
Khan he stated that at present a classical example of Karachi can 
be quoted where a good number of voters en -bloc have been 
shown  to be the voters of the different parts of the country , 
although they are/were residing for the last about more than 
10/15 years in Karachi and had cast their votes there during the 
election s held in 20 08 etc. He stated that this Court in the case Const. P No.31 -2011 etc  - 4 - 
Worker’s Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan   (PLD 2012 
SC 681) , has observed as follows: - 
“67. Fair, free, honest and just elections are sine qua non  for 
strengthening of democracy. To achieve this goal, accurate 
preparation/revision of electoral roll is immediately required to be 
undertaken by the Election Commission through credible and 
independent agencies. In so doing, the conventional ways and 
means of merely depending upon NADRA alone or other simila r 
bodies must be discounted forthwith. Accordingly, we direct the 
Election Commissioner to undertake door -to-door checking of 
voters’ lists and complete the process of updating/revision of the 
electoral rolls by engaging Army and the Frontier Corps, if nee d 
be. This exercise should be undertaken as early as possible and in 
accordance with the time limit fixed in Imran Khans’  case  
(supra).”  
 
3. Dr. M. Shamim Rana,  learned counsel appearing in Constn. 
Petition No. 123/2012  also raised an identical complaint an d to 
demonstrate  his plea has placed on record relevant material  
through CMA No.4830/2012 ,  a perusal whereof indicates that 
the plea raised by Mr. M/s Hamid Khan and Rashid A. Rizvi, 
learned counsel is correct. He has gone through the 
documents/electoral lists which he has presented before us  to 
demonstrate that a good number of  votes of the residents of 
Karachi  have been shifted to Mansehra, Attock etc.  
4. Mr. Jehanghir Badar, who is appearing in Const.   Petition 
No.45/2007  has also supported the conte ntions which have been 
raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners and has requested 
that an appropriate order be passed for the rectifying/correction in 
the Electoral Lists in Karachi.  
5. Before the commencement of the proceedings, Mr. Khalid 
Anwar , learned Sr. ASC , who  was appearing in another important Const. P No.31 -2011 etc  - 5 - 
matter , also pointed out similar complaints in respect of  the 
electoral lists  at Karachi and prayed that an order be passed 
directing the Election Commission to rectify/correct the electoral 
lists in Karachi , as without the consent of the voters, the names of 
a large number of  people have been shifted from Karachi to other 
town /cities  of Pakistan.  
6. The learned DAG present on behalf of Election 
Commission , when confronted with the above complaints /situation 
stated that he needs some time.  His request is entertained. 
However, in the meanwhile, copy of this order be sent to the 
Secretary , Election Commission so that he may depute a Senior 
Officer  alongwith  the learned DAG to appear in the Court to 
satisfy us as to under what circumstances , the names of about 
more than three million voters have been shifted from Karachi to 
other towns /cities  of Pakistan. In the meanwhile, as there are 
credible complaints, the Election Commission , subject to all just  
exceptions  may also examine  the possibility of  revers ing the 
names of the voters back to Karachi where the ir names were 
previously recorded leaving an option with such voters to transfer 
of their votes if they so desire d to any other town/cit y of the 
Pakistan , by making a request to the respective representative of 
Election Commission of Pakistan  before the announcement of the 
schedule of elections.  Const. P No.31 -2011 etc  - 6 -
