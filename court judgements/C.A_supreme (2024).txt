ORDER  
 
 
Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J. :  Upon his persistent and 
willful disobedience in complying with the directions issued by this 
Court in paragraphs No. 177 and 178 of the judgment handed 
down in the case of Dr. Mubashir Hassan (PLD 201 0 SC 265) the 
former Prime Minister of Pakistan / Chief Executive of the 
Federation Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani was tried, convicted and 
sentenced for committing contempt of this Court and consequently 
he stood disqualified as a member of the National Assembl y and 
also stood removed from the office of the Prime Minister of 
Pakistan / Chief Executive of the Federation. Thereafter Raja 
Pervaiz Ashraf, MNA was elected to the said exalted office and on 
27.06.2012 this Court had expressed hope and confidence that t he 
new Prime Minister / Chief Executive, who had stepped into the 
shoes of his predecessor in office, would implement the above 
mentioned directions of this Court. On that date the learned 
Attorney -General for Pakistan was required to obtain instructions 
from the new Prime Minister / Chief Executive in the matter and to 
inform this Court of his response on the next date of hearing, i.e. 
12.07.2012.   
 Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 486 of 2010  
in Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2002, etc.  3 
2. On 12.07.2012 the learned Attorney -General for Pakistan  did 
not come up with any definite response of th e Prime Minister / 
Chief Executive in the relevant regard. In its order passed on that 
date this Court reproduced its earlier order dated 08.03.2012 
wherein the then Prime Minister / Chief Executive was directed to 
implement the directions of this Court co ntained in paragraphs No. 
177 and 178 of the judgment delivered in the case of Dr. Mubashir 
Hassan  “regardless of any advice tendered earlier or in future” and 
while reiterating the said direction the present Prime Minister / 
Chief Executive was also direc ted accordingly while requiring him 
to act in the matter forthwith and to c ause a report to be 
submitted before this Court in that regard by 25.07.2012 failing 
which this Court might initiate any appropriate action under the 
Constitution and the law. It is  quite unfortunate that the Prime 
Minister / Chief Executive failed even to comply with that order 
and neither the directions contained in paragraphs No. 177 and 
178 of the judgment in Dr. Mubashir Hassan ’s case were obeyed till 
25.07.2012 nor any report c alled for in the earlier order of this 
Court was submitted by the specified date. Instead, on 25.07.2012 
the learned Attorney -General for Pakistan sought time till today to 
work out a solution to the outstanding issues but no meaningful 
progress in that re gard has been reported by him today.  
 
3. On the last date of hearing the learned Attorney -General for 
Pakistan had maintained before us that this Court was not 
properly assisted on facts and law before rendering its judgment in 
the case of Dr. Mubashir Ha ssan and also at the time of handing 
down its judgment in the review petition filed in that case and, 
therefore, the said judgments were, in his words, “un -
implementable” and proper recourse for seeking revisiting of those 
judgments by this Court is being mulled by the Federal 
Government. We had on the last date of hearing, and we have 
today, remained unable to subscribe to the said submission of the 
learned Attorney -General on account of the fact that the said 
judgments passed by a Larger Bench of this Cou rt and by the Full 
Court respectively have already attained finality and also because 
the present Bench is only seized of implementation proceedings Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 486 of 2010  
in Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2002, etc.  4 
vis-à-vis those judgments. It goes without saying that an 
implementation Bench cannot go behind a concluded  and final 
judgment or revisit the same. We may observe at this stage, and we 
observe so with respect to the esteemed elective office of the Prime 
Minister / Chief Executive, that the ostensible calculated defiance 
on his part through adoption of dilatory tactics and putting up 
excuses for resisting implementation of this Court’s directions may 
know no bounds but at the same time restraint exercised by this 
Court is also not without any limit.  
 
4. Pushed into such an unfortunate situation we hereby issue 
notice to Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Prime Minister of Pakistan / Chief 
Executive of the Federation, under section 17 of the Contempt of 
Court Ordinance (V of 2003) read with Article 204 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 to show 
cause as to why he may not be proceeded against for committing 
contempt of this Court by not complying with the relevant 
directions of the Court. He shall, in accordance with the provisions 
of section 17 of the said Ordinance, appear before the Court in 
person o n the next date of hearing.
