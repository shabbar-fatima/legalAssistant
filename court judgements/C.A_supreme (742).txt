ORDER
 
  We have heard learned counsel  for the petitioner, who 
has read following Paragraphs from the Judgment dated  
08.06.2012, reported as Workers’ Party Pakistan through Akhtar 
Hussain, Advocate & 6 others v. Federation of Pakistan & 2 others
 CMA No.64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011  - 2 - 
 (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 681) .  For the sake of convenience, 
the aforesaid Paragraphs are reproduced herein below :- 
“40. A bare  reading of Article 218(3) makes it clear that the 
Election Commission is charged with the duty to 'organize' 
and 'conduct the election'. The language of the Article implies 
that the Election Commission is responsible not only for 
conducting the election i tself, but also for making all 
necessary arrangements for the said purpose, prior to the 
Election Day. By conferring such responsibility on the 
Election Commission, the Constitution ensures that all 
activities both prior, on and subsequent to Election Day,  that 
are carried out in anticipation thereof, adhere to standards of 
justness and fairness, are honest, in accordance with law and 
free from corrupt practices. This Court in Election 
Commission of Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others  (PLD 
1989 SC 396), ob served that "(g)enerally speaking election is 
a process which starts with the issuance of the election 
programme and consists of the various links and stages in 
that behalf, as for example, filing of nomination papers, their 
scrutiny, the hearing of object ions and the holding of actual 
polls. If any of these links is challenged it really (is) 
tantamount to challenging the said process of election". It 
interpreted that the phrase 'conduct the election' as having 
"wide import" and including all stages involve d in the 
election process. These observations subject all election 
related activities that take place between the commencement 
and the end of the election process to the jurisdiction 
conferred on the Election Commission under Article 218(3). 
The Election C ommission therefore has to test all election 
related activities that are carried out in the relevant period, 
both individually and collectively, against the standards 
enumerated therein.  
41. The Election Commission may also exercise its powers in 
anticipat ion of an ill that may have the effect of rendering the 
election unfair. In the case titled as In Re: Petition filed by 
Syed Qaim Ali Shah Jellani  (PLD 1991 Jour. 41) the 
Elections Commission exercised its powers under Article 
218(3) pre -emptively, by maki ng all necessary arrangements 
to ensure that a certain class of people would be allowed to 
vote. This case implies that where a violation of the standards 
mentioned in Article 218(3) has not as yet taken place, the 
Election Commission is legally empowered under Article 
218(3) to exercise its powers pre -emptively in order to avoid 
a violation of these standards. Furthermore, Mst. Qamar 
Sultana v. Public at Large  (1989 MLD 360) and In Re: 
Complaint of Malpractices in Constituency No. NA -57, 
Sargodha -V (supra)  both reinforce the argument that the 
Election Commission is fully empowered by Article 218(3) to 
make 'such orders as may in its opinion be necessary for 
ensuring that the election is fair, honest etc'. These decisions CMA No.64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011  - 3 - 
 recognize that the Election Commissi on enjoys broad powers 
not only to take pre -emptive action but also to pass any and 
all orders necessary to ensure that the standards of 'honesty, 
justness and fairness' mentioned in Article 218(3) are met.  
42. The Parliament has framed different laws to e ffectuate the 
above constitutional provision and to regulate elections to the 
National and Provincial Assemblies. ROPA reiterates and 
further vests the Election Commission with the 
responsibilities and powers to, inter alia, regulate and check 
intra -party affairs and actions taken by candidates and 
parties in anticipation of and on Election Day, resolve all 
election disputes, declare the election void and to award 
punishments for violating relevant election laws. In 
appreciation of the arduousness of its ta sk, section 5(2) of 
ROPA further empowers the Election Commission to "require 
any person or authority to perform such functions or render 
such assistance for the purposes of this Act as...it may direct". 
The Election Commission may, under section 103(c) of  ROPA 
also "issue such instructions and exercise such powers, and 
make such consequential orders, as may in its opinion, be 
necessary for ensuring that an election is conducted honestly, 
justly and fairly, and in accordance with the provisions of this 
Act and the rules". Article 220 of the Constitution also directs 
the Federal and Provincial machinery to assist the Election 
Commission in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities. 
The law, therefore, entrusts the Election Commission with 
exclusive, broa d and extensive powers to attend to all issues 
related directly and ancillary to the election process.  
43. Article 218(3) also empowers the Election Commission to 
ensure that the election process does not suffer from any 
corrupt and/or illegal practices. S ections 78, 79, 80, 80 -A, 81 
and 83 of ROPA comprehensively define the terms "corrupt 
practices" and "illegal practices". ROPA in sections 82, 99 
and 100 further elaborates the consequences of such 
practices and enunciate that the same form a sufficient ba sis 
for the Election Commission to, inter alia, imprison, fine and 
disqualify those who violate them. These provisions, 
therefore, subsume all those impugned activities as 
cognizable by the Election Commission. Similarly, Section 
103(a) of ROPA instructs t he Election Commission to ensure 
a "fair election". In doing so it implies that "large scale 
malpractices including coercion, intimidation and pressures, 
prevailing at the election" would negate the 'fairness' 
elections are to embody. While sections 78, 79 , 80, 80 -A, 81 
and 83 specify activities that   the   Election   Commission   
can   regulate   and   check   under  Article 218(3), section 
103(a), substantially enhances this defined spectrum of 
cognizable activities and reinforces the obligation to check  
them. In section 103(c) section it empowers the Election 
Commission to issue instructions, exercise its powers and 
make orders to effectuate the said standard.  
44. While there is no cavil with the proposition that the Election CMA No.64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011  - 4 - 
 Commission stands as an inde pendent and fully empowered 
constitutional body, the 18th and 20th Constitutional 
Amendments, have substantially enhanced the degree of 
independence and the scope of powers enjoyed by the 
Election Commission. Prior to 18th Constitutional 
Amendment, the Com mission comprised the Chief Election 
Commissioner and two retired Judges as members thereof. 
Vide the 18th Amendment, the strength of the members has 
been increased from two to four, with the additional 
requirement that each of the members be a Judge of Hi gh 
Court of each Province, duly appointed by the President as 
per prescribed procedure provided for appointment of the 
Commissioner in clauses (2)(a) & (b) of Article 218(1) of the 
Constitution. The entrustment of greater responsibility and 
the enhancement  of its strength are part of an effort fully to 
equip the Commission to discharge its broad set of 
responsibilities. These also reflect a growing trust in the 
Commission to act independently and without influence in 
conducting and organizing elections "fai rly, honestly, justly 
and in accordance with law". In the parliamentary system of 
government a constitutionally independent and empowered 
Election Commission rests as one of the foundational stones 
of a democratic setup. In the past, the Election Commissio n 
has succumbed to external influence and failed to discharge 
its responsibilities successfully. The inadequacy of the 
Commission's effort in organizing and conducting the election 
to the above standards has had detrimental repercussions for 
the democratic  system in Pakistan. Not only has it 
undermined the legitimacy of the elections and the claim of 
the winning party to form government, but has also, by 
disregarding express constitutional dictates regulating the 
same, devastated the trust and faith reposed  by the citizenry 
in the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution. This is 
why Pakistan has witnessed political parties, individual 
candidates, as well as the citizenry, reject and denounce some 
of the election results. The rigging of elections was ci ted as a 
major ground for the imposition of martial law in the country 
in 1977, which was unfortunately validated by the Supreme 
Court. Consequently, an unconstitutional order was imposed 
on the people of Pakistan with the false hope of holding fair 
and fr ee elections within 90 days. The solemn commitment 
made by General Ziaul Haq, Chief Martial Law 
Administrator, however, was never honoured and the people 
of Pakistan remained subject to an unconstitutional regime 
for nearly 11 years. In light of the powers  and independence 
that the Election Commission enjoys today, such an 
unfortunate abuse of power and disregard of the 
constitutional dictate to establish and preserve democracy 
seems impossible ”. 
2.  We have pointed out to the learned Deputy Attorney 
Genera l that as this Judgment was announced by this Court on CMA No.64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011  - 5 - 
 08.06.2012, wherein different Articles of the Constitution have 
been interpreted , particularly , Article 218 ( 3), crux whereof is 
available in different paras, particul arly, reference of which has 
been made hereinab ove, therefore, there should not be any 
technical problem to overcome any of the difficulties , if faced by 
the Election Commission of Pakistan , in organizing , conducting 
and making arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the 
Elections are  conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance 
with law and that corrupt practices are guarded against.   
3.  Learned counsel for the Election Commission of 
Pakistan  stated that to implement the Judgment as well as to 
ensure holding of Elections str ictly in accordance with the Article 
218(3) of the Constitution, certain amendments have been 
suggested, details of which he is required to file before us by  
placing a comparative statement along with the other steps taken 
to implement the Judgment in view  of the observations made 
therein.   
4.  The learned DAG may also seek instructions from the 
concerned quarters with reference to the implementation of 
Judgment wherein Article 218(3) of the Constitution had also 
been interpreted by th e Court elaborately, therefore, the 
Executive Authorities in terms of Article 190 of the  
Constitution should have no hesitation to implement the 
Judgment and also to enforce the Constitution in letter and spirit CMA No.64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011
 - 6 - 
 read with the interpretation which ha d been made.  This 
comprehe nsive report shall be submitted by both the sides by 
tomorrow.
