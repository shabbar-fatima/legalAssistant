2.  Heard. Record perused.  
3.  Given red-handed arrest of the petitioner with a  
considerable quantity of  a lethal  contraband , confirmed by a positive 
forensic report  that brings the case  within the  remit of  ‘Prohibition , 
contemplated by section 51 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 
1997 , petitioner’s claim  of false implication  is an issue that cannot be 
attended without going beyond the scope of tentative asses sment, a 
venture prohibited by law.  On our own analysis of the record,  view 
concurrently taken by the courts below is not open to exception . 
Petition fails. Leave declined.
