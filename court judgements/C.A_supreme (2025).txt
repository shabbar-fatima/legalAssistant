  Dear Sir,  
 
 This is with reference to the letter dated 22nd May 
2008 addressed by Malik Mohammad Qayyum, the then 
Attorney General of Pakistan to Mr. Daniel Zappelli, 
Attorney Genera, Geneva, Switzerland.  
     
 In view of the direction given by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in Paragraph 178 (copy attached as 
Annex -I) of its judgment dated 16th December 2009 in 
the case of Dr. Mobashir Hassan, reported as PLD 2010 
SC 265, the aforesaid letter is hereby withdrawn and may 
be treated as never written and therefore, revival of 
requests, status and claims, is sought.  
 This is without prejudice to the legal rights and 
defences of the President s/Heads of State which may be 
available under the law, constitution and international 
law.

Re: PP/11105/1997 and CP 289/97 and related proceedings.  
 
  
 Dear Sir,  
 
 Please refer to our instructions and the letter dated 5th 
November, 2012 sent to the General Attorney of Geneva, please 
explain the position of Government of Pakistan to the General 
Attorney of Geneva which is summarized hereinbelow in order to 
simplify the approach of the case before him.  
 
1. At the outset I must state that the Head of State viz 
President of Pakistan enjoys complete and absolute 
protection and immunity u nder Article 248 (2) of the 
Constitution of Pakistan 1973 (copy attached as Annex -1) as 
well as International Law, which is neither being waived nor 
lifted.  
2. Requests for mutual legal assistance was made by Senator 
Saif-ur-Rehman, the then Chairman of Ehte sab 
(Accountability) Bureau and Chaudhry Muhammad Farooq, 
the then Attorney General of Pakistan through various letters 
written in 1997 without permission from the Federal 
Government. Thus all these requests and letters stand on the 
same footing as those o f the then Attorney General of 
Pakistan Malik Muhammad Qayyumm’s letter dated 22nd 
May 2008. Consequently all of the said requests and letters 
written by Senator Saif -ur-Rehman and Chaudhry 
Muhammad Farooq were and are illegal and have no legal 
effect and are hereby withdrawn by Government of Pakistan 
and may be treated as never have been written, keeping into 
view the dictum laid down by Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
paragraph 177 and 178 of the Judgment in the case of Dr. Crl.M.A.No.486/2010 in Crl.Crl.A.No.22/02 and SMC No.4/2010 etc.  - 5 - 
 Mobashar Hassan, dated 16th Decemb er 2009, reported as 
PLD 2010 SC 265 (Copy attached as Annex -II). 
3. I understand the order of closing of case passed by Mr. 
Daniel Zappelli former Attorney General of Geneva, on 25h 
August 2008 has also attained finality and under Swiss Law it 
cannot be re -opened for several legal reasons.  
4. Government of Pakistan understands that revival of status of 
civil party can take place only when there are pending 
criminal proceedings in Switzerland. Since no criminal 
proceedings are admittedly pending in Switzerland t here are 
legal constraints and bar in such revival.   
5. Mutual legal assistance, as explained hereinabove, was never 
lawfully sought and in any event necessary documents and 
evidence have already been transmitted by the Swiss 
authorities to the Government of  Pakistan and as such it has 
served its purpose. Furthermore the legal assistance 
requested in 1997 has been completely executed.  
6. Moreover since the Judgment was passed by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Dr. Mobashar Hassan dated 
16th Decembe r, 2009, much has happened factually and 
legally in Pakistan in respect of both the SGS and Cotecna 
cases in which Government of Pakistan was a civil party in 
Swiss proceedings.  
7. References filed by Ehtesab (Accountability) Bureau before 
Accountability Cour ts in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in SGS and 
Cotecna cases against Messrs A.R.Siddiqui, Asif Ali Zardar 
and others for which mutual legal assistance was sought by 
Government of Pakistan from Switzerland and in which 
regard Investigating Magistrate, Geneva from ti me to time, 
transmitted documents and evidence to Pakistan, have 
resulted in the acquittal of the main accused Mr. A.R. 
Siddiqui. Regarding Mr. Asif Ali Zardari the Accountability 
Courts have accepted that he enjoys complete and absolute 
immunity under Art icle 248 (2) of the Constitution of 
Pakistan, 1973.  
8. Even otherwise in the judgments in both the case s, the 
Honourable Judges have held that Mr. Asif Ali Zardari has not 
done any wrong doing has not committed any act of 
corruption and corrupt practices and that no loss was caused 
to the Government of Pakistan by the award of pre -
shipment. Inspection contract to SGS and Cotecna by Crl.M.A.No.486/2010 in Crl.Crl.A.No.22/02 and SMC No.4/2010 etc.  - 6 - 
 Government of Pakistan, for which all legal/codal formalities 
were complied with. Thus, no offence or crime has been 
committed in Pakistan in respect of the award of the SGS 
and Cotecna contracts. Consequently, as no crime has been 
committed in Pakistan the alleged offence of money 
laundering, if any, under Swiss law does not seem to be 
applicable or attracted. (Copies of Judgments a re attached as 
Annex -III and IV)  
9. In view of the foregoing Government of Pakistan would 
understand and appreciate to receive official confirmation 
about the inability of the Swiss authorities to revive 
Government of Pakistan’s status as civil party, mutual 
assistance and alleged claims.  
10.This finally brings to an end the matter s/issues that had 
arisen and initiated in 1997.  
 
Yours sincerely,  
Sd/- 
Justice (R) Yasmin Abbasey  
                         Secretary”  
 
3.  It is to be noted that letter dated 5th Novem ber, 
2012 has been issued by the Federal Government with the 
approval of this Court vide order dated 14.11.2012 .  
       
4.  At this stage, second letter referred hereinabove, 
which has been written on behalf of the Government of 
Pakistan after letter date d 5th November, 2012  needs no 
comments being self explanatory , prima facie  to form the  
opinion  and necessity  felt by the then Federal Government  
to enter into correspondence with Dr. Nicholas Jeanding, 
counsel/advocate of the Federation of Pakistan .   Crl.M.A.No.486/2010 in Crl.Crl.A.No.22/02 and SMC No.4/2010 etc.  - 7 - 
 5.  Reference of another correspondence between 
Judicial Authority , Public Ministry , Republican and Canton of 
Geneva and Mr. Nicholas Jeanding, attorney of the letter 
dated 4th February, 2013 is also necessary and relevant.  He 
has also placed on record order o f “non-entry into the 
subject ”, dated 4th February, 2013 by the Judicial Authority 
of Republican Canton of Geneva, one of para relating to 
Abuse of  Power and R uling. For convenience same is 
reproduced below: - 
  c)  Abuse of Power  
“Swiss law establishes as  a general principle the 
prohibition of the abuse of power, such as it arises from 
Article 2, Subparagraph 2 of the Civil Code. The criminal 
prosecution authorities are specifically required to 
conform thereto (CPC, Article 3, Subparagraph 2 b). In 
this ca se, the Republic of Pakistan’s procedures 
constitutes an abuse of power. Indeed, it consists of 
demanding resumption of the criminal procedure 
P/11105/1997 , while maintaining that such resumption 
could not take place. It is a question of a procedure 
consti tuting venire contra facturm proprium, that is to say 
one of the traditional instances of an abuse of power.”     
RULING  
On these grounds, the Public Ministry:  
1. Decides not to enter into the subject of the facts 
referred to by the procedure P/11105/1997 ( CPC, 
Article 310, Subparagraph 1 b and 323).  
2. States that the costs of proceedings shall be left to 
the charge of the State (CPC Articles 422 and 423, 
Subparagraph 1).  
3. Notifies this order:  
-the republic of Pakistan, i.e. for it Me Nicolas 
Jeandin, pos t box 3200, 1211 Geneva 3  
4. Communicates this order to:  
 The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs  Crl.M.A.No.486/2010 in Crl.Crl.A.No.22/02 and SMC No.4/2010 etc.  - 8 - 
 Geneva, 4 February 2013  
The Registrar    The Public Prosecutor  
 
Lella Deloche Ramos    Oliver JORNOT”  
 
6.  Learned Attorney General stated that appeal 
against the order of the “non-entry into the subject ” was 
maintainable within 10 days from the order noted 
hereinabove, relevant observation from the said order is 
reproduced hereinbelow:  
  “The parties can attack the order of non -entry into the 
subject within  the ten days before the appeal authority  of 
recourse, that is to say the Criminal Appeal Court (CPC, Articles 
310, Subparagraph 2, and 322, Subparagraph 2 and LOJ 128, 
Subparagraph 1). The appeal must  be justified and addressed in 
within (CPC, Article 396 , Subparagraph 1).  
  The parties have been made aware of the fact that the 
costs of the appeal proceedings shall be at their expense, if their 
appeal is inadmissible, if they withdrawn it or if they do not win 
the case (CPC, Article 428, Subparagraph 1). I n certain 
conditions, the costs of the appeal proceedings could also be 
charged to an appellant that had obtained a more favourable 
decision (CPC, Article 428, Subparagraph 2).  
 
 
7.   Learned Attorney General further stated that the 
above letter along -with the observations was not available 
on the official record. Further that order of non -entry into 
the subject was not communicated to the Government of 
Pakistan as per available record. He further stated that it is 
yet to be established that whether the ent ry into the subject 
has been communicated or not? However, vide letter dated 
20th June, 2013, he has been informed by the Secretary to Crl.M.A.No.486/2010 in Crl.Crl.A.No.22/02 and SMC No.4/2010 etc.  - 9 -
