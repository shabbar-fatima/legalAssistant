JUDGMENT  
 
SAYYED MAZAHAR ALI AKBAR NAQVI, J. - Through this appeal by 
leave of the Court under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the appellant has called in questi on the 
judgment dated 01.02.2017 passed by the Peshawar High Court, 
Peshawar, whereby writ petition filed by him was dismissed.  
2.  Succinctly stated the facts of the matter are that the 
appellant  was working as Senior Accounts Clerk  (BPS-11) in the 
respon dent department. Pursuant to introduction of Voluntary 
Separation Scheme (VSS), the appellant  applied for the same. 
Considering his basic salary as Rs.7605/ - per month , he was paid 
emoluments of Rs.198,8999/ - vide letter dated 05.03.2008 . At the time 
of final settlement, an amount of Rs.81,520/ - was also recovered on 
account of outs tanding house building advance. However, the appellant  
claimed  that his last basic pay was Rs.8070/ - and the emoluments 
should be calculated on the basis of this last pay. Accord ing to him, the 
outstanding amount of house building advance was Rs.7 7750/ - instead 
of Rs.81520/ -. Keeping in view the wrong calculation, he served 
grievance notice on 03.11.2008  upon the respondents but the same was Civil Appeal No. 1477/2019  2
never responded. The appellant  then fil ed petition before Labour Court , 
Peshawar, which stood dismissed vide order dated 27.05.2010. This 
decision was maintained by the Labour Appellate Tribunal  vide 
judgment dated 06.06.2012 as also by the learned Peshawar High 
Court vide impugned judgment. He nce, this appeal  by leave of the Court.  
3.  The appellant , who appeared in person, submitted that  the 
learned courts below have misread the evidence  and decided the matter 
in a hasty manner without deeply apprais ing the record ; that according 
to Last Pay Certificate (LPC), his basic salary  was Rs.8070/ - but the 
courts below never taken into consideration this document; that he is 
put to loss of Rs.465/ - per month  in pension , thus a valuable right has 
been accrued in his favour;  that he had availed house bu ilding loa n of 
Rs.77,520/ - but the department h as wrongly deducted Rs.81,520/ - 
thereby putting him to financial loss of Rs.4000/ -. 
4.  On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent s 
mainly contended that there are  concurrent findings of three court s 
below against the appellant  and that the claim of the appellant  is false 
and he does not deserve any relief  by this Court .  
5.  We have heard the appellant  in person and learned counsel 
for the respondent s at some length and have perused the record.  
6.  It appears from the record that the department had 
introduced Voluntary Separation Scheme somewhere in November, 
2007 . The appellant  applied for the same and vide letter dated 
21.01.2008, the appellant  was asked  to complete the requisite 
documents by 25.0 1.2008. After completing all codal formalities, he was 
paid the emoluments vide letter dated 05.03.2008  considering his basic 
pay as Rs.7605/ - per month . We have perused two documents 
available on record. One is Last Pay Certificate (LPC) dated 29.03.2018  
(Exh.PW2/5) and Initial Pay Slip dated 28.02.2008 ( Exh.PW -2/4). Both 
these documents clearly show that at the relevant time, the basic pay of 
the appellant  was Rs.8070/ -. The appellant  has also produced on 
record  an email dated 09.03.2008 ( Ex.PW -2/5), writ ten by Manager HR, 
Peshawar to General Manager, PTCL, which was to the effect that  
according to service book, the basic pay of the appellant  was Rs.8070/ -. 
The learned courts below while refusing the claim of the appellant  put 
much stress on the point that  while appearing as PW -3, he had admitted 
during cross -examination that his basic salary was Rs.7605/ - per 
month. However, in view of the aforesaid documents  available on Civil Appeal No. 1477/2019  3
record , which clearly show that at the relevant time the basic salary of 
the appellan t was Rs.8070/ -, the oral statement  of appellant  has no 
force and the same cannot be used against him to deprive him of his 
valuable rights. The appellant has admitted before us that at the time of 
cross -examination, he inadvertently mentioned his basic salary as 
Rs.7605/ - and later on he tried to rectify his mistake by placing reliance 
on the aforesaid documents but these documents were never taken into 
consideration by the courts below . There is a well known dicta that ‘a 
man can tell a lie but a document  cannot’. If a person has or has been 
bestowed some legal right and he omitted to claim such legal right 
through oral assertion but the best documentary evidence of which the 
case in its nature is susceptible is found in his favour then the 
documentary evi dence in favour of a person should be given credence. 
When we confronted learned counsel for the respondents with this 
aspect of the matter, he candidly conceded that as only a difference of 
approximately Rs.450/ - per month in the pension and an amount of 
Rs.47000/ - in the commutation would occur, he would not oppose the 
claim of the appellant . So far as the difference of Rs.4000/ - in the  hous e 
building loan amount is concerned, learned counsel for the respondent s 
also frankly conceded that since it is a me ager amount, he will not 
oppose the claim of the appellant .  
7.  For what has been discussed above, this appeal is allowed 
and the impugned judgment is set aside. The respondent department is 
directed to recalculate the  monthly pension and the amount of 
outstanding house building advance of the appellant in the light of this 
judgment and pay the difference  to the appellant  within a period of one 
month.
