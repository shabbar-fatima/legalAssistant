ORDER  
1. Civil Review Petition  No. 266 of 2019  
This Civil Review Petition (‘CRP’) was filed on 11 March 2019  by the 
Ministry of Defence  seeking r eview of the judgment dated 6 February 
2019 . The learned Attorney General for Pakistan (‘ the AG ’) states that 
the Government of Pakistan and its Ministry of Defence do not want 
to press their CRP.  
2. Civil Review Petition  No. 267 of 2019  
This Civil Review Petition was filed by the Int elligence Bureau on 13 
March 2019  seeking review of the Judgment dated 6 February 2019 . 
CMA No. 8270 of 2023  is filed on 26 September 2023  and seeks to 
withdraw  its CRP .  
3. Civil Review Petition  No. 268 of 2019  
This Civil Review Petition was filed on 7 March 2019  by the Pakistan 
Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (‘ PEMRA ’). CMA No. 8288 of 
2023 is filed on 27 September 2023  and seeks  to withdraw its CRP .  
4. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 3575 of 2019  
This application was submitte d by the Pakistan Tehreek -e-Insaf 
(‘PTI’) on 11 March 2019  seeking to be arrayed as a party. Syed Ali 
Zafar, ASC  representing PTI states that PTI does not want to  press its Civil Review Petition No.266 of 20 19 etc                                                                              3 
 
application , to become party , as upon reflection PTI has realized that 
the judgment dated 6 February 2019  is in accordance with the law.  
5. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 3577 of 2019  
 
This application was filed on 7 March 2019  by Sh. Rasheed Ahmed 
wanting to be joined as a party. He was represented by Mr. 
Amanullah Kanrani, ASC . We are informed by learned AOR that Mr. 
Amanullah Kanrani has been appointed as Law Minister of the 
Government of Balochistan and seeks  time to engage another counsel 
or shall himself argue the application on the next date of hearing.  
6. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 3579 of 2019  
This application was filed by Muttahida Quami Movement (‘ MQM ’) on 
7 March 2019 . Sh. Mahmood Ahmad , learned AOR states that Mr. 
Irfan Qadir, l earned ASC , represented MQM and he was unable to 
contact him and does not know if he still  represents MQM and thus 
may be given an opportunity to contact him. We are not concerned 
with the internal matters of counsel.   
7. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 3582 of 2019  
This application was filed on 7 March 2019  by Mr. Muhammad Ijaz ul 
Haq who sought to expunge  something in paragraph 4 of the 
judgment dated 6 February 2019 . However, p aragraph 4 refers to a 
report submitte d by ISI (CMA No. 1229 of 2018).  Therefore, w e 
inquired from  Mr. M.  A. Ghaffar -ul-Haq, learned ASC,  whether Mr. 
Muhammad Ijaz ul Haq takes exemption to the report of the ISI or 
what was observed by this Court,  and learned counsel sought time to 
take instructions and to file an affidavit of  Mr. Muhammad Ijaz -ul-
Haq.  
8. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 3610 of 2019  
This application was filed on 7 March 2019  by the Election 
Commission of Pakistan seeking to delete certain observations made 
in paragraph  33. Malik Qamar Afzal, learned ASC , states that he is 
now under instructions to withdraw the application.  
9. During the hearing a number of questions arose, including (a) non -
fixation of these applications for a considerably long period of time, Civil Review Petition No.266 of 20 19 etc                                                                              4 
 
(b) the simultaneous filing and reason for filing the said CRPs and  
applications, (c) whether constitutional and statutory bodies acted 
independently in filing the  same  and (d) whether, as asserted by 
some, the judgment dated 6 February 2019 has been implemented .  
10. Since adjournments have been sought and as certain parties are not 
in attendance, therefore, they and all are given another opportunity . 
We note that some have publicly  stated that they knew what had 
happened , yet the judgment did not consider their point of view. This 
is surprising given that it was noted in paragraph 17 of the judgment 
that: 
‘All the hearings in this case were conducted in open 
court. We had permitted those aggrieved and those 
whose interest may be affected to come forward and 
had also pe rmitted them to file documents and written 
submission.’  
In any event we are provid ing another opportunity to all to submit in 
writing through affidavit s if they want to disclose facts  pertaining to 
this matter . The learned AG however states that the matter attends to 
events of a certain period and its scope should not be extended.   
11. If any party or any one wants to file anything  the same be filed by or 
before  Friday , 27 October 2023 . Hearing is a djourned to  
Wednesday , 1 Novem ber 2023 .
