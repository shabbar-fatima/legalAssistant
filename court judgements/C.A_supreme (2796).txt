ORDER  
IFTIKHAR  MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ .- Suo Motu Case 
No.14/2009  relates to violation of this Court’s order passed in     SMC 16/11 etc.  3
Crl. Petitions No. 36 and 37 of 1999. Details of the same find 
mentioned in the following para  of order dated 22.03.2013 passed 
in SMC -16/2011 :- 
“42.   It is to be seen that there had been 
question marks on  the allotments of the lands at the 
rates lower than market value, therefore, on 3rd 
January, 2001,  in pursuance of Sindh Urban State Land 
(Cancellation of Allotments, Conversion and Exchanges) 
Ordin ance, 2000, the allotments, conversions or 
exchanges of urban state l ands obtained or granted for 
residential, commercial or industrial purposes at the 
rates lower than the market value in violation of law or 
ban from 01.01.1985 were  cancelled. However, a 
committee under section 4(2) of the Ordinance was 
constituted for carrying out the purpose s of the 
Ordinance and it was mentioned therein that after 
making such inquiry as is deemed fit, if the government 
is satisfied that the allotments, conversions or 
exchanges of the urban state land are obtained or 
granted for residential, commercial or industrial 
purposes at the rates lower than the market value in 
violation of law or ban, it shall determine the amount of 
loss caused to Government and call upon the per son 
concerned to pay such amount within the specified 
period. The Committee so constituted, reportedly, has 
not concluded its task so far.”  
 
2.   It is to be noted that during pendency of SMC No.14/09  
Mr. Muhammad Yousaf Leghari, former Advocate General, S indh 
stated that he would personally look into the matter and shall 
submit the report after examining each case independently.  In 
pursuance of the order dated 6.10.2009 a report containing details 
of the allotments  of commercial plots/residential land  which were SMC 16/11 etc.  4
regularized in exercise of purported power under Sindh Urban State 
Land (Cancellation of Allotments, Conversions and Exchanges) 
Ordinance , 2000 (Ordinance  No.III  of 2001 ) dated 3.01.2001 (shall 
be deemed to come into force from the 1st day of January , 1985)  
has been placed on record vide CMA No.4565 /2009.   
3.   Yesterday i.e. 04.04.2013 during hearing  of the case  we 
were informed that the Committee con stituted under Ordinance III 
of 200 1 has so far not concluded it s proceedings. In this view of the 
matter, we direct the Land Utilization Department  to file a 
statement stating that out  of list contained in CMA 4565/2009, how 
many allotment of land were in violation of law have been 
regularized with the reasons , particularly touching to the questions 
whether the allotments were made in a transparent man ner or to 
oblige the influential persons , the government property was allotted  
to them at a throwaway prices. Further, whether the Committee 
had looked into this aspect of the case or not?  The Land U tilizati on 
Department is also directed to submit statement pointing out that 
in how many cases of the allotment of lands have been examined 
and regularized in terms of sections 4 and 5 of the Ordinance III of 
2001 and whether as per section 5(2)  of the Ordinance,  while 
determining the market value of the land, the principle of “willing 
buyer ” and “willing seller ” to pay the price was followed or not, 
which so far have been concluded. The Secretary department  would 
also point out that ou t of the list , which has been  provided, referred 
to hereinabove, about the status and the nature of the property and 
its present market value , notwithstanding to any of the rules  or 
otherwise , what was the price of such land in the market ; whether SMC 16/11 etc.  5
any recovery has been affected after regularization from the 
buyers , whose cases have been regularized. He should complete 
this exercise before the next date of hearing.  
4.   Second limb of this Civil Misc. Ap plication  is with regard 
to transfer/ allotments of the plots, which have been m ade after 
2000 under the policy,  framed in 2006 , in which we have already 
constituted the Commission headed by Mr. Nazar Muhammad 
Laghari, consultant Utilization Dep artment. He was required to 
submit the report within 2 weeks. He is present in the Court and 
stated that copy of the order dated 22.03.2013 was received by 
him on 28.3.2013 , after that the Commission has been constituted 
and on or before the stipulated period , he would  complete  the 
exercise  and submit the report.  
5.   In CMAs No. 213/13 and 219 -K/2013 the High Court 
Bar Association and Malir Bar Association have pray ed that in view 
of the restraining order passed by this Court for transfer of the 
State Land on 28.11.201 2 the department is not issuing allotment 
order to them and that as they represent  the Bar Associations who 
have nothing to do with the land grabbers etc ; It would be 
appropriate to poi nt out that vide order dated 28.11.2012  this Court 
passed a restraint order, which reads as under: - 
“Under these circumstances, we are constrained to dir ect 
that the Deputy Commission ers/District Coordination Officers 
of Sindh, to ensure that immediately the entire reve nue 
record of all the district is kept in the custody of Mukhtiarkar 
in terms of the directives contained in the aforesaid 
judgment of the High Court and shall not be removed from 
the office of the Mukhtiarkar to any other place. Moreover, 
mindful of rampant corruption and organized crime of land SMC 16/11 etc.  6
grabbing, particularly, regarding prime state land, and 
mismanagement/forgeries in the revenue re cord, we hereby, 
until further orders restrain the Government/Revenue 
Department from mutation, allotment, transfer and or 
conversion  of any state land and or keeping any transaction 
or entry in the record of rights in this regard in revenue 
record of Sind h or till the entire revenue record in Sindh is 
reconstructed. The conversion of lease for 30 years or of any 
term upto 99 years shall also be stopped immediately as by 
this mode the state land is being sold out at throwaway price 
without participation of public at large, which the law does 
not permit. Any further conversion or mutation of state land 
in the record of rights from today onwards would be deemed 
nullity and would expose the Deputy Commissioner/DCO of 
the relevant districts/dehs besides others t o contempt 
proceedings. ”  
 
Keeping in view the above directions of the Court it would not be 
possible to modify th e order at this stage without provid ing the 
opportunity of hearing to  the other sides. Let notice of both the 
applications be issued to Member  Board of Rev enue and the Land 
Utilization Department for the next date of hearing.  
6.   CMA 148 -K/2013 has been filed by one Mr. Farid  Ahmed 
Arain, Advocate who has alleged during his arguments that on 
account of fearful influence of the criminals  life o f his family and 
other residents of Al -Ahmed Heights  are not protected. He stated 
that criminal elements, against whom FI Rs have already been 
registered, no action is being taken by the police as a result 
whereof they are not only harassing his family memb ers but also 
the resident  of the project which are increasing day by day. Reply 
of this application has been submitted  by Mr. Ali Sher Jakhrani, 
AIGP Legal through CMA 223 -K/2013,  wherein it has been ad mitted SMC 16/11 etc.  7

K/2013 has  explained the atrocities  being faced by the members of 
the Ahle -Sunnat Wal Jamat. List of the persons , who had lost their 
lives on different occasions  has also been annexed with the 
application but his grievance is that neither  action is being taken 
against the culprits involved in the commission of the offence  nor 
the government is providing any compensation to the heirs of the 
victims. Similarly, so m any persons belonging to their party are 
missing including Maulana Abdul Shakoor but the Government had 
not taken any measures to effect his recovery. Reply has been filed 
on behalf of IGP. Mr . Ali Sher Jakhrani , AIG P Legal  has appeared 
and stated that the  details of the persons who had been murdered,

Advocate General and IGP to look into this matter and submit 
report within three days. Copy of the report shall be  delivered  to

were issued to comply with the order by placing on record the 
affidavits testifying by SHOs, DSPs, SSPs about the e xistence or 
otherwise of the ‘ No-Go’ areas and if it is concluded that the ‘ No-Go’

failed to maintain the writ of government in the said areas .  A 
report (CMA No.233 -K/2013) has been submitt ed without 
complying with the direction. The report submitted is not 
acceptable, therefore, is hereby rejected. However, the IG Police is SMC 16/11 etc.  9
