  Syed Mansoor Ali Shah , J.- 
Civil Petition No.3509 of 2021 : The main case has been decided  
by the Sindh High Court  vide order dated 02.06.2021, therefore, the 
instant matter  arising out of an interim order  has become 
infructuous  and is disposed of accordingly.  
Civil Petition No .1494 -K of 2021 : We have noticed that the 
petitioner was not a party before the High Court a s his application for 
impleadment was dismissed vide order dated 27.5.2021  and 
subsequently  the main petition was decided on 02.6.2021 , which has 
been challenged before us by the said petitioner .  CP No.3509  of 2021 , etc.

   Application by a person who was not a party in the proceedings 
before the High Court:  
2.  This Court in H.M. Saya1 has held in 1969 that “a  person 
who is not a party to a suit or a proceeding may prefer an appeal if he 
is affected by the judgment, decree or order of the trial Court provided 
he obtains leav e from the Court of appeal ”. Since then it has been a 
longstanding and consistent practice of this Court that any person 
who challenges the judgment of the High Court through a petition  or 
appeal, but has not been a party to the proceedings before the High  
Court, first prefers a separate application seeking leave of the Court to 
maintain such a petition  or appeal. The wisdom behind the said 
practice is ; firstly, that it  ensure s that the Court is put on notice that 
the petitioner was not a party in the proce edings before the High 
Court ; and secondly, the petitioner , before addressing the merits of the 
case, has to establish before the Court that he is aggrieved of the 
impugned judgment. Once these conditions are met and the 
application is allowed , by the Court, the petition  or appeal is duly 
numbered and fixed to be heard on merits . This practice has been  
tacitly a part of Order XXXIII, Rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules, 
1980 for a long time and promotes transparency, openness and good 
judicial governance . We, therefore, reiterate the principle in H.M. Saya  
and endorse the said practice  of the Court.   
3.  In the instant case, learned counsel for the petitioner has 
frankly pointed out that he wishes to prefer such an application. Let 
the same be done. Howeve r, the office shall denumber the petition and 
first entertain the aforesaid application, which shall be put up before 
the Court for appropriate orders.  
4.  Office shall also submit a report for our perusal in 
chambers as to how the petition was entertaine d and numbered in 
absence of any application seeking permission to file this civil petition  
in the wake of such a long standing practice of this Court.
