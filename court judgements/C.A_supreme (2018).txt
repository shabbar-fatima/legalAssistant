ORDER  
 
           Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J.  Raja Farhat 
Iqbal, applicant herein, accused in a case of homicide, was 
acquitted by the trial Court; High Court of Sindh, however, 
reversed the findings  and while returning a guilty verdict, 
sentenced him to imprisonment for life , vide judgment dated 
28.12.2005, vires whereof were challenged through an appeal; the 
complainant dissatisfied with the quantum of sentence  came up 
with a petition for enhancemen t of sentence, however, without 
success . It was on 25 -3-2009 when applicant’s learned counsel 
opted to withdraw the appeal, consequently dismissed ; his 
subsequent attempt to seek a review of dismissal of his appeal 
failed on 12.3.2019 ; his failure s, notwithstanding, he was released 
on parole way back on 24.1.2015  and it was one of the reasons 
that weighed with the Court to decline the review . The applicant 
has approached in person once again and was joined by  
Mr. Ghulam Sajjad Gopang, ASC  during the proceedings ; they are 
aggrieved by the office refusal to entertain their application on the Cr. M.A. No.1404 of 2019  2
ground that after dismissal of earlier review petition , there was no 
occasion to entertain the request  and it is in this backdrop that the 
present application (Cr.M .A. No.1404  of 2019) has been posted 
before us .  
2.  Dismissal of review petition foreclosed avenues for 
subsequent attempt s by the applicant  and for that law is well 
settled by now. The applicant cannot escape the consequences of 
course adopted by his duly engaged counsel  merely on the ground 
that he had not so instructed  him, that too so late in the day. 
Being hopelessly misconceived, the instant application is 
dismissed.
