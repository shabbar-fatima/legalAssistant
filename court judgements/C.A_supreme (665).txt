  For reasons to be recorded later in the detailed

Petition Nos. 1148 & 1348 of 2013 are converted into appeals and

& 5477/2013  are disposed of  and we hold and declare as under: - 
i) that the order of the learned High Court dated 
24.6.2013  passed in Writ Petition No. 
7253/2013  is violative of the principle of 
trichotomy of powers, which is one of the CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 800 -L, 801 -L & 802 -L OF 2013 etc  3
foundational principles of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan;  
 
ii) that it is n ot the function of the High Court 
exercising jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution to interfere in the Policy Making 
Domain of the Executive;  
 
iii) that the learned High Court in the exercise of its 
Constitutional jurisdiction directed selection of  
Hajj Group Organizers through bidding process 
and thereby substituted the criterion laid down 
in the Hajj Policy framed by the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs without hearing the appellants 
/ Hajj Group Organizers and others who had 
already been allocated q uota and had made 
arrangements for intending Hujjaj , which is not 
tenable in law;    
 
iv) that the High Court can under Article 199 of the 
Constitution annul an order or a Policy framed  
by the Executive , if it is violative of the 
Constitution, law or is product  of mala fides . 
However, nothing has been placed before this 
Court to indicate that the Hajj Policy challenged 
before this Court seriously suffered from any  of 
these infirmities; and  
 
v) that Ministry of Religious Affairs  shall continue 
to regulate the operat ion of Hajj i.e. enrollment, CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 800 -L, 801 -L & 802 -L OF 2013 etc  4
registration and allocation of quota every year in 
the light of a fair and transparent policy and the 
guidelines to be laid down by this Court in the 
detailed judgment.
