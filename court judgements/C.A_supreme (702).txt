ORDER  
 Jawwad S. Khawaj, CJ.  The National Accountability Bureau has been 
established under the National  Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (No. XVIII of 1999 ), 
the preamble of which states that,  “… it is expedient and necessary to provide for 
effective measures for the detection, investigation, prosecution and speedy disposal of cases 
involving corruption, cor rupt practices, misuse or abuse of power or authority, 
misappropriation of property, taking of kickbacks, commissions and for matters connected 
and ancillary or incidental thereto .” Cases involving NAB have been coming up before 
us including the cases of i mplementation of our judgment in Constitutional Petition CMA 3325/2013 in CRP 270/2011  2 
No. 42 of 2011 dated 25.11.200 0, and a number of other cases, i.e. NRO 
Implementation Case (SMC .4/2010), Rental Power Project Implementation Case 
(CMA 3685/2012 ),  Fiaz Case (CP 2132/2014), Manzoor G hauri Case (CP 
2133/2014), Double Shah Case (CMA 1522/2015), Asad Kharal Case (CMA 
1656/2015), Khalid Rashid Case (CMA 1556/2015),  SMC 10 of 2015  etc. 
2. On 10.07.2013 we had passed an order.  In this order we had highlighted 
what appeared to us to be  seri ous short comin gs in NAB including the way in 
which OGRA  had been dealt with by NAB.  In para 2 of the said order we had also 
noted that according to NAB an enquiry was initiated within NAB to ascertain 
whether persons within NAB or outside it had facilita ted the escape of Tauqir Sadiq 
from Pakistan even though his name appeared on the ECL and despite the fact that 
on a few relevant dates the said person was inside the NAB Headquarters but was 
not apprehended.  We ha d also noted that persons whether in the National 
Highway Police or Punjab Police or FIA/Imm igration had aided or abetted Tauqir 
Sadiq to leave Pakistan.   Apparently millions of rupees were spent in locating and 
bringing Tauqir Sadiq back to Pakistan.  
3. We are informed by the learned Prosecutor General that  with regard to th e 
matter  of OGRA  a report (CMA No. 4601/2014) was prepared by NAB in respect of 
persons within NAB  who may have been complicit in unlawful activities and 
another report ( CMA No. 4602/2014 ) in relation to persons outside of NAB.   The 
learned Prosecutor General was repeatedly asked to state his opinion as to the 
findings/conclusion s of the two reports which had ended in the finding by the 
Chairman that no further action was required , but, unfortunately, t he learned 
Prosecutor Gene ral did not proffer his own opinion as to the conclusions in the two 
reports although he was repeatedly asked to do so.  We have also noticed that in a 
number of cases which have been mentioned above, we have been asking NAB to 
furnish reports, information etc., but there has been a marked absence of diligent 
effort on the part of NAB. In many cases, prima facie, there appears to have been CMA 3325/2013 in CRP 270/2011  3 
deliberate concealment of important facts. Just to illustrate this point , we may add 
that vide order dated 1.7.2015,  a list of the biggest 150 scams was sought relating to 
financial corruption, land grapping etc. and misuse/abuse of official position. A list 
was furnished , but without giving details as to the pendency of 
inquiries/investigations and even more seriously, wit hout giving details of 29 mega 
scams which emerged at a subsequent date. Some of the scams mentioned in the list 
filed by  NAB in CMA No. 1656 of 2015 , it is apparent that a probe into the 
functioning of NAB is necessary. We may mention that NAB itself did not possess 
any monitoring and evaluation system but this matter was taken up on prodding  of 
this Court and involvement of LJCP  that a monitoring and evaluation system 
framework was prepared . There were many delays in this process on the part of 
NAB and in  fact an important component of such framework in the form of a value 
chain analysis was completely missing. Even today there are many aspects of the 
working of NAB which raise questions but to which satisfactory answers have not 
been forthcoming from NAB.  We may emphasize that  NAB has been created as a 
principal watchdog against corruption in Pakistan. Corruption is itself rightly 
perceived as ea ting into the very foundation and  vitals of society. A corruption 
watchdog which, therefore , does not function e fficiently adversely affects inter alia, 
the fundamental rights in Articles 14, 18, 19A, 23 and 24 of the Constitution.      
4. We, therefore,  in exercise of judicial powers conferred upon this Court under 
Articles 187 and 190 of the Constitution, Order XXX II, Rules 1 & 2 read with Order 
XXXIII, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 coupled with the principles of 
Civil Procedure Code including Order XXVI, Rule 10  appoint Khawaja Ahmad 
Hosain, Additional Attorney General to act as a Local Commission to exam ine the 
said two reports and submit his report with regard to whether NAB, FIA, National 
Highway Police and/or the Punjab Police had facilitated the escape of Tauqir Sadiq.  
The amount spent on bringing Tauqir Sadiq back to Pakis tan and whether such 
amount  has been realized shall also be determined.  The local commission shall  also CMA 3325/2013 in CRP 270/2011  4 
look into the performance of NAB in pursuing high profile mega scams referred to 
above and may select those which have remained pending for the longest period 
with NAB without  reaching a conclusion or filing of references . Furthermore, the 
failure of NAB to disclose full information including particulars of 29 mega scams 
subsequently identified  and  the persons/officials, if any , who may have been 
responsible for omissions/incompete nce in various cases with NAB and action, if 
any, which may have been taken against such officials. There are reported cases in 
law journals which have highlighted the acts/omissions/misdeeds of certain 
persons. These cases appear neither to have been prob ed by NAB nor does it appear 
that any action was taken in respect of such shortcomings and persons who may 
have abused their official positions.     
5. NAB, FIA, National Highway Police, Islamabad and Punjab Police and all 
other Federal and Provincial mini stries, departments, agencies, etc. shall exten d full 
cooperation to the Commission er.  Report to be submitted  on or before the next date 
of hearing, i.e. 2.9.2015.
