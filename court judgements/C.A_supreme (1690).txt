Judgment  
  Anwar Zaheer Jamali , J – On 2.2.2011 , the 
petitioners  brought Constitution Petition No. 6 of 2011 , under 
Article 184 (3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic  of 
Pakistan 1973 (“the Constitution”) , for agitating their two fold 
grievances against the Employees Old Age Benefit Institution 
(“EOBI ”), a body established under the Employees Old Age 
Benefit Act XIV of 1976  (“the Act 1976”) , and its management , 
arraying  EOBI,  the Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of 
Labour an d Manpower, M/s Zafar Iqbal Gondal , Chairman, 
EOBI, Mushtaq Samoo , Director , EOBI/ Secretary Board of 
Trustees,  Kanwar Waheed Khursheed , Director General  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  3 
(Investment) /Convener of Selection Committee -2, Muhammad 
Hanif, Officiating Directo r General/  Convener of Selection 
Committee -I and Mirza Imtiaz Ahmed , Acting Director General 
(Finance & Accounts) , Convener of Selection Committee -3, as 
respondents . The averments made in the petition  reveal  that 
the first grievance of the petitioners is regarding appointment  
of more than 2 13 persons in BPS-16 to BPS-20, as detailed in 
the petition, in a patent ly illegal manner on the basis of  
political influence, nepotism and cronyism , under the 
chairmanship of respondent No.3  (Zafar Iqbal Gondal ), in 
league with respondents No.4 to 7, while the other grievance is 
as regards large scale financial corruption and 
mismanagement of funds of the EOBI , as detailed in the 
petition. Based on such allegations, reliefs prayed for in the 
petition read as under: - 
“i)  Declare that all the  impugned appointments made in the 
Respondent No.1/EOBI are unlawful, illegal  and void ab 
initio and in violation of prescribed recruitment procedure/  
operating manual.  
ii) Declare that EOB Fund cannot be utilized or invested in 
contravention and violation o f EOB Act 1976 and EOB 
(Investment) Rules, 1979 .  
iii) Declare that any amount utilized in corrupt practices by the 
EOBI Management/Respondents and others are without 
lawful authority and the same may be recovered from the 
Respondents.  
iv) Direct that the responde nts that any Fund invested against 
the sprit of EOB Act 1976  and EOB (Investment) Rules 1979 
shall be disinvested.  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  4 
v) Grant any other relief which as deemed appropriate, just and 
proper by this Hon’ble Court in very circumstances of the 
case.”.  
2. Since  thereaf ter, during the proceedings of this 
petition, several orders of interim nature have been passed  by 
the Court , primarily , to find out the substance of these 
allegations against the respondents, whereupon several 
miscellaneous applications/ concise statements /replies and 
documents have been submitted and brought on record by the 
respondent s in an attempt to justify such appointments and to 
explain their position  as regards mismanagement of funds of 
the EOBI . In addition to it, in response to our order dated 
12.9.2013, directing publication of general notice regarding the 
present proceedings in some newspapers of wide circulation 
from Islamabad and Karachi, for information of the appointees 
of EOBI whose appointments have been challenged or who are 
likely to be affected with t he outcome of these proceedings, 
many miscellaneous application s for impleadment as party to 
these proceedings have been received from various 
groups/ individuals, who, according to their claim  are such 
appointees or  are likely to be affected  from any final outcome 
of these proceedings, which ha ve been entertained and 
allowed.  
3. Another human rights case on the same subject 
and relating to similar grievance s, bearing No. 48012 -P of 2010,  
which is  based on the complaint dated 30.9.2010 , made by Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  5 
one Tajamul Hussain has al so been tagged with this petition , 
in terms of order dated 20.4.2011, which has thus proceeded 
along with this petition . In the said human rights case, inter 
alia, illegal appointments allegedly made in EOBI  have been 
brought to th e Court’s notice and challenged on the basis of 
facts detailed in the said complaint.  
4. It seems that while proceeding s in these two 
cases were sub -judic e before the Court , with reference to a 
programme  aired through some  T.V. channel on 27.6.2013 , 
titled a s “corruption scandal of more than forty billion rupees 
in the EOBI ” on 29.6.2013 , a detailed note was submitted by 
the Registrar of the Court before the Honourable Chief Justice 
of Pakistan , unfolding therein the attribution s of the 
participants of the sa id programme against EOBI with specific 
reference to  the (i) purchase of plots in DHA, (ii) purchase of  
Crown Plaza in F -7 Markaz, Islamabad, (iii) purchase of two 
controversial plots in Sukkur, (iv) development of cricket 
ground in  Islamabad, (v) purchase  of several plots from CDA, 
(vi) purchase of forty kanals sixteen marlas land in  Lahore , (vii) 
purchase of four floors of plaza/hotel in Lahore, (viii) 
construction of seven star hotel in front of Lahore Airport , (ix) 
construction of M-9 motorway by EOBI, (x) purchase of twenty 
acres  land near Karachi Airport  in billions and (xi) purchase of  
two 4300 cc parado  jeeps  for personal use of the Chairman , 
EOBI . Taking notice of such allegations contained in the note Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  6 
of the Registrar , per order of the Honourable C hief Ju stice 
dated 29.6.2013 , it was converted into Constitution Petition 
No.35 of 2013 , which is no w separately  proceeding to probe 
into the allegations of financial corruption  and misuse of funds  
allegedly  made in the EOBI  by its management and other  high 
ranking Government officials  involved in the said scam . Since 
the issue of financial corruption  and misuse of funds etc. in 
EOBI has now been taken up separately in the s aid 
Constitution  petition of which this Court is seized , and 
proceedings are pending , we deem it appropriate to proceed 
further and adjudicate the present petition alongwith HRC 
No.48012 -P of 2010 and CMA No.5216 of 2012 , only to the 
extent of the case of the petitioners/complainant regarding 
illegal appointments in EOBI, leaving the othe r aspects relating 
to the financial corruption , misuse of funds and 
mismanagement etc. in EOBI to be excl usively dealt with in 
other Constitution petition No. 35 of 2013 .  
5. Reverting to the facts and the grounds stated in 
Constitution Petition No.6 of 2 011 a nd HRC No.48012 -P of 
2010 in this context and for their proper understanding, it will 
be useful to summarize the same as under:  
6. The petitioners in Constitutional Petition 
No.6/2011 have called in question the manner in which more 
than 213 appointments were  made in EOBI (which is said to 
form almost 40% of the total strength of its Officer cadre) Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  7 
alleging that as such appointments were made in flagrant 
violation of the prescribed recruitment pro cedure set out, inter 
alia, in Clause No. 02.05.2 of the EOBI Op erating Manual 
Chapter 2, they are therefore unlawful, illegal and liable to be 
set aside.  
7. It has been contended that in April 2009, EOBI 
advertised vacancies inviting applications to fill a large number 
of posts from grades 16 to 20 against which 23648 
applications were received and from which suitable applicants 
were to be shortlisted. It was alleged that even before 
commencement of the normal recruitment procedure, 
appointments against 132 vacancies were already finalized and 
made on the basis of politic al pressure, nepotism and 
cronyism, while some other perso ns manag ed their 
appoint ments  on deputation basis against regular posts for 
which vacancies had already been advertised.  Many  of whom 
were later absorbed as Regular Officers in vi olation o f the 
quota earmarked f or different provinces , they did not belong to. 
The petitioners have also submitted that some  lists of names 
were sent by the Personal Secretary to the Federal Minster of 
Labour and Manpower,  which were  then forwarded to the then 
Deputy Direct or General (HRD) Javed Iqbal and these persons 
were later appointed in Grade 16 and above, as opposed to 
those individuals who had applied through the advertisement. 
Moreover, as per the regulations, shortlisted candidates were Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  8 
to be called  for a written t est on the basis of the requirement of 
Operating Manual as well as the resolutions passed by the 
Board of Trustees, but this  procedure was completely ignored. 
The petitioners have been further aggrieved by the purported 
act of the respondents for allege dly issuing  back -dated 
appointment letters to various handpicked persons in order to 
avoid being in contempt of an interim order of the Peshawar 
High Court passed in Writ Petition No. 209/2010 whereby the  
respondents were restrained from issuing any appointme nt 
letters till the disposal of the said petition.  
8. The petit ioners in this case have further raised 
their finger towards the manner in which appointments were 
fast-tracked ; the committees established to interview 
applicants concluded their interviews on 1st June 2010 and 
appointment letters were issued on 2nd June 2010, indicating 
that the committee ’s recommendations were approved by 
Respondent No. 3 within one day, after which appointment 
letter s were sent  to all within  the span of one working day. The 
petitioners have also been aggrieved by the fact that these 
unlawful appointees did not provide any document s proving 
their educational qualifications etc. that had to be attached 
with each candidate’s application , subject to verification by the 
HEC. Indeed , there were apparently many appointees who  
claimed to have completed their education in 2010, where as Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  9 
the selection process called for all applications that fit ted the 
requisite educational criteria in the year  2009.  
9. In Human Rights Case No. 48012/P -2010,  
nearly identical allegations regarding irregular appointments 
have been levelled against  the respondents ( EOBI ). It has been 
forcefully alleged that the recruitments were made in a mala -
fide manner whereby those individuals who had links with 
politically influential persons within the then ruling PPP 
government were appointed. The  petitioner reiterated and drew 
court ’s attention towards the fact that all posts had been filled 
without completion of the requirement of written tests which is 
against the EOBI recruitment procedure. Moreover,  the then 
Chairman EOBI, Mr.  Zafar  Iqbal  Gondal, was also accused of 
making a large number of appointments   from the elected 
constituencies  of his elder brother,  Mr. Nazar  Muhammad 
Gondal, former Federal Minister of Food and  Agricultur e, 
District Mandi  Bahauddin  and Mr. Nadeem Afzal Chann, MNA 
(NA 64 Sargodha) sitting Chairman, PAC , on the basis of 
nepotism  and corruption .  
10. In addition to it , another action regarding the 
purported  irregular  appointment of Mr. Raja Azeem -ul-Haq 
Minhas, as Executive Director, World Bank has been 
challenged through  CMA No 5216/2012  in Constitutional 
Petition No. 6/2011. In this regard, n otice was taken by the 
Court after certain news reports highlighting the issues Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  10 
surrounding his appointment , pro motion, deputation etc.  It 
was contended that he did not have the requisite experience or 
qualifications for the job and was appointed Executive Director 
in the World Bank due to political pressure as he was son -in-
law of the then Pr ime Minster, Raja Perve z Ashraf  at the time 
of his appointment  to the World Bank . A look at his service 
record reveals that Mr. Minhas was serving as Senior Joint 
Secretary on a grade 21 post because of out of turn promotions 
received by him due to his personal affiliations with  persons 
who held high political office s, otherwise he was  an officer of 
the income tax group, working in grade 18 when the PPP 
government came into power. He left this post and was hired 
by the EOBI in grade 20 on 2.6.2010 and then went on to hold 
the Act ing Charge of the post of Director General on BS 21 
from 15.02.2012 till 23.05.2012 , after which he assumed the 
post of Senior Joint Secretary on deputation basis at the Prime 
Minster Secretariat. To examine these aspects , on 21.2.2013  
notices were ordered  to be sent to the Establishment Division, 
Federation of Pakistan to furnish details regarding his 
appointment to the World Bank. However, d uring the course of 
such proceedings  on 6.6.2013  he resigned from the post of 
Executive Director , World Bank . Nevert heless, his appointment 
in EOBI pursuant to the aforesaid advertisement or otherwise 
is to be examined like other cases of appointment in order to Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  11 
see whether there was any illegality or irregularity attached to 
it or it was made in a transparent manner on  merit  criteria .  
11.           It will be pertinent to mention here that in 
their detailed reply earlier submitted by respondent No.1, 
though they conced ed to certain material illegalities/  
irregularities committed in the proc ess of appointment s by the 
manage ment of EOBI, still they attempted to defend and justif y 
these appointments on the pretext that all individuals were 
appointed on the basis of recruitment procedure laid down in 
the relevant rules and regulations. However, due to the 
qualification s of some  candidates and urgency in the matter 
regarding filling up the vacant seats, candidates were only 
called for interviews, without written test . Such a decision, it 
was submitted , was not contrary to rule regulation or earlier 
practice of the EOBI and that i t was settled law that a practice 
followed persistently by a department itself takes the place of a 
‘rule’. Furthermore, according to the ‘Investment Personnel 
(Contract Appointment) Regulations, 2007 issued by the Board 
of Trustees u/s 45 of the Act , it allows selection committees to 
conduct “interviews or tests” .  Moreover the respondents 
strongly challenged the maintainability of the petition,  
protesting that the petitioner had neither pointed towards any 
fundamental right that was being adversely affect ed, nor the 
core requirement of “public interest”  was fulfilled as the issue  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  12 
revolved around a restricted group of persons  appointed in the 
EOBI  and not in respect of the nation or the public at large.   
12. We have heard the arguments of learned ASC s, 
who are  representing different parties to  these proceedings as 
well as for the intervener s, and with their assistance carefully 
perused the bulky c ase record of these proceedings. As called 
upon by the  Court, the petitioner  Syed Mubasshar Raza 
Jaffery in Const. P . No.6 of 2011 and Mr. Tajammal Hussain in 
HRC No.48012 -P of 2010  made their respective submissions 
only to the extent of allegations of illegal appointments in 
EOBI , which are in line with the contentions raised in their 
respective petitions. In this rega rd, they further made reference 
to several  documents as well as  applicable service/  
appointment  rules and regulations of EOBI, which were 
daringly  and dishonestly  circumvented and violated by the 
officials of EOBI, at the helm of the affairs at the relevan t time . 
The pith and substance of their arguments was that whatever 
grievances they have voiced in the present proceedings , those 
has been fully substantiated and corroborated from the 
document s produced by them and  the report of fact finding 
committee on  recruitment/appointments constituted by the 
present management of EOBI , has remained undisputed/  
uncontroverted , rather conceded by the learned ASC for the 
official respondents Mr. Saiful Malook, Mirza Waqas Rauf, 
D.A.G. for the Federation of Pakistan and even learned ASC s Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  13 
for the interven ers ha ve not ventured to say much to the  
contrary  regarding  the authenticity of such report, except that 
all this has happened due to change in the management of 
EOBI . 
13. Mr. Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, learned Sr. ASC for 
the int erveners  during his argument s firstly stressed upon the 
humanitarian aspect of the case. According to him it will be 
highly unjust, unfair and  harsh  that in case these petitions are 
allowed so many appointees in the EOBI, who have been 
performing well to t he satisfaction of the institution  for many 
years , for no fault on their part, will now be removed from 
service and rendered jobless. More particularly, in the 
circumstances when already percentage of unemployment in 
the country has reached at  a very high level, which is resulting 
in sheer frustration amongst the educated class of the country.  
He, however , seriously questioned the maintainability of th e 
petition and H.R.C. within the ambit of Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution. According to him, such course , if followed by the 
Court, will negate the vested rights of the appointees with 
reference to Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution, which 
ensures that every citizen is to be dealt with in accordance 
with law and has a right to fair trial. In support of h is 
submissions, he placed reliance on the cases of Managing 
Director, SSGC Ltd. Versus Ghulam Abbas  (PLD 2003 S.C. 
724) and All Pakistan Newspapers Society versus Federation of Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  14 
Pakistan  (PLD 2004 S.C. 600) . In the 1st case the apex Court 
dealt with hundre ds of petitions of the employees of Sui 
Southern Company Limited in relation to their service dispute 
and in that context also considered the question of 
discrimination on the yardstick of Article 25 of the 
Constitution and scope of review  under Article 18 8 of the 
Constitution . As a result the review petitions were allowed and 
cases were remanded to the Federal Service Tribunal for 
decision of their dispute afresh. In the 2nd case, broad 
principles for invoking  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under 
Articl e 184(3) of the Constitution were discussed. It was held 
that it provided an expeditious and inexpensive remedy for 
protection of fundamental rights from legislative and executive 
interference, particularly, in a situation when there is no other 
adequate r emedy and that question of public importance with 
reference to enforcement of fundament rights was involved. 
With these observations, the petition under Article 184(3) of 
the Constitution, challenging the vires of 7th Wage Board 
Award was held not maintain able, as the said award was only 
valid to the extent of working journalists and did not a ffect the 
public at large qua fundamental right of speech under Article 
19 of the Constitution.  
14. In the end Mr. Abdul Hafeez Pirzada  reiterated 
his submission that for  the sake of smooth functioning of the 
institution (EOBI) and to save the families of such appointees Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  15 
from starvation, a lenient view of the matter may be taken as 
regards the purported irregularities in their appointments. 
However, those responsible for s uch illegalities may be 
separately taken to task in accordance with law.  
15. We have given due consideration to the 
submissions of the learned Sr. ASC,  relating to exercise of our 
jurisdiction under Articl e 184 (3) of the C onstitution , but are in 
disagreement with him for the reason that the controversy 
involved in the present petition and connected human rights 
case is clearly within the domain of public interest litigation 
qua violation of fundamental rights of citizen s at large by a 
public body (EOBI)  in the  matter of selection and 
appointments . In such circumstances, it is the respondent 
No.1 EOBI, whose affairs are being probed and looked into by 
the Court and not the individual grievance by or against the 
appointees, who may be the affectees of the ultimat e decision 
of the Court in these proceedings. As a matter of fact, on 
12.9.2013 order for publication of general notice regarding the 
pendency of these proceedings was passed by this Court in 
order to afford an opportunity of hearing to the appointees of 
EOBI, whose appointments are under challenge in these 
proceedings or who are likely to be affected with the outcome 
of these proceedings . It was for this reason that office was 
directed to publish a general notice in few newspaper s of wide 
circulation from Islamabad and Karachi, apprising all such Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  16 
employees of EOBI about th e pendency of these proceedings  so 
that in case, anyone of them has any interest in the fate of 
these proceedings, may appear and contest the matter. Thus, 
it was in the larger interest of  justice and for the above reason 
that all the applications of interven ers, who are more than 190 
in number, were entertained and oppor tunity of hearing was 
allowed. O therwise, they had no independent right to 
participate in the proceedings of this case or  to allege violation 
of Articles 4 & 10A of the Constitution  in their individual 
cases . If any case law is needed to fortify this view, reference 
can be made to the case of Sindh High Court Bar Association 
versus  Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2009 S.C. 879 ), wherein  
the Court while expounding upon the ambit of Article 184 (3) 
settled the law by stating that it is now a well -entrenched 
principle that the breach of fundamental rights of a “ class of 
persons, who collectively suffer due to such breach, and ther e 
does not seem to be any possible relief being granted from any 
quarter due to their inability to seek or obtain relief, … are 
entitled to file petition under Article 184(3 )”. Such a view lends 
full support to the maintainability of the petition as the 
grievance in hand concerns the rights of more than 23,127 
applicants whose applications were passed over due to 
nepotism and political pressure , in contravention of  their  
fundamental rights enshrined under the Constitution,  which 
in turn also affects the pub lic at large as it calls into question Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  17 
the manner in which the bureaucratic system is being abused 
by the ruling elite. Such a view i s also supported by another 
case of Syed Mahmood Akthar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan,  
(PLD 2013 SC 195 ) where in the Cour t held that as the issue 
under examination concerned political pressure placed on the 
civil service by the executive, the petition was maintainable 
under Article 184(3) as it relates to the infringement of 
fundamental rights of civil servants under Article  9, 14 and 18 
of the Constitution. It was recognized as being an issue of 
public importance as the civil service is deemed to be an 
essential component of the executive arm of the state.  Yet 
another judgment  of five member  Bench of this Court, which 
suppor ts the maintainability of this petition under Article 
184(3) of the Constitution , is in H.R.C. No.40927 -S of 2012  
regarding pensionary bene fits of the Judges of Superior C ourts  
(PLD 2013 S.C. 829) , wherein combined effect of Articles 
184(3), 187 and 188 of  the Constitution has been dilated with 
the observation that the apex Court has unlimited  jurisdiction 
to set the law correct,  to cure injustice , save it from becoming 
an abuse of the process of law and the judicial system and for 
this pass any order to f oster the cause of justice; eliminating 
the chances of perpetuating illegality and to save an aggrieved 
party  from being rendered remediless. Thus we have no doubt 
about the maintainability of this petition and the human rights 
case and the arguments of learned Sr. ASC  Mr. Pirzada as Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  18 
regard s the limited scope of Article 184(3) of Constitution are 
devoid of force.  
16. M/s Sardar M. Aslam and  Athar Minallah, two 
other learned ASC s for some  other  appointees/ respondents in 
these proceedings, ha ve adopted the argum ents of Mr. Pirzada 
with their additional submission s that in case an  adverse order 
is passed against the appointees , whose appointments have 
been assailed in these two ca ses, their future will be ruined, 
therefore, a via media may be sorted out to accommo date them 
at their jobs  or atleast in the fresh process of selection and 
appointments in the EOBI .  
17. Ch. Afrasiab Khan, learned ASC for Raja 
Azeem -ul-Haq Minhas has made reference to various replies 
submitted on his behalf in response to C.M.A. No.5216 of 
2012, whi ch has been heard together with these petitions and 
contended that since during the pendency of these proceedings  
on 6.6.2013 he has resigned from his post in the World Bank, 
therefore, any further  action against him would not be 
justified. However , as regards the irregularities highlighted by 
the petitioner s in the appointment of Raja Azeem -ul-Haq 
Minhas in the EOBI qua his rapid promotion s and deputation  
etc., he insisted that the re is no such procedural lapse in this 
regard, which can be te rmed a s illegal or mala -fide. Mere fact 
that he is son -in-law of the then Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz 
Ashraf cannot be taken as his disqualification to hold such Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  19 
high post s or get rapid promotions  as it was done solely on 
merit criteria . However, he did not argu e much as to the 
manner of his  appointment  and frequent promotions in the 
EOBI  as mentioned in the report of fact finding committee, 
which also forms part of this judgment .  
18. Conversely, Mr. Saiful Malook, learned ASC for 
respondents No.1 to 3, has uprightl y supported the case of 
petitioners as regards hundreds of illegal appointments made 
in the EOBI during the period from January, 2009 to May 
2012  and onwards, which are now under challenge  in these 
two petitions  or subject matter of contempt proceedings 
regarding other appointments made in EOBI during the 
pendency of these proceedings . He candidly stated that the 
earlier reply to these petitions submitted on behalf of EOBI 
was based on concocted facts and managed  at the behest of 
the then Chairman, EOBI, wh o though t that he was above all 
laws of the land. He made reference to several documents, 
particularly, the lists of illegal appointees given in the memo of 
these petitions and the detail ed report of fact finding 
committee on recruitment/a ppointments to sh ow that how the 
practice of nepotism, corruption and political exigencies was 
rampantly followed in a mala -fide manner for making such 
illegal appointments. To sum up , he stated that all illegal 
appointments challenged in these proceedings or otherwise 
made during the pendency of these proceedings may be set Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  20 
aside and directions be issued to the management of EOBI for 
undertaking this exercise afresh in a transparent manner 
strictly in accordance with the rules and regulations of 
appointment and on merits.  
19. Detailed facts re corded in the preceding 
paragraphs of this judgment, particularly, with reference to the 
undisputed document s gain full support from the report of fact 
finding  committee on rec ruitment/appointments  submitted by 
respondent No.1 bef ore the Court on 28.8.2013. T herefore,  
before proceeding further it will be useful to reproduce the

under judicial scrutiny of  the Hon’able Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in constitutional petition No.6 of 2011 and Human Rights Case

2. In order to firm -up its position in the matter subjudice before 
the apex court and to examine the process of recruitment adopted 
in the Institution during the last three years, the new management 
of EOBI decided to carry out a fact finding exercise. A Committee 
comprising of the following officers was constituted to ascertain the 
facts of the recruitment made by the Institution durin g these years 
commencing from January 2009 vide Office Order No.259/2013 
dated 25.7.2013 (Annex -I). The Committee was required to indicate

been framed under Section 45 of EOB Act, 1976 and notified 
vide S.R.O. 413(1)/81 of Ministry of Labour, Manpower and

provisions of the Operating Manual (clause 02.4.3)  approved 
in 64th meeting of the Board of Trustees held on 09.05.2003 
regulate Recruitment in EOBI.  
4. History of recruitment in EOBI reveals that whenever 
appointments to the posts of Executive Officer (Grade -
6/BPS -16) & Assistant Director (Grade -07/BPS -17) had been 
made, written tests of the shortlisted candidates had been 
done. In 2007 written tests were held to short list the 
applicants even for the post of Deputy Director (Finance) in 
view of the large number of applications received for the 
posts so adve rtised.  
5. From the records maintained in HR Department, EOBI 
Head Office, Karachi, it was observed that following 
recruitments had been carried out during the relevant 
period.  
A.      Recruitment of 132 officers in June 2010 as per 
advertisement of 16.4.2009 (Annex -II) 
B.      Recruitment by Absorption of seven (07) 
deputationist in March 2010 (Annex -III). 
C.     Contract Appointment of 238 officials and their 
subsequent regularization by the Cabinet sub -
committee from Sept 2011 to May 2012.  
A. Recruitment of 132 Of ficers:  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  22 
6. It has been observed that the Institution (EOBI) called 
for applications through public notice published in leading 
newspapers on 16.4.2009  to fill up 213 vacant posts of 
officers and staff. Applications for the advertised posts were 
called through  a Web -Portal specifically hosted for the 
purpose besides through P.O Box as per convenience of the 
applicants. (Annex -II).  
7. As per record of the IT Department, which was 
managing the data of applicants, 23,137 applications (officers -
19,195), staff -3,942) were received through post and e -mail. 
17,979 applications were received by the cut -off date 
(15.5.2009)  by web portal, whereas data entry of 5,158 
applications received by post was completed by 14th July, 
2009. After necessary filtration, data of 21,236 ( officers -
17,569 and staff -3,667) (Annex -IV) emerged to be referred as 
the “Original List”  in the report subsequently. Post wise 
break -up of the applications received is detailed as under: - 
i. Dy. Director General     124 
ii. Director (Ops)      158 
iii. Director (Law)       48

8. While the HR Depa rtment in close liaison with IT 
Department (Annex -V) was gearing up to further process the 
recruitment against 132 posts of Officers, the EOBI 
management was changed. Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed Samo 
assumed additional charge of the Head of H R Department in 
additio n to his own duties as Secretary BoT. Complete data 
file was handed over to Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed Samo who 
under supervision of Dr. Imtiaz, then Special Assistant to the 
Chairman further processed the recruitment. Short -listing of 
the candidates were not done by the relevant Departmental 
Selection Committees. Three different Selection Committees 
were notified for conducting interviews for the posts of 
Executive Officers, Assistant Directors and Deputy Directors 
for all cadres viz. Operations, Office, Finance, I T and Law on 
geographical basis. Whereas, EOBI Recruitment Procedures 
prescribe one standing Departmental Selection Committees 
for each Cadre. (Annex -VI). Therefore, seven selection 
committees were required to be constituted for conducting 
interviews for t he posts of Executive Officer, Assistant 
Director & Deputy Director in Operation/Office, Finance, I.T. 
and Law Cadres and for Director (Law), Director (Operations) 
and Deputy Director General (Operations).  
9. Written Test for short listing of the large numbe r of 
applications as detailed above should have been held as per 
practice and as required under clause 02.5.2.1(b) of the 
Operating Manual (Annex -VII). However, the recruitment 
process was finalized without any such written tests for the 
positions of Dy. D irector/Assistant Director/Executive 
Officer and offers of appointment were issued (Annex -VIII). 
The whole process was completed by 01.06.2010.  
10. Number of applications at the time of interview 
subsequently risen to 23,648 (Annex -IX). No record of call 
letters issued was maintained and original evaluation sheet 
(grade assessment) filled by the members of the Selection 
Committees were not preserved and p laced on records to 
scrutinize/ authenticate average marking prepared for 
appointments. Similarly police veri fication and medical tests 
of the appointed persons were not carried out in most of the 
cases.  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  24 
11. Scrutiny of the records reveal that 132 appointment 
letters were issued on 02.06.2010 to various persons across 
Pakistan on 01.06.2010 perhaps to escape from th e injunctive 
order dated 02.06.2010, passed by the Peshawar High Court, 
Abbottabad Bench in writ petition No.209/2009 (Annex -X) 
restraining EOBI to issue appointment letter to any person. 
These appointment letters had been sent without any 
dispatch numbers  and entering into the register for record 
maintenance and tracking.  
12. Scrutiny of the records, relevant files and data 
submitted by IT Department during the process of 
recruitment, the Committee observed that a number of 
discrepancies/irregularities in the  process of recruitment were 
carried out in these appointments. Defective short -listing 
owing to which candidates having un -matched/irrelevant 
qualifications, acquiring qualification after appointment, 
deficient post qualification experience, over -age and without 
required domiciles were entertained as indicated below:  
i. Unmatched/irrelevant qualifications:  21 cases  
ii. Acquiring qualifications after appointments :  29 cases  
iii. Deficient post qualification experience:  8 cases  
iv. Over age:      21 cases  
B. Recruitment by absorption of seven (07) 
deputationists in March 2010.  
  
13. Seven officials working on deputation in Grade -03, 
06 & 07 as Assistant, Executive Officer and Assistant 
Director respectively were absorbed in EOBI w.e.f. 30th 
March 2010 vide Office Order No.53/2010 (Annex -III). It was 
observed that while absorbing these deputationists 
requirement of provincial/regional quota was not observed. It 
was also noted that in one case qualification prescribed for 
the post was also not observed.  
C. Contract Appointment of 238 officials on 
contract/daily wages/contingent basis/internee & 
their subsequent regularization by the Cabinet sub -
committee from September 2011 to May 2012:  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  25 
14. The appointments of 238 employees ranging from 
Grade 01 to Grade 09 on contract b asis were carried out in 
violation of the rules and procedures. In certain cases of 
appointments there were no vacant position/post at the 
time of appointment as well as at the time of 
regularization.  Besides observance of prescribed quota and 
required qua lification as per rules had also been 
compromised.  
15. Recruitment rules/procedures (Annex -XI) empowers 
the Chairman EOBI to create temporary posts for a period of 
six (06) months only, however, filling up of these post needed 
observance of procedure prescrib ed by the rules. It has been 
observed that these temporary posts were meant for a period 
of six months only but these were extended beyond six 
months till their regularization by the Cabinet sub -committee 
vide its notifications (Annex -XII). However, it is to be further 
examined whether the infirmities as indicated above were 
cured/regularized by Cabinet Sub -Committee’s decision or 
otherwise.  
Conclusion:  
16. In view of the above findings it is concluded that 
prescribed rules and procedures were not followed whi le 
making the above recruitment/appointment in EOBI. Equal 
opportunities were not provided to all aspirants for the 
appointments in EOBI by not holding were test, not 
constituting appropriate selection committees and making 
compromises on qualifications et c. Thus, principles of fair 
play, transparency and rules of natural justice/equity were 
compromised.

20.  The above unanimous report prepared by a six 
Member  high powered committee, constituted by the Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  26 
management of EOBI speaks volume s about the 
mismanagement, corruption, nepotism and politicising of the 
disputed appointments in a mala -fide manner , thereby  
crushing the merit crite ria in a public owned establishment  of 
the Government. It is extremely sad that despite the guidelines 
given by the apex Court in a series of judgments with reference 
to fundamental  rights guaranteed to each citizen of this 
country in terms of Articles 4, 9 & 25  of the C onstitution , qua 
selection and appointments in government service and public 
owned corporations and institutions, many person s like the 
then Chairman , did not  realize  or adhere to the reality of merit 
criteria and were  adamant to play with the future  of the 
younger generation  for their own good  and to achieve their 
nefarious design s. Though t here is ample mate rial available on 
record , inter alia,  in the form of detaile d list of hand picked 
appointees , reproduced in paragraph 14 of th e memo of 
petition No.6 of 2011 , and several others such lists placed on 
record of connected human rights case , containing large 
number of names of politicians, elected members  of the 
Nation al and Provincial Assemblies, Ministers and other 
persons of so called elite class  in the country,  however, we 
have purposely refrain ed from reproducing such lists to avoid 
expos ing these persons at this stage as it may scandalize them 
or otherwise cause p rejudice to their interest.  But as a test

Thus, to cut the long story short, the re spondents and the 
interveners have nothing wi th them to defend these palpable 
illegalities in the process of appointments .  
21.  A careful examination of the whole record appended 
with these petition s, in particular the detailed order dated 
25.3.2011, ther eby taking cognizance of these allegations of 
corruption in the matter of appointments in EOBI , under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution , and various subsequent 
orders passed in this case, go to show that ample opportunity 
was allowed to the respondents to  defend their misdeeds in Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  30 
this regard, but to no avail, rather in the form of the report of 
the fact finding committee on recruitment /appointment , as 
reproduced above , eventually the respondents have conceded 
to the case of the petitioners in this regard, we, therefore, need 
no further deliberations and reasons to undo such wrongs and 
illegalities. If any case law is need ed to fortify our view, a 
reference can be made to the following cases: - 
 (1) Muhammad Yasin  versus Federation of Pakistan  
  (PLD 2012 S.C . 132)  
 (2) Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana  versus Pakistan  
  (2013 SCMR 1159)  
 
 (3) Tariq Aziz -ud-Din: in re  (2010 SCMR 1301)  
 
 (4) Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi versus Federation of  
  Pakistan (PLD 2013 S.C. 195)  
 
(5) Contempt proceedings against Chief Secretary,                 
Sindh and others (2013 SCMR 1752) . 
 
22. In the 1st case of Muhammad Yasin  (supra)  
the appointment of Chairman Oil and Gas Regulatory 
Authority (OGRA) was declared illegal . In the 2nd case of 
Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana  (supra) the appointment of the 
Chairm an Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP) was held to be in contravention to statutory 
requirements. Both these cases reiterated the principle that 
appointments made in a statutory body or Corporation under 
the control of Provincial or Feder al Government  in an arbitrary 
and capricious manner cannot be allowed to hold the field. In 
the 3rd case of Tariq Aziz -ud-Din (supra) this Court Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  31 
underscored the integral link between good governance and a 
strong and honest bureaucracy. It was stated that t his could 
only come about if appointments made were based on a clear 
merit criterion, in accordance with the relevant laws and rules 
as opposed to favouritism and nepotism.  In the 4th case of 
Syed Mahmood Akthar Naqvi  (supra)  the Supreme Court , 
examining t he issue of political pressure placed on the civil 
service by the executive, held that the matter was one of public 
importance as such undue influence by political powers 
infringed the fundamental rights  under Article s 9, 14, 18 and 
25 of the Constitution.  In the 5th case, which  is a more recent 
judgment of this Court, relating to contempt proceedings 
against the Chief Secretary Sindh and others  (2013 SCMR 
1752), wherein, inter alia,  vires of certain legislative 
instruments introduced by the Sindh Governmen t regarding 
regularization and absorption of civil servants (particular ly, in 
the police department) was  under scrutiny/ challenge, the 
Court examined all the relevant asp ects of the case in detail 
and expressed  its view s about the maintainability of petiti ons, 
absorption, deputation, out of turn promotions and 
reemployment  in Government service qua their  subsequent 
validation through some legislative instrument s; principle of 
locus poenitentiae and effect of such legislation attempting to 
nullify the effect  of the judgments of the Superior Courts. In 
this regard, while striking down these pieces of legislation, Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  32 
being contrary to the spirit of Articles 240 and 242 of the 
Constitution and various provisions of Sindh Civil Servants Act 
1973, it laid down severa l guiding principles. The pri nciple of 
law propounded in th is judgment, with reference to many 
other earlier judgments of the Apex Court, lend full support to 
the case of the present petitioners, as regards illegal 
appointments, contract appointments, abso rptions and their 
regularization  etc., particularly, when these acts are motivated 
to frustrate and nullify some earlier judgments/orders of the 
Superior Court  in a dishonest, colourful and mala -fide 
manner, as discussed in the  earlier part of this  judgmen t and 
hereinafter.  All the cases discussed above reveal that the 
jurisprudence of this Court has been c lear and consistent with 
regard  to the manner in which appointments to public offices 
are to be made  strictly in accordance with applicable rules and 
regulations, without any discrimination and in a transparent 
manner. Thus , it is essential that all appointments to public 
institutions must be based on a process that is palpably and 
tangibly fair and within the parameter s of its applicable rules, 
regulation s and bye -laws. B ut conversely , it is a sad fact of our 
bureaucracy that it can be so susceptible to the whims and 
wishes of the ruling elite  class etc, which  results in an obvious 
weakening of state institutions such as the EOBI, whereby the 
general publi c, whose interest such establishments have been Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  33 
charged with pr otecting, are adversely and heavi ly affected  in 
different ways .  
23. Indeed , if we allow these petitions substantial 
hardship is likely to be caused to many of the respondents/  
appointees who will lose their appointment /jobs because of the 
illegalities i n their respective appointments  committed by 
EOBI , but the fact remains that such ill -gotten gains cannot be 
defended/protected under any cannon of law or even on 
humanitarian  considerations , as, suc h gains availed by the  
illegal appointees were at the cost of other deserving 
candidates who ha d applied for these posts , being citizen s of 
this country , with a legitimate expectation that they would be 
able to seek appointment on the basis of their eligib ility-cum-
merit criteria to be observed as per the applicable rules and 
regulations  of the EOBI. From the material available on record, 
it is crystal clear that even the respondents in EOBI against 
whom allegation s of nepotism, corruption and mala -fide hav e 
been levelled have offered no legitimate defence except to say 
that such exercise may be protected for the benefit  of 
appointees . Similar is the position in the case of appointment  
of Raja Azeem -ul-Haq Minhas , as evident from the material 
placed on recor d, which shows that how after his resignation 
from a post in BS -18 in the Income Tax Group, he jumped  in 
the EOBI , got appointment and promotions from one step to 
another to reach BS -21 within a short period of three years. Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  34 
We have specifically asked Chaud hry Afrasiab Khan, learned 
ASC to show us any provision of law, whereby an employee of 
the institution like EOBI can be appointed on deputation in 
the Prime Minister Secretariat as Joint Secretary (BS -20) and 
within no time of his coming back , promoted as Director 
General (BS -21), but he h ad no plausible answer to such 
query. As a matter of fact, looking to the material available on 
record, the discussion about illegal appointment s in the EOBI, 
made in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment is a drop in 
the bucket what has exactly happened in th is whole process 
during the year 2009 and thereafter  from time to time . 
24. Having discussed as above, another important 
aspect of the case, which needs serious consideration is about 
the fate of the illegal appointees , which is subject matter of 
consideration in the present proceedings. If we look at this 
aspect of the case from the angle of those who have succeeded 
to get appointments in the manner, as discussed above, some 
of them may claim that since they met the re quisite 
qualifications for the posts and were thus appointed, they 
cannot be made to suffer due to illegalities committed by the 
management of EOBI. However, when we pl ace their cases for 
appointment  in juxtaposition to the other applicants, who had 
applie d for these vacancies and are 23648 in number, we find 
that these candidates having equal right of opportunity as 
citizens of this country , in terms of Article 25 of the Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  35 
Constitution were thrown out of the competition despite the 
fact that they also met th e requisite qualifications and might 
have been more meritorious , but could not exert either political 
pressure or avail the fruits of nepotism and corruption , 
forming basis for the selection and appointment of other 
candidates , many of whom ha d not even ap plied for the job in 
terms of the advertisement for these vacancies made in the 
month of April, 2009, and in this manner they succeeded in 
getting entry from the backdoor at the cost of many other 
bona -fide candidates, whose applications were literally thrown 
in the dust bin in an un -ceremonial manner just for the sake 
of accommodating the blue eyed ones. All these factors, are 
over and above the violation of rules, regulation and other 
codal formalities  meant  for these appointments, inter alia,  
highlighted  by the fact finding committee on recruitment/  
appointment in its report, which is a serious subject for the 
reason that it is based on examination of the entire  original  
record of such proceedings of appointments , right from the 
date of publication of adv ertisement regarding these vacancies , 
and till date none has come forward to question the 
impartiality of the committee or the authenticity and  
correctness of such report. In these circumstances, in our 
opinion, if the appointment of any single appointee d uring this 
process is protected on one or the other pretext or for any  
other  consideration it will amount  to protecting their ill-gotten Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  36 
gains, acquired through unlawful means,  and to perpetuate 
corruption and discrimination under the disguise of 
sympathet ic cons ideration for such appointees f or the sake of 
their economic well being.  
25. In the same context, we have also considered 
as to whether the appointees in the  EOBI, who may be the 
ultimate a ffectees of this judgment’s fall out, could be allowed 
to partic ipate in the fresh process of selection and 
appointment s in terms of this order? Our answer to this 
question is twofold. Firstly, though the appointments of these  
persons  have been challenged under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution within the ambit of pub lic interest litigation and  
none of other applicants, who were more than 23127 in 
numbers, ha s come forward to agitate/ assert his own 
individual grievance before the Court , nevertheless, their legal 
and Constitutional rights have been widely infringed at t he 
hands of the then management of EOBI. Thus, even in their 
absence their interest is to be equally safeguarded  on the 
principle of justice  and fair play; secondly, it may amount to 
giving a premium to the appointees coming from the backdoor 
if we allow t heir participation in the forthcoming process of 
appointment in the EOBI as a special case. In these 
circumstances, we d eem it proper to leave it open f or the 
management of EOBI to decide the qu estion of participation of 
the a ffectees of this judgment in t he fresh/new process of Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  37 
selection and appointment s in the affirmative or otherwise. But 
in case decision of the management of EOBI is in the 
affirmative, it will be implementable only in the situation when 
the record of other applicants in response to the earlier 
advertisement of April, 2009 etc., is intact with them and they 
are also allowed equal opportunity of participation. To put it in 
other words, in case the management of EOBI decides to allow 
all those applicants who have submitted their application s in 
response to the advertisement made in April, 2009 or 
thereafter, which as per report of the fact finding committee 
are more th an 23,127 in numbers, then the a ffectees of this 
judgment will also be entitled for similar treatment. Needless to 
observe th at for the process of selection and appointment s as 
per criteria fixed by the management of EOBI fresh 
applications will also be invited and processed in a transparent 
manner without any discrimination, on requisite merit criteria 
for each post.  
26. Another as pect of the case, which needs 
further examination, is the appointment of 238 employees/  
officials in the EOBI on contract/daily and contingency basis 
during the period September, 2011 to May, 2012  and their 
purported regularization . In this regard, apart f rom the 
material placed on record by the petitioners alongwith the 
contempt application in HRC No.49012 -P of 2010, duly 
accompanied with requisite documents in support thereof, Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  38 
there is also the report of the fact finding committee on 
recruitment/  appointm ent, reproduced above, which goes to 
show that these 238 employees in Grade -1 to Grade -9 were 
initially appointed on contract basis and for this purpose 
procedure prescribed under the rules and regulations of 
respondent EOBI was again flagrantly and ruthle ssly violated. 
Not only this, subsequently, in a colourable and mala -fide 
manner, for their regularization some  summar ies were  floated  
and their illegal approval was obtained from the Cabinet  Sub-
Committee , which otherwise neither  figures anywhere in the 
hierarchy of EOBI nor has any legal authority to rectify such 
illegal, wrong  and corrupt practice  of appointments . It is 
strange to notice that these appointments we re made at a time 
when there were  no available posts for these persons and this 
whole exerci se was , on the face of it, undertaken on the basis 
of nepotism and political pressure in vogue during that period. 
The learned ASC for the respondent EOBI and the D.A.G. have 
not defended this action, while the learned ASCs representing 
some of these appoi ntees have also not been able to satisfy this 
Court that how the  Cabinet  Sub -committee can intervene in 
the functioning of the EOBI and commit such illegality in 
violation of its rules and regulations to protect these illegal 
appointments  or to bless them with any form of legitimacy . In 
addition to it, it is also pertinent to mention that all this 
exercise was undertaken by the respondents despite specific Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  39 
stay order issued by this Court on 21.1.2011, which reads as 
follows: - 
“Mr. Tajammal Hussain son of Kh adim Hussain, Senior 
Assistant, EOBI has moved an application to Honourable 
Chief Justice of Pakistan alleging serious allegations qua 
fresh recruitments made by the Chairman, EOBI in flagrant 
violation of the prevalent rules, regulations and policy.  
2. After having gone through the entire record furnished by 
the complainant as well as press clippings (Daily News & 
Jang), wherein all the necessary details qua each of the new 
appointee have been furnished. We are tentatively of the view 
that prima facie the pr escribed procedure was never followed 
and for the sake of arguments if it is admitted that there is 
no prescribed procedure, the principles of natural justice 
have been violated ruthlessly. It is worth mentioning that on 
15.5.2009, applications were called  against 250 vacant 
vacancies in EOBI. It is amazing that no short listing could 
be made, no interview or written test whatsoever was got 
conducted, but on the contrary the vacant vacancies have 
been distributed under political pressure and to oblige the 
people of ‘Mandi Bahauddin’ which is the constituency of the 
Chairman.  
3. Chairman, EOBI is present and has attempted to justify 
his actions but failed to point out that under which provision 
of the law of Employees’ Old Age Benefit Act, 1976 (in short 
EOBI Ac t) he was competent to make all such appointments, 
including appointments on contract basis that too from 
Mandi Bahauddin. It is conceded that no advertisement was 
made for contract appointments as the nature whereof was 
ad-hoc and temporary.  
4. Be as it may , it appears that every appointment has 
been made in a reckless, careless and irresponsible manner 
without adhering to the relevant procedure and provisions of 
law enumerated in the EOBI Act and rules/regulations made 
there under. The explanation furnished  by the Chairman, 
EOBI and Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Manpower is Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  40 
unsatisfactory. However, in the interest of justice matter is 
adjourned enabling the Chairman, EOBI and Secretary, 
Ministry of Labour and Manpower to furnish a concise 
statement indic ating all the details qua appointments made 
pursuant to the advertisement appeared in various 
newspapers, whereby applications were invited on 15.5.2009 
or otherwise. The details regarding appointments made on 
contract basis shall also be furnished. Entire  record 
regarding above mentioned appointments shall be produced 
on the next date of hearing. Chairman, EOBI and Secretary, 
Ministry Labour and Manpower may also furnish additional 
documents, if need be, before the next date of hearing. 
Similarly, the comp lainant is also at liberty to file additional 
documents. It is, however, directed that till disposal of this 
human rights case, no more appointment shall be made by 
the Chairman EOBI, Secretary Ministry of Labour and 
Manpower and at the direction of concer ned Minister.  Matter 
adjourned and shall be treated as part heard. To come up on 
8.2.2011.”. (underlining given for emphasis)  
Obviously, in such circumstances all the appointments made in 
violation of the directions/order of this Court are nullity in the e yes 
of law, thus, cannot be blessed with any legitimacy or protection 
under any canon of law. As a matter of fact, this matter would 
require further probe into these allegations in the context of 
violation of the stay order dated 21.1.2011. To sum -up, the 238 
appointments, separately referred to and discussed in the report of 
fact finding committee are also to be struck down, being illegal, void 
and of no legal consequence, while contempt proceedings against 
those responsible for this highhandedness and ill egality  are to  be 
initiated and continued  separately, for which the office shall prepare 
a separate file and issue notice s to the concerned officials of EOBI 
and all others found involved in this scam.  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  41 
27.  As a sequel of above discussion, both these peti tions are 
allowed  and disposed of in the following terms: - 
(a) All the illegal appointments, deputations and 
absorptions made in the E OBI, as detailed in the 
report of fact finding committee on recruitment/  
appointment , are declared to be without lawful 
author ity and of no legal effect . Accordingly their 
services stand terminated forthwith ; 
(b) All the se vacancies and other available vacancies in 
EOBI shall be advertised and filled  afresh  strictly in 
accordance with applicable rules and regulations , 
subject to prescribed quota , requisite qualification s 
and merit criteria, for which the Chairman, EOBI 
shall be personally responsible to ensure 
transparency;  
(c) The matter regarding all the illegal appointments , 
including the appointment o f Raja Aze emul Haq 
Minhas in the World Bank , shall be investigated by 
the NAB authorities; the respondents No.3 to 7 and 
all other s directly or indirectly involved in the 
process of such illegal appointments on the basis of 
corruption, nepotism and political exigencies shall 
be proceeded against in accordance with law with 
intimation regarding compliance of these directions 
to this Court within t wo months.  Const. Petition No.6 of 2011 etc.  42 
(d) Office shall prepare  and maintain a separate file for 
initiatin g contempt proceedings , under Article 204 
of the Constitution and other  enabling provisions of 
contempt laws, against all those who are , prima -
facie, found guilty of violation of order dated 
21.1.2011 in H.R.C. No.48012 of 2010, particularly 
in the process of appointment of 238 employees/  
officials during the period September  2011 to May 
2012.  
In view of the above, other miscellaneous application s filed 
in the Constitutional Petition No.6 of 2011 and H.R.C. 
No.49012 -P of 2010 also stand disposed of.
