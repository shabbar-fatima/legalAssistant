JUDGMENT  
 
  FAISAL ARAB , J.- Being in the service of Pakistan 
Army, r espondent No. 2 was entitled to buy a residential and a 
commercial plot in Defence Housing Authority , Karachi  (DHA for 
short) . On the basis of such entitlement, s he applied to DHA for a 
2000 square yard residential and a  200 square yard commercial 
plot which were allotted to her in December, 1973. All dues and 
charges for such  allotments were cleared by 1983  and the plots 
were transferred in her name . In the same year she got the 2000 
square yards residential plot bifurca ted, which were  assigned plot 
Nos.57/1 and 57/2  having an area of 1000 square yards each . She 
retired from service  in the same year i.e.  in 1983.     
 
2.  In 1986 r espondent No.1, who is younger sister of 
respondent No.2 , filed a  suit against respondent No. 2 and sought CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  2
declaration that she is the real owner of the plots and respondent 
No.2 is only  an ostensible owner  i.e. a ‘ Benamidar’ . The basis to 
seek such a declaration  was that as respondent No.2 was neither 
interested nor had funds to pay for the plots so respondent No. 1 
offered that she would make all payments  for the plots to DHA  and 
became their owner to which  respondent No.2  agreed . Based on 
such understanding , the respondent No. 2 applied to DHA for the 
allotment of a residential and commercial plot s for which the entire 
price was paid by respondent No. 1 . It is also the case of the 
respondent No.1 that after respondent No.2 retired from service in 
1983 , she came to live with respondent No.1 at her Karachi 
residence and when asked  to transfer the plo ts in respondent 
No.1’s name she refused and thus the relations  between them 
became estranged  with the result that respondent No.2 left the 
house and went to reside with her old colleague. It was further 
stated in the plaint that in May, 1986 when responde nt No.1 came 
to know that respondent No.2 has entered into a sale transaction  
with someone  in relation to one of the residential plot s and the 
process of transfer was pending with DHA , she got alarmed that 
gave her the cause to file the suit for declaratio n and permanent 
injunction . The respondent No.1 obtained injunctive orders  from 
the Court  against the respondent No.2 and the DHA  in order to 
prevent  alienation of the plots until her claim was decided in the 
suit. 
 
3.  During the pendency of the suit, the  appellant , a 
stranger to the above mentioned controversy between the two 
sisters , interjected  in the suit by filing an application under Order CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  3
1 Rule 10 CPC  for his joinder as a defendant , on the strength of his 
claim that respondent No. 2 has entered int o sale transaction for 
the residential plots  with him. His application was allowed and the 
court joined him as a defendant . After recording of the evidence of 
the parties, the court held that respondent No.1 failed to establish  
that she is the real owner o f the plot and dismissed  the suit . 
Respondent No. 1 preferred first appeal which was also dismissed. 
She then filed second appeal in the High Court of Sindh, which 
was allowed vide impugned judgment . The High Court reversed the 
findings of the courts be low after holding that respondent No.  1 
has established in the evidence that there was an understanding 
between the two sisters  that the payments for the plots would be 
made by respondent No.1  and become the real owner which was 
accordingly paid by her to DHA  and respondent No.2 became just 
an ostensible owner.  
 
4.  The respondent No. 2  died during the pendency of the 
proceedings . Though her heirs were made party in the proceedings 
at the appellate stage , none of them came forward to challenge the 
decision of the High Court before this Court , hence i nsofar as 
respondent No. 1’s claim that her proprietary interest has been 
created in the suit property has attained finality , leaving the 
appellant  to file appeal in this Court on the strength of his plea  
that he wa s a bona fide  purchaser for valuable consideration .  
 
5.  Learned counsel for the appellant  submitted that the 
trial court and the first appellate court, after examining the 
evidence adduced by the parties , rightly came to the conclusion  CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  4
that respondent No . 2 was not a ‘Benamidar’  and fully competent 
to deal with the plots as a real owner , such finding ought not to 
have been reversed by the High Court in second appeal, scope of 
which is very limited.  As to the title document  of plots coming in 
the hands of respondent No.1, he submitted that the address of 
respondent No. 1 was given to DHA only for the purpose of 
communication  as she from time to time was posted in several 
parts of the country and on account of this fact the respondent 
No.1 came in possession  of title documents  of the plots  which she 
was holding in trust  for respondent No.2 . Learned counsel 
maintained that merely coming in possession of title documents  or 
demonstrating that payments have been made by her  to DHA , 
which is otherwise not factuall y correct, would not make 
respondent No.1 real owner of the suit properties . Learned counsel 
lastly contended that the High Court also erred in holding that the 
appellant failed to establish that he is a bona fide  purchaser for 
value  when it has come in th e evidence that he entered into sale 
transaction with respondent No.2 in whose name the open plots 
stood in her capacity as original allottee in the records of DHA  and 
no steps were taken by respondent No.1 to get the plots transferred 
in her name .  
  
6.  Learned counsel for the respondent No. 1  in rebuttal 
submitted that his client has sufficiently established  in evidence  
that based on the understanding between the two sisters she alone 
paid the entire amount for both the plots in the name of the 
responden t No.2  and was also given possession of the original title 
documents  thereby disentitling the respondent No. 2  from CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  5
subsequently claiming to be the real owner . He next contended 
that the burden to prove that the appellant was a bona fide  
purchaser was on t he appellant , which he failed to discharge  as in 
absence of examining the original title documents of the plots, 
which were with respondent No.1, he paid the entire sale 
consideration  to respondent No.2 .  
 
7.  After the High Court reversed the findings of the courts 
below and declared  respondent No.1 to be the real owner and 
respondent No.2 merely a ‘ Benamidar’  no appeal has been 
preferred by any of the heirs of respondent No.2  after her demise 
before this Court  though they were made party in the first 
Appe llate Court as well as in the High Court . Notwithstanding the 
finding  of the High Court , which creates proprietary interest of the 
respondent No. 1 in the suit plots, the fact remains that the plots 
were allotted  to respondent No.2  only for the reason that  she was 
in service of Pak Army. This entitlement  for allotment of plot s by 
itself has its own value , apart from the price that is paid  to DHA . 
Had the plot s in question been purchased by respondent No.1 from 
the open market, the price would have been much  higher than 
what was actually paid. Therefore, irrespective of the fact that it 
was held by the High Court that respondent No. 1 paid the entire 
amount to DHA for both the plots  from her own source , as held in 
second appeal , the fact remains that the plot s were allotted, not at 
their full market value but at concessionary price only for the 
reason that respondent No.2 was in the service of Pak Army. In 
this peculiar circumstance, the monetary contribution made by 
respondent No.1  cannot be regarded as the t rue reflect ion of the CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  6
entire value of the suit property and hence  cannot be regarded as 
sufficient to treat respondent No.1 full owner of the suit property  
though she paid the entire price . Therefore, in our assessment , 
respondent No. 1 ’s share in the plot s on account of her financial 
contribution cannot be considered more than half and the 
remaining half has to be attributed purely to respondent No. 2  on 
account of the privilege which she enjoyed in seeking allotment 
from DHA at much lower rate than the tr ue market value. Based 
on such distinction , respondent No.2  was entitled to sell one of the 
two residential plots. She in fact got the original residential plot 
bearing No. 57 bifurcated into two in 1983 i.e. plot No.57/1 and 
57/2  and entered into sale tra nsaction with regard to plot No.57/1  
in 1986 . The respondent No.2  in equity  was justified in entering into 
sale transaction with the appellant for the first plot i.e. plot No.57/1 .  
 
8.  As regards  the sale  transaction relating to plot No. 
57/2 , the appellant has claimed that he purchased plot No.57/2 
and sale consideration was shown to be Rs.250,000/ - paid 
through pay order No. AO/C192426 dated 05.05.1986. If the sale 
consideration of Rs.250,000/ - had already been settled for plot No. 
57/2 on or before 05. 05.1986 then it is surprising that the 
agreement which was executed for this plot on 06.05.1986 neither 
refers to any pay order nor the price that was settled was printed 
with the remaining text of the agreement as the consideration of 
Rs.250,000/ - for plo t No.57/2  is written in a handwriting after 
erasing the printed matter whereas in the same situation, the 
consideration of Rs.425,000/ - settled for plot No.57/1 in the first 
agreement executed on the same date i.e. 06.05.1986 was printed CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  7
along with the remaining text . Secondly, there is a marked 
difference in the sale consideration of both the plots as well i.e. 
Rs.425,000/ - for plot No.57/1 and Rs.250,000/ - for plot No.57/2 . 
This casts some doubt as to the genuineness of the agreement 
relating to plot No.5 7/2 and probably the deal for plot No.57/2 was 
belatedly came up to defeat the claim of respondent No.1  as the 
factum of two separate agreements is neither mentioned in the 
application filed by the appellant for joinder under  Order 1 Rule 10 
CPC applicatio n nor in his written statement  and in the first 
instance respondent No.2 in her counter affidavit to injunction 
application also denied sale transaction with regard to  plot 
No.57/ 2. Even otherwise,  ample discretion lies with the Court to 
deny the relief  to a purchaser of an immovable property keeping in 
view the circumstances of each as he cannot claim specific 
performance of a contract as a matter of right even where it is 
lawful to do so. In this regard, r eliance can be placed on the 
judgments of Ghulam Nabi Vs. Muhammad Yaqoob  (PLD 1983 SC 
344), Sirbaland Vs. Allah Loke  (1996 SCMR 575) Muhammad 
Sharif Vs. Nabi Bakhsh  (2012 SCMR 900), Farzand Ali Vs. Khuda 
Bakhsh  (PLD 2015 SC 187) , Adil Tiwana Vs. Shaukat Ullah Khan 
Bangash  (2015 SCMR 828)  and Muhammad Ab dur Rehman 
Qureshi  Vs. Sagheer Ahmad  (2017 SCMR 1696)  where this 
principle has been laid down  by this Court .   
 
9.  For what has been discussed above, the impugned 
judgment is modified to the extent that the appellant is entitled to 
plot No.57/1 whereas th e respondent No.1 has become entitled to 
plot No.57/2 and 50% share in the 200 yards commercial plot. The CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2084 OF 2016  8
remaining 50% in the commercial plot shall devolve upon the heirs 
of respondent No.2 in accordance with law of inheritance, which 
include respondent N o.1 being one of the heirs of respondent No.2.   
 
10.  This appeal was partly allowed  vide short order  dated 
28.06.2019  and the above are the  reasons for the same.
