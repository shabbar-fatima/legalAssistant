 
 
ORDER  
 
 
Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J .  For reasons to be recorded later, we 
dispose of  these appeals, petitions and miscellaneous applications  
through a short order as under:  
 
1. These matters  involve  a controversy regarding the allocation of 
seats reserved for women and non -Muslim s. The Sunni Itehad 
Council  (“SIC”) did not contest the General Elections of the year 
2024. SIC , which demands allocation of reserved seats on 
account of inclusion of independent parliamentarians in it, did 
not secure a single seat in t he National Assembly o r any of the 
Provincial Assemblies  nor submitted a list of its candidates for 
seats res erved for women and non -Muslims.  Thus , it is not 
entitled to any of the reserved seats in the National Assembly 
and in the Provincial Assemblies. The impugned judgment and 
the order dated 1 March 2024 of the Election Commission of 
Pakistan (“ECP”) to such extent is upheld.   
 
2. Under Article 51(3) of the Constitution  of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (“ Constitution ”), the total number of seats in 
the National Assembly shall be 326 , out of which 60 seats are 
reserved for women and 10 seats for non -Muslims. Such right 
of women and non -Muslims has been guaranteed by the 
Constitution. They shall be elected in accordance  with the law 
through proportional representation system of political parties’ 
list of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats 
secured by each political party from the Province concerned in 
the National Assembly and the Provincial Assemblies,  as 
provided by Article 51(6)  (d) and ( e) of the Constitution. 
Therefore , they cannot be deprived of this right of theirs by 
leaving these seats vacant , and all reserved seats must be filled 
in, as provided by Article 224(6) of the Constitution.   2 
 
3. The impugned judgment of the High Court and the said order of 
the ECP to the extent of the proportional representation 
distribution of seats amongst the political parties which won 
and secured seats is also maintained, however, since the ECP 
calculated and allocated the seats to the parties by the 
exclusion of the Pakistan Tehreek -e-Insaf  (“PTI”) candidates, 
therefore, to such extent, the impugned judgment of the Hi gh 
Court and the order of the ECP are set aside.  
 
4. During the hearing, it transpired that a number of candidates 
had submitted their nomination papers declaring on Oath that 
they belonged to PTI  supported by an affiliation certificate of the 
said party , though some did not submit affiliation certificates of 
PTI, however, since they stated on Oath that they belonged to 
PTI, and did not contradict themselves, they should be 
considered to be members of PTI in the National and the 
Provincial Assemblies . The ECP by misinterpreting the 
judgment of this Court dated 13 January 2024, which was 
regarding non -holding intra -party elections in PTI, wrongly 
mentioned the said candidates of the PTI as independent s in 
Form 33 of the Election Rules. The ECP had no au thority to 
declare validly nominated candidates of a political party to be 
independent candidates. Similarly, a candidate once declared 
himself/herself as a candidate of a political party, could not 
subsequently resile from his/her candidature of a particu lar 
party, after the last date of withdrawal of the nomination 
papers.   
 
 
5. It is important to mention here that neither the PTI nor any 
candidate affiliated with PTI approached either this Court before 
or during the hearing of these proceedings, or the High Court to 
challenge the decision of the ECP, declaring the m as 
independent s. However, in view of the fact that the appeal and 3 
 
the petition are a continuation of election proceedings before 
the ECP, we can look into the vires of the decision of t he ECP in 
the light of the provisions of Article 51(1)(d ) and (e) of the 
Constitution read with section s 66, 67 and 104 of the Elections 
Act, 2017  to safeguard the interest of  women and non -Muslims . 
As a consequence whereof, the candidates who had su bmitted 
their nomination papers declaring that they belonged to PTI and 
had not filed a document showing affiliation with another 
political party  before the last date of withdrawal of the 
nomination papers , should have been treated as the 
Parliamentary Par ty of PTI , but the needful was not done by the 
ECP. Consequently, the PTI as a Parliamentary Party is entitled 
to the reserved seats. The ECP should recalculate and reallocate 
the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including the 
PTI, as provided  by Article 51(6)(d) and (e) of the Constitution.  
 
 
6. The candidates who had submitted their nomination papers by 
24 December 2023, which was the last date of submission of 
nomination papers, and had declared themselves either as 
independent candidates or had left blank the relevant column 
in the nomination papers /declaration  and were elected shall be 
considered to be independents. SIC is a registered political 
party and every independent member of the National Assembly 
and of the Provincial Assemblies has a right to join it. All those 
who joined the SIC are presumed to have don e so out of their 
own free will. None of them claimed to have joined SIC because 
of any misunderstanding of any judgment, the law, compulsion, 
coercion or un due influence  and it is not for this Court to 
presume otherwise.  
 
7. We must ensure that words are not read into the Constitution 
nor to ascribe artificial meaning to commonly understood 
words. We must also abide by validly enacted laws and must 4 
 
not do anythi ng either to hinder or facilitate a political party by 
ignoring the laws mandate.

ORDER  
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha 
A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi , Shahid Waheed and 
Irfan Saadat Khan,  JJ.: For detailed reasons to be recorded later and 
subject to what is set out therein by way of amplification and/or 
explanation or otherwise, these appeals are decided in the follo wing terms:  
1. The impugned judgment dated 25.03.2024 of the learned Full Bench 
of the High Court is set aside to the extent it is or may be inconsistent with 
this Order or the detailed reasons.  
2. The order of the Election Commission of Pakistan (“Commission”) 
dated 01.03.2024 (“Impugned Order”) is declared to be ultra vires the 
Constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  
3. The notifications (of various dates) whereby the persons respectively 
mentioned therein (being the persons identified in th e Commission’s 
notification No.F.5(1)/2024 -Cord. dated 13.05.2024) have been declared to 
be returned candidates for reserved seats for women and minorities in the 
National and Provincial Assemblies are declared to be ultra vires the 
Constitution, without l awful authority and of no legal effect, and are 
quashed from 06.05.2024 onwards, being the date an interim order was 
made by the Court in CPLA Nos. 1328 -9 of 2024, the leave petitions out of 
which the instant appeals arise.  
4. It is declared that the lack or denial of an election symbol does not in 
any manner affect the constitutional and legal rights of a political party to 
participate in an election (whether general or bye) and to field candidates 
and the Commission is under a constitutional duty to act, and  construe 
and apply all statutory provisions, accordingly.    Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.  
 
 5
5. It is declared that for the purposes, and within the meaning, of 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of clause (6) of Article 51 (“Article 51 Provisions”) and 
paragraph (c) of clause (3) of Article 106 (“Art icle 106 Provisions”) of the 
Constitution, the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (“PTI”) was and is a political 
party, which secured or won (the two terms being interchangeable) general 
seats in the National and Provincial Assemblies in the General Elections of 
2024 as herein after provided.  
6. During the course of the hearing of the instant appeals, on 
27.06.2024, learned counsel for the Commission placed before the Court a 
list (“the List”) of 80 returned candidates for the National Assembly (now 
MNAs), setting out i n tabular form particulars relating to their election. 
Learned counsel made a categorical statement that the Commission stood 
by the data so provided to the Court. In particular, the List contained three 
columns marked as follows: (i) “Statement (on nomina tion form) given in 
declaration and oath by the person nominated (i.e.,  ‘I belong to’)”; (ii) 
“Certificate of party affiliation under Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017”; 
and (iii) “Statutory Declaration/affidavit accompanying section 66 
certificate”.  
7. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the General Election of 
2024, it is declared that out of the aforesaid 80 returned candidates (now 
MNAs) those (being 39 in all and whose particulars are set out in Annex A 
to this Order) in respect of whom the C ommission has shown “PTI” in any 
one of the aforesaid columns in the List, were and are the returned 
candidates whose seats were and have been secured by the PTI within the 
meaning, and for purposes of, para 5 above in relation to the Article 51 
Provisions . 
8. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the General Election of 
2024, it is further ordered that any of the remaining 41 returned 
candidates out of the aforesaid 80 (whose particulars are set out in Annex 
B to this Order) may, within 15 working days o f this Order file a statement 
duly signed and notarized stating that he or she contested the General 
Election as a candidate of the political party specified therein. If any such 
statement(s) is/are filed, the Commission shall forthwith but in any case 
within 7 days thereafter give notice to the political party concerned to file, Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.  
 
 6
within 15 working days, a confirmation that the candidate contested the 
General Election as its candidate. A political party may in any case, at any 
time after the filing of a stat ement as aforesaid, of its own motion file its 
confirmation. If such a statement is filed, and is confirmed by the political 
party concerned, then the seat secured by such candidate shall be 
forthwith deemed to be a seat secured by that political party for  the 
purposes of para 5 above in relation to the Article 51 Provisions. The 
Commission shall also forthwith issue, and post on its website, a list of the 
retuned candidates (now MNAs) and seats to which this para applies within 
7 days after the last date o n which a political party may file its confirmation 
and shall simultaneously file a compliance report in the Court.  
9. For the purposes of para 5 of this Order in relation to the Article 51 
Provisions, the number of general seats secured by PTI shall be the t otal of 
the seats declared in terms of para 7 and those, if any, to which para 8 
applies. The PTI shall be entitled to reserved seats for women and 
minorities in the National Assembly accordingly. PTI shall, within 15 
working days of this Order file its li sts of candidates for the said reserved 
seats and the provisions of the Elections Act, 2017 (“Act”) (including in 
particular s. 104) and the Elections Rules, 2017 (“Rules”) shall be applied 
to such lists in such manner as gives effect to this Order in full  measure. 
The Commission shall, out of the reserved seats for women and minorities 
in the National Assembly to which para 3 of this Order applies, notify as 
elected in terms of the Article 51 Provisions, that number of candidates 
from the lists filed (or, as the case may be, to be filed) by the PTI as is 
proportionate to the general seats secured by it in terms of paras 7 and 8 of 
this Order.  
10. The foregoing paras shall apply mutatis mutandis for purposes of the 
Article 106 Provisions in relation to PTI (as s et out in para 5 herein above) 
for the reserved seats for women and minorities in the Khyber Pakhtunkwa, 
Punjab and Sindh Provincial Assemblies to which para 3 of this Order 
applies. In case the Commission or PTI need any clarification or order so as 
to give effect to this para in full measure, it shall forthwith apply to the 
Court by making an appropriate application, which shall be put up before Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.

challenged in the present appeals and petitions ; and  the 
persons  who would be affected or aggrieved are not parties

to a political party in the National Assembly and the Provincial 
Assemblies would  not be legally appropriate .  
3. Accordingly, the Election Commission of Pakistan  is directed to 
decide the allocation  of reserved seats for women and non -Muslims 
to political parties in the National Assembly  and the Provincial 
Assemblies  in the light of the d eterminations made hereinabove  
after providing an opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned , 
and if required revisit its earlier decision s on the matter. The 
needful be done within seven days of the receipt of this order.
