JUDGMENT  
 
 
MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR, J . This Civil Petition for leave to appeal is 
directed against the judgment dated 28.01.2022 passed by the Federal 
Service Tribunal, Islamabad  (“Tribunal”),  in Appeal No. 848 (P) 
CS/2019 , whereby the appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed.  
 
 
2. According to  the short -lived facts, the petitioner was appointed as a 
postman (BPS-5) but was subsequently promoted as a Clerk  (BPS-7). 
During the employment, his post was upgraded from BPS -7 to BPS -9. 
On attaining the age of superannuation , the petitioner was retired 
from service  on 18.05.2015.  Two different  orders of the Tribunal  dated 
25.05.2016 and 26. 05.2016 are available in the paper -book, passed by 
the same Tribunal in two appeals of the very same petitioner. The 
chronological events dem onstrate that in Appeal No.  791 (P) CS/2013, 
the Tribunal modified the order of removal of service of the petitioner 
to stoppage of two increments for a period of two years  without 
cumulative effect. A s a consequence thereof, the impugned orders were 
set a side and the petitioner was reinstated into service with 
consequential back benefits. While the same Tribunal, on the  very next C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -2- 
 
day, vide its order dated 26. 05.2016, in Appeal No.  789 (P) CS/2013, 
allowed  this appeal  and also modified the penalty  of withho lding  two 
steps increment for two years into one increment for  one year  only. 
The present grievance  of the petitioner  is that after four years of 
retirement , the respondent department issued the impugned order 
dated 14.02.2019 , whereby the intervening period with effect from 
01.09.2013 to 17.05.2015  was treated without leave , which was not 
adverted to by the Tribunal and his appeal was dismissed vide the 
impugned  judgment.   
 
 
 
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued th at the petitioner had 
filed Miscellaneous Petition No.1122/2019 in Appeal No. 789 (P) 
CS/2013 before  the Federal Service Tribunal for the implementation of 
the judgment  dated 26.05.2016 , but the Tribunal , vide its order dated 
05.11.2019 , disposed of the application , stating  that the petitioner 
may challenge the said  order before the competent legal forum.  It was 
further contended that in the initial judgment, the Tribunal reinstated 
the petitioner into service with consequential back benefits , but the 
respondent department , even then , treated the above -stated 
intervening period as without leave , which is illegal . It was further 
averred that the Tribunal , while passing the impugned  order , failed to 
consider that the department was legally bound to implement  the 
judgment of the learned Tribunal dated 25.05.2016 in its true spirit  
and was liable to pay the pensionary  benefits of  the intervening period 
w.e.f. 01.09.2013 to 17.05 .2015  to the petitioner . He further argued 
that the petitioner served the department during this intervening 
period for three years and was reinstated in to service with all back 
benefits ; hence , the department cannot penalize him after retirement . 
He further argued that the discretion exercised by the a uthority vide 
order dated 14.02.2019 was illegal.  
 
 
4. The learned Additional A ttorney General of Pakistan  argued that the 
Tribunal had modified the major penalty of removal from service into a 
minor penalty of stoppage of two increments without cumulative effect. 
He further argued that though the petitioner was reinstated into 
service with all the consequential back benefits , no order was passed 
with regard  to the intervening period ; therefore, the department 
decided the question of the intervening period as per relevant rules 
and rightly withheld the benefits of  the intervening period.  C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -3- 
 
 
5. Heard the arguments. The nucleus of the impugned judgment 
passed by the Federal Service Tribunal depicts t hat the appeal of the 
petitioner was found to be hit by the doctrine of Res Judicata , with the 
rider that the issue of the intervening period was considered in the 
Tribunal ’s order  dated 25. 05.2016 , which was not challenged by the 
petitioner in this Court . It was further observed by the Tribunal that in 
a fresh appeal, it cannot enlarge the scope or reinterpret a matter 
already decided , and since the petitioner was not acquitted honorably  
but the major penalty was modified to a minor  penalty , hence a s per 
F.R. 54 (b)  of the Fundamental Rules,  it was the jurisdiction of the 
authority to decide upon  such portion of pay and allowances . It was 
further observed by the Tribunal that there is no provision of second 
departmental appeal in the law . 
 
 
6. It is an admi tted position that the petitioner reached the 
superannuation  age and was retired from service with effect from 
18.05.2015. The bone of contention is the letter dated 14. 02.2019 
issued by the Office of Divisional  Superintendent  Postal Service Kohat , 
which i s reproduced as under: - 
  
 
“OFFICE OF THE DIVISIONAL SUPERINTENDENT POSTAL

 C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -4- 
 
7. The main reliance was made by the department  on the niceties of 
F.R. 54 (a) with the justification that the petitioner was not  
honourably acquitted by the Tribunal vide order dated  25-05-2016 
passed in A ppeal No. 791 (P) CS/2013 , therefore the  period of service 
from 01 .09.2013 to 17 .05.2015 should be considered without pay.  
 
8. The Fundamental  Rules came into effect from 1st January , 1922 , 
and the said Rules are applicable , subject to the provisions contained 
in its Rule 3 , to all government serva nts who are subject to the rule -
making powers of the president and whose pay is debitable to the civil 
estimates , and to any other class of  government servants to which the 
presiden t may , by general or special order , declare to be applicable. 
For ease of convenience , F.R. 54, substituted by S.R.O 718 (I)/1993 , 
dated 02.08.1993 , made effective from 30. 06.1993 , is replicated as 
under: - 
 
“F.R. 54 - Where a Government Servant has been dis missed or 
removed is reinstated, the revising or appellate authority may grant to 
him for the period of his absence from duty - 
 
(a)  if he is honourably acquitted, the full pay to which he would have 
been entitled if he had not been dismissed or removed an d, by an 
order to be separately recorded, any allowance of which he was in 
receipt prior to his dismissal removal; or  
 
(b)  if otherwise, such portion of such pay and allowances as the 
revising or appellate authority may prescribe.  
 
In a case falling under  clause (a), the period of absence from duty will 
be treated as a period spent on duty.  
 
In a case falling under clause (b), it will not be treated as a period 
spent on duty unless the revising appellate authority so directs.  
 
Explanation. - In this rule, "revising authority" me ans the "authority" 
or "authoris ed Officer" as defined in the Government Servants 
(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973, who passes the final order on 
the case and not the authority who passes an order on appeal ”. 
 
 
 
9. The minutia e of F.R. 54 explicates that in the situation  where a 
dismissed government servant is reinstated, the revising or appellate 
authority may grant  his pay  to him for the period of his absence from 
duty. Seemingly, the letter in question refers to F.R. 54 (a), which 
emphasizes  that if such a government servant is honourably acquitted, 
he shall be granted the full pay to which he would have been entitled if 
he had not been dismissed or removed , and, by an order to be 
separately recorded, any allowance of which he was in receipt prior to 
his dismissal or removal . In a case falling under clause (a), the period 
of absence from duty will be treated as a period spent on duty.  
According to the explanation attached  to this Rule, the "revising C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -5- 
 
authority" me ans the  "authority" or "authoris ed Officer" as defined in 
the Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973, who 
passes the final order on the case and not the authority who passes an 
order on appeal.   
 
 
10. At this junct ure, it is quite pertinent t o have a look at the 
definition of “Authority” and “A uthorised Officer" . According to the  
definitions provided under Rule 2 of the Government Servants 
(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973 , the "authority" means the 
appointing authority prescribed in Rule 6 of the Civil Servants 
(Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973 , provided that in 
the case of disciplinary proceedin gs already initiated against a 
government servan t before 14th June , 2000, the  powers of the 
"authority" shall be exercised by the officer designate d as such before 
the aforesaid date . Whereas "authorised officer" means an officer 
authorised by the authority to perform the functions of an authorised 
officer under these rules or, if no officer is so authorised, the authority . 
Even otherwise, the niceties of F .R. 54 enlighten s that in the case of 
reinstatement of dismissed or removed employee, only the revising or 
appellate authority may grant  him his pay  for the period of his absence 
from duty , and if he is honourably acquitted  then, the full pay to 
which he would have been entitled to, and his period of absence from 
duty will be treated as a period spent on duty.  Though this Rule is not 
germane to the present controversy , but at the same time, it is a 
ground reality that n either  the respondents place d anything on the 
record to show that  the Divisional Superintendent, Postal Service 
Kohat , was actually the revising or appellate authority , nor any 
document was submitted to show  that he was authorised to issue  any 
such letter or take  any such decision in the capacity of  a revising or 
appellate authority  under the exactitudes of F.R. 54. 
 
 
 
 
11. The petitioner was deprived of his pay for the intervening period , 
from 01 .09.2013 to 17 .05.2015 , in view of F.R. 54 (a) merely on the 
ground that he was not honourably acquitted by the Tribunal,  and the 
major penalty was modified in  view of the judgment passed on 
25.05.2016 in Appeal No. 791 (P) CS/2013 . Still,  in tandem, the 
department is ignoring that the same Tribunal in  the same judgment 
also set aside the impugned orders , and the petition er was reinstated 
into service w ith consequential back benefits.  In another judgment in C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -6- 
 
the case of the same petitioner by the same Tribunal on the very next 
date, i.e., 26.05.2016, in Appeal No.  789 (P) CS/2013, the major 
penalty of withholding of two steps  increment for two years without 
future effect was modified into withholding  one increment for one year 
only. However, in the judgment dated 25. 05.2016, the reinstatement 
order was pa ssed with consequential back benefits , which order is in 
the field. There is a marked distinction between  criminal cases and 
service matter s. The petitioner was not indicted by the Tribunal in any 
criminal case or offence;  rather , the decision was rendered on the 
appeals of the petitioner , whereby he challenged  the order of the 
departmental authority and not the order or judgment of any court of 
law trying the offence  under criminal or penal laws. T herefore, in the 
present set of circumstances , the question of honourable acquittal or 
conviction does not arise. Furthermore, when the Tribunal has passed 
the reinstatement order with consequential back benefits , then, in this 
particular situation , the revising or appellate authority cannot undo or 
make ineffective the order or judgment passed by the Tribunal for the 
payment of consequential back benefits. The penalty  imposed  on the 
petitioner  was only confined to withholding of an increment for  a 
certain period , which does not otherwise  mean to withhold  his pay for 
the period he actually  rendered his services to the department , and the 
principle of “no work , no p ay” is not applicable when consequential 
back benefits have been accorded  by the Tribunal.   
 
 
12. The Civil Service Regulations are premeditated to define the 
conditions under which salaries, leave s, pension , and other allowances  
are e arned by the employees in  the service of the Civil Departments 
and the manner  in which  the perks are calculated. B ut at the same  
time, these regulations do not deal otherwise than indirectly and 
incidental ly with matters relating to recruitment, promotion, official 
duties , and discipline. Since the intricacie s of Article 417-A of the Civil 
Service Regulations ( “C.S.R. ”) bear significance in addressing  the 
controversy , therefore, it is reproduced  as under: - 
 
 
“417-A. If an officer, who has been suspended pending inquiry into 
his conduct attains the age of superannuation before the completion 
of the inquiry, the disciplinary proceedings against him shall abate 
and such officer shall retire with full pensionary  benefits and the 
period of suspension shall be treated as period spent on duty ”. 
 
      
 C.P.No. 1066 /2022  -7- 
 
13.  The petitioner retired on 18.05.2015 and the letter for withholding 
his emoluments from 01.09. 2013 to 17.05.2015  was issued to him on 
14.02. 2019 , whereas , under Art icle 417-A of the C.S.R., the pending 
disciplinary proceedings could not continue if the officer attains the 
age of superannuation before  the completion of the inquiry. T herefore, 
in that context too, the pending proceedings  if any were abate d and 
there was no justification to issue the letter after considerable period 
of retirement for withholding the salary with retrospective effect which 
was totally unjustified and unwarranted . The two judgments of the 
Tribunal passed in two different appeal s of the same petitioner on 
25.05.2016 and 26. 05.2016 are also mutually destructive and raised 
much confusion regarding the  right decision of the department and 
even in the last judgment dated 28. 01.2022 , which is impugned  before 
us in the present petition , the Tribunal failed to correctly touch on, 
reconcile , and distinguish its earlier two judgment s in the case of the 
petitioner (Appeal No.  791 (P) CS/2013, decided on 25. 05.2016 and 
Appeal No.  789 (P) CS/2023, decided on 26. 05.2016) ,  which in reality 
created much perplexity and  misconception and also became a cause 
of concern due to its non -implementation in the right and appropriate 
manner.   
 
 
14. As a result of the above discussion, this Civil Petition is converted 
into an appeal and allowed. The impugned judgment of the learned 
Federal Service Tribunal dated 28.01.2022 and the directions issued 
by the Divisional Superintendent, Postal Service Kohat , vide letter 
dated 14. 02.2019 for w ithholding the pay of the petitioner are set 
aside , and he is entitled to be paid  for the period mentioned in the 
letter dated 14. 02.2019 accordingly.
