ORDE R 
 
  We have called learned Attorney General for Pakistan 
to be of assistance. The Local Government Elections in the 
Cantonment Areas have not been held since 1998 and now the 
reason being given by the Federal Government for delay is that the 
Government is  contemplating to amend the Cantonment Act, 1924 
and the Cantonment Local Government Election Ordinance, 2002.  
2.  Holding of Local Government Elections is mandated by 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan in terms of Article 
140A and as requir ed by the Principles of Policy enshrined in the C.M.A. NO. 7546/20 13 IN CONSTITUTION PETITION NO. 65/2009  etc 2
Constitution (Article 32). In the afore -referred circumstances, we 
would like learned Attorney General for Pakistan to be of 
assistance particularly on the following points: - 
i) what is the consequence of any  further delay in 
holding of Local Government Elections in the 
Cantonment Areas in terms of the afore -referred 
provision? and  
ii) whether the Local Government Elections in 
Cantonment Areas can be held under the existing law?  
 
3.  The question of contempt a gainst Mr. Asif Yaseen 
Malik shall also be taken up on the next date. Adjourned to 
20.2.2014 as requested.
