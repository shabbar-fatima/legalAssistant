ORDER  
  MIAN SAQIB NISAR, CJ. -  
10:30 a.m.:  
  Our judgment dated 13.2.2018 has not been complied with 
till date. The review petitions though have been filed against the said 
judgment but no interim relief has been granted therein to suspen d the 
judgment  under review . Let the Chief Executive Officers of HBL, ABL, 
UBL and MCB be present in the Court at 6:30 p.m. today , or in lieu 
thereof, an undertaking be made by the said Banks to the effect that the 
judgment dated 13.2.2018 shall be complie d with in letter and spirit . 
6:30 p.m.:  
2.  Pursuant to our above order in the morning, Mr. Salman 
Aslam Butt, learned Sr. ASC present  in Court has placed on the record 
the written undertaking s on behalf of UBL and MCB , which are scanned 
as under:  
  -: 3 :- 
 
3.  On account of the above, we hold that the judgment un der 
review shall be implemented in letter and spirit. However, after hearing 
the learned counsel representing the Banks and going through the 
contents of the review petitions, we do not find any merit in  these review 
petitions, which are accordingly dismissed but with one clarification , on 
the request of the learned counsel , that the implementation shall  be 
made with regard to the persons who have been retired/ retrenched by 
the respective Banks but the sa me shall not be done  regarding the 
persons who left the Banks on the basis of the Golden Handshake 
Scheme (GHSS ) because t hose who have received the benefits of the GHSS 
do not fall within the said category, and thus are not entitled to the said 
benefit of  increase in pension . It is further clarified that pensionary 
benefits under our judgment dated 13.2.2018 will be paid to the 5416 
retrenched employees of UBL whose services were terminated under the 
retrenchment scheme dated 10.10.1997, if they qualified on the said date 
in terms of having served the bank for ten years.  
  -: 4 :- 
4.  Syed Ali Zafar, learned ASC representing HBL has placed on 
the record the following undertaking:  
 
He s tates that  during the course of hearing of the matter as per 
paragraph 2(v)(c) of  the proposal submitted by him, some clarification of 
the judgment under review is required, suffice it to say that this by itself 
is no ground for review. No case for review has been made out. The 
review petitio n is accordingly dismissed. However, if any person , who is 
entitled to the pension in terms of the said judgment,  if not paid , may  -: 5 :- 
approach th is Court for enforcement of his right  and that matter shall be 
decided independently .  
 
5.  Mr. Shahid Anwar Bajwa, learned ASC representing Allied 
Bank Limit ed, has also placed on the record the following undertaking:  
 
 
He states that a clarification is required regarding those employees who 
have received 50% commutation of the ir pension;  suffice it to say that 
this by itself is no ground for review. No case for review has been made 
out. The review petition is accordingly dismissed. However, if any person 
who is not paid pension which he feels entitled under the judgment may  -: 6 :- 
approach this Court for the enforcement of his right on that basis, this 
aspect of the  matter shall be considered  independently .  
 
6.  No case for review has been made out  in all other review 
petitions . The review petitions and miscellaneous applications /appeals
