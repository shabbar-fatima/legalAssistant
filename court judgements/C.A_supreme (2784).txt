ORDER  
 
C.R.P. NO. 2 -K/2014 IN CMA NO. 589 -K/2013 IN S.M .C. NO. 
16/2011  
 
  Through this petition, petitioner has sought 
clarification of the order dated 28.11.2013 passed in CMA No. 589 -
K/2013 in SMC No. 16/2011 vide which this Court relaying on an 
earlier order in the afore -mentioned suo moto case dated 
28.11. 2011 directed as follows: - 
“For convenience, the relevant paragraph of the above said 
order is reproduced hereunder: - 
 
“……………….. we hereby until further orders restrain the 
Government/Revenue Department from mutation, allotment, 
transfer and or conversion of any state land and or keeping any 
transaction or entry in the record of rights in this regard in revenue 
record of Sindh or till the entire revenue record in Sindh is 
reconstructed. The conversion of lease for 30 years or of any term 
upto 99 years shall  also be stopped immediately as by this mode 
the state land isbeing sold out at the throwaway price without 
participation of public at large, which the law does not permit. Any 
further conversion or mutation of state land in the record of rights 
from today  onwards would be deemed nullity and would expose 
the Deputy Commissioner/DCO of the relevant districts/dehs 
besides others to contempt proceedings.”  
 
 However, it is expedient to clarify that as far as the above 
restraint order is concerned, it shall be a pplicable only to the extent 
of the State land only. As far as the private property which is 
required for the purposes of utilization by the State itself etc is 
concerned the revenue authorities shall be free to enter the 
transaction/mutation etc in the re cord of rights as usual. However, 
for further clarification he would approach the department for 
passing the appropriate orders. CMA stands disposed of.”  S.M.C. NO. 16 OF 2011 ETCETERA  3

acres of land from NC No. 34 Deh Mandro, Karac hi was given on 
99 years lease to Inter Services Intelligence for residential purposes

stay order granted by this Court.

REGARDING APPOINTMENT OF CO MMISSION FOR ENSURING 
RECOVERY OF THE CUSTOM DUTIES/TAXES  
 
8.  Learned Deputy Attorney General submits that in 
terms of this Court’s order dated 29.11.2013 the Federal 
Government has done the needful and the Chairman Federal S.M.C. NO. 16 OF 2011 ETCETERA  5
Board of Revenue has provided a  list of six officers out of which 
this Court may appoint a Commission.  
9.  We appreciate the interest taken by the Chairman, 
Federal Board of Revenue in providing names. However, we in the 
first instance would like to trust the Board of Revenue to carry out 
its functions more vigilantly and effectively so that no one is 
allowed to evade customs duties and taxes. We for the present 
keep the issue of appointing a Commission pending and if need be 
an order would be passed but that would be only if we find an y 
laxity on the part of the Board of Revenue.
