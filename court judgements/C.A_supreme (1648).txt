Advocate, in person, but today nobody has turned up to pursue this 
matter . It is pointed out by learned counsel for the petitioner in Const. 
Petition No.28/ 2016  that petitioner Tariq Asad has passed away . In that

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. Though , the question 
of maintainability under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan , 1973,  would have been relevant but we note that 
vide order dated 03.11.2016 , this issue ha d been decided and it was 
found that all the petitions  (fixed on that da te including this petition)  
were maintainable . All the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Const.P.26&28/16  2
petitioner s as well as the respondents  also agree that this no longer is an 
issue requiring determination.  
3. Certain queries are put  to the learned counsel f or the petitioner as 
under:  
1) How and under what circumstances this petition was 
de-linked from the other petition s at the request of 
learned counsel for the petitioner  and what was the 
purpose for requesting to detach these petitions from 
others? We note th at this petition was filed much 
earlier than those petitions which were  later decided 
by a 5-Member Bench of this Court ; 
2) Whether  the matter in hand is not covered by the 
Income Tax Ordinance 2001 ( Ordinance 2001 ) with 
regard to the tax liability  of the con cerned persons?   
3) Whether  the liability of tax is not within the purview of 
the officers of Federal Board of Revenue ( FBR) under 
the Ordinance 2001 ? 
4) Whether  the State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP), directions 
of SBP  and the Foreign Exchange Manual are not 
relevant  with regard to money sent abroad for 
purchase of said properties?  
5) Whether  FBR, SBP and other relevant departments  do 
not have their own hierarchy  for deciding matters and 
their final orders may ultimately be challenged befor e 
the High Court and this Court ? 
6) Whether the  petitioner approach ed the SBP, FBR, FIA, 
Anti-Corruption Department, etc. against the persons  
named in Panama Leaks?  
7) Whether  in the presence of existing statutory bodies  
and institutions , a commission  as sought should be 
constituted  for inqui ring into the matter in hand ?  
8) Will the working of the said statutory bod ies not be 
affected if the proposed c ommission opines otherwise ? 
9) Whether an order for the constitution of a c ommission 
can be passed without issuing notice to or hearing
