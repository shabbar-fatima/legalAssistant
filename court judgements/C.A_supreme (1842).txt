Judgment  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J.- With a common 
thread, the captioned appeals,  though  arisen out of different cases,  
nonetheless , inhere identical question of law and thus are being 
decided through this single judgment. Respondents were indicted 
for possession of narcotic contraband, in excess of 10 kilograms in 
each case; convicted under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotics 
Substance s Act, 1997 , they were  sentenced to imprisonment for 
life along with fine. In appeals, their convictions were maintained , 
however , sentences awarded to them by  the learned trial Court s 
were reduced to ten years R.I. The State did not countenance with 
the error and sought  rectification thereof. In each case the leave 
has been granted to examine the vires of reduction of sentence. 
Respondents, released in consequence of the impugned judgments, 
despite repeated attempts, nonetheless, found it convenient to stay 
away from the Court by avoiding the process; they cannot be 
allowed to hold the process of law in abeyance by their default, Crl.As No.13 -P/09, 37 -P & 38 -P/11 & 16 -P/12

seemingly deliberate in circumstances. An appellant or a 
respondent has to be afforded a reasonable opportunity of hearing 
so as to vindicate his position more so in situations involving 
corporal consequences, however a party cannot avail this 
opportunity to  a point of time of its own choice and therefore once 
the absence is found calculated to obstruct the judicial process, a 
case can be decided on its own merits. This practice is being 
consiste ntly followed since the advent  of case reported as  Chan 
Shah ver sus The Crown  (PLD 1956 FC 43 ) subsequently reaffirmed 
in the cases reported as Gul Hassan and another  versus The State  
(PLD 1969 S C 89) as well as  Ikramullah and others versus The 
State  (2015 SCMR 1002 ). In this backdrop, we have examined the 
propriety of  reduction of sentences with the assistance of learned 
counsel for the appellant . He has invited our attention to  the 
proviso to Section 9 of the Act ibid, mandatorily providing 
punishment being not less than imprisonment for life in case the 
quantity of c ontraband exceeds ten kilograms, a common feature 
in each case.  
2.  Command of law escaped notice of the learned Judges 
of the Peshawar High Court and thus there being no occasion  for 
the reduction of sentences,  the captioned appeals are allowed, 
impugned  judgments are set aside. Sentences awarded to the 
respondents by the learned trial Court s are restored. Perpetual 
warrants of arrest shall  issue to bring the respondents to law so as 
to serve out sentences consequent upon convictions , never 
challenged by them before this Court.
