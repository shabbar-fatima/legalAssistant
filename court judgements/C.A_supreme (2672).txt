ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ . – In pursuance 
of order dated 14.04.2011, Raja Abdul Ghafoor, learned AOR 
filed a copy of the letter dated 14.04.2011 written by Syed Nasir 
Ali Shah, Solicitor General, Ministry of Law to hi m, which reads 
as under : -  CRP 129 -2010 DT 18.04.2011  3 
“Subject:  REVIEW PETITION NO. 129/2010 TITLED 
“FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN PETITIONER VS. 
DR. MUBASHIR HASAN – RESPONDENT ETC.” 
PENDING IN THE SUPREME COURT OF 
PAKISTAN   
 
  In the subject case you were nominated as 
AOR to represent the Federation of Pakistan. Subsequently 
you addressed a letter to this Division in which you 
expressed your inability to continue as Advocate on Record 
in the subject case owing to your indisposition.  
  As such your nomination as Advocate on 
Record, as p er your request is withdrawn. You are 
requested to give letter of authority to Syed Zafar Abbas 
Naqvi, Advocate on Record as per Supreme Court of 
Pakistan Rules, 1980.  
        Sd/ -  
(Syed Nasir Ali Shah)  
   Solicitor General

In continuation of above , he stated that he had submitted 
application dated 14.0 4.2011 requesting the concerned quarters 
that he may be disassociated from this case on account of 
indisposition. It is to be noted that he had been regularly 
appearing not on ly in this case, but also in many other cases, 
wherein he had filed his power  of attorney  on behalf of litigants 
as AOR and prior to this he had never pointed out about his 
disassociation/withdrawal on account of health reasons. It 
perhaps ha s happened in the background of the orders passed by 
this Court continuously , from 11.04.2011, 12.04.2011 and 
14.04.2011 when the case was adjourned for one or the other 
reason on account of lack of interest by the Federation of 
Pakistan  to pursue the case . The orders a re self -explanatory. 
However, for the time being , they are not reproduced herein 
except that on 14.04.2011 while postponing the matter for CRP 129 -2010 DT 18.04.2011  4 
today’s hearing when Mr. K.K. Agha, learned Additional Attorney 
General for Pakistan , despite showing indulgence that  he may 
have assistance of any other counsel while arguing the case, 
prayed for adjournment to seek fresh instruction s as it was not 
possible for him to make statement at that time, therefore, while 
loudly observing that the courts are always interested to  decide 
cases on merits instead of withholding the relief on any 
technicality, but always subject to the Constitution and the law, 
therefore, while discussing the scheme of the Supreme Court 
Rules, 1980, it was observed that in fact it is the AOR who ha s 
principal duty to argue the case in absence of the ASC. Two 
judgments in this behalf were also cited. It seems that on having 
notice , the learned AOR , instead of obeying the command of the 
Rules, under which in absence of ASC he is responsible to argue 
the case, got issued above letter. When we use these words, we 
are supported by the record, which has been produced as per our 
direction by Mr. Nasir Ali Shah, Solicitor General, Government of 
Pakistan to see whether the letter so written by the AOR is 
availab le. On consulting the relevant file, which has also been 
placed for our perusal in chambers, no such letter was available. 
It may not be out of context to mention that when inquired from 
AOR before consulting the record , he stated that he had not  
retained copy of the letter sent by him. Interestingly, there is no 
note sheet in the relevant file placed for our perusal by the 
Solicitor as according to him letter along with the said file is 
missing. In view of the importance of the issue, prima  facie, CRP 129 -2010 DT 18.04.2011  5 
statemen t so made by the Solicitor is not acceptable , inasmuch 
as he failed to produce extract from the office diary maintained 
to receive mail coming from outside the office, therefore, Raja 
Abdul Ghafoor, AOR in this manner, however, managed not to 
argue the cas e. Under these circumstances, Mr. K.K. Agha, 
Additional Attorney General for Pakistan stated that he had also 
no fresh instruction except that the Government be allowed to 
arrange another counsel. His request in this behalf has already 
been turned down. On  this, we asked the learned Attorney 
General for Pakistan, the chief law officer of the country , whose 
appointment takes place under Article 100 of the Constitution 
and who also enjoys certain powers envisaged under Article 57 of 
the Constitution , to argue  the case  because he had remained 
associated with it, his response was that at that time he was not 
the Attorney General for Pakistan. We pointed out to him that the 
Attorney General for Pakistan who appeared at that time was 
invited to assist the Court in  terms of Order XXVII CPC, but as in 
the interest of justice the Court is trying its best to proceed with 
the matter, he was one of the advocates in whom the 
Government/Federation had trust  and  who  can address the 
Court. He sought time for instruction s. Accordingly, on the re -
assembling of the Court , we pointed out to him that who else 
could be the best lawyer comparing to him, he stated that some 
time be given to him as he has suggested a via media to the 
Government, which he did not want to disclose before us. 
Therefore, at his request, case is adjourned to 19.04.2011.  CRP 129 -2010 DT 18.04.2011  6 
  As Raja Abdul Ghafoor, AOR has shown his inability  to 
continue as AOR on account of indisposition as is evident from 
the above letter, let a show cause notice be issued to him to 
explain as to why his name be not removed from the roll of the 
Advocates -on-Record in terms of Order IV rule 31 of the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980. Similarly, let a show cause notice be 
issued to Mr. Nasir Ali Shah, Solicitor General, Ministry of Law to 
explain as to why he made an incorrect  statement before the 
Court , as a result whereof he had not only embarrassed the 
whole institution, but also the Federal Government and why an 
appropriate recommendation as envisaged by the law be not 
made  against him .
