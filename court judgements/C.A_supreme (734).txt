ORDER 
 
   The lis at hand pertains to the 
implementation of the judgment dated 
04.05.2018 of this Court passed in CMA 
No.376-K of 2014 in SMC No.16 of  2011 in 
respect of Bahria Town Limited, Karachi (BTLK). 
While deciding the matter of BTLK, it was 
noticed by this Court that the third party rights 
had been created, which may require protection 
and in the above context, the possibility of 
transfer of rights of the land in question in 
favour of BTLK be considered. Such third party 
rights are obviously of the allottees of various 
plots and the buildup units of BTLK and, as per 
the case of BTLK, the number of such allottees 
exceeds 1,40,000 (CMAs Nos.109 & 1638 of 
2019). There is no denying the fact that some 
development work has been undertaken by 
BTLK upon the land in question and it is 
claimed, though not verified, that several CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  5 
 
hundred billions of rupees have been expended, 
in this behalf.  
2.  At the very outset, it was canvassed on 
behalf of BTLK that they are prepared to pay 
the price of the land in question and complete 
the project thereby guaranteeing the protection 
and preservation of third party rights and also 
ensuring that reasonable value of the land goes 
into the public exchequer. The implementation 
proceedings before this Court were punctuated 
by various offers made by BTLK. In this behalf, 
there were successive miscellaneous 
applications and offers made in open Court 
duly recorded in the various orders of this 
Court. The last offer was made through CMA 
No.2232 of 2019 and in broad terms, such offer 
is reflected in our previous Order dated 
13.03.2019. The aforesaid process had the 
blessings and consent with the Government of 
Sindh and Malir Development Authority, as 
recorded in our order dated 13.03.2019. 
3.   Today, in Court, BTLK has revised and 
enhanced its offer. The final offer, as it stands CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  6 
 
now, with its terms and conditions is as 
follows:- 
 (a) The land in question:   
(1) BTLK has offered to acquire the 
rights of the land measuring 16,896 
acres (sixteen thousand eight hundred 
and ninety six acres) in 5 Dehs i.e. Deh 
Bolhari, Deh Langhaji, Deh Konkar, Deh 
Kharkharo and Deh Kathore the details 
are identified in the site plan, which is 
prepared by SUPARCO and agreed upon 
by SUPARCO, Survey of Pakistan and the 
Representative of BTLK, which also bears 
the signatures of the Representative of 
BTLK pursuant to our order dated 
09.01.2019. The said site plan is already 
available and is placed on the record 
marked as “C”. BTLK has no right, title, 
interest or possession of any other land 
owned by the Government of Sindh other 
than 16,896 acres.  
(2) During the course of 
proceedings, it came to light that BTLK 
has allotted plots to the persons in the 
land though not part of 16896 acres of 
land distinctly identified in site plan “C”. 
This fact stands reflected in our order 
dated 06.3.2019. BTLK has undertaken 
to adjust such allottees in 16,896 acres 
as marked in site plan “C” or to 
compensate them in monetary terms. CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  7 
 
Such undertaking by BTLK is reflected in 
our aforesaid order dated 06.03.2019.  
 
(b) Price of Land  
BTLK has agreed to pay a total sum 
of Rs.460,000,000,000/- (Rupees Four 
Hundred and Sixty billion), to be paid in 
the following manner: 
(1) Period:

Government of Sindh) will be 
paid. Shortfall in such payment 
shall be made up on or before 
27th August of 2019.  
(ii) Subsequent Payments: 
Payment shall be made firstly, 
in forty-eight (48) monthly

million) starting from 1st 
September, 2019.   
    Thereafter, the balance 
payments shall be made in 
thirty-six equal monthly 
installments along with 4% 
markup charged annually w.e.f. 
1st September, 2023. 
 In the event of default in 
repayments, BTLK shall be 
liable to pay markup on any 
defaulted sum at the rate of 
10% per annum. This shall be 
in addition to other penal 
consequences provided in this 
order.   
(iii) Each monthly installment shall 
be paid/settled in full by the 7th 
day of each month in advance.  
(iv) 30% of outstanding amount of 
BTLK towards its allottees as

be utilized towards the Down 
Payment and installments 
mentioned above, as the case 
may be.  CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  9 
 
   BTLK undertakes to 
provide within fifteen days the

which such payments are to be

shall furnish personal 
guarantees to the 
satisfaction of the Registrar 
of this Court whereby they 
shall be jointly and severally 
liable for any default which 
may be committed by BTLK

financial interests of the 
Province of Sindh/Malir 
Development Authority safe, 
harmless and indemnified 
until the whole of the

  (e) Other Terms and Conditions:  
(1) BTLK is permitted to allot 
and otherwise deal with 
16896 acres the property in 
question as a builder/ 
developer only. 
(2) On receipt of entire payment 
as mentioned above, 
leasehold rights in the 
property in question of 
16896 acres may be 
transferred on lease by the 
Government of Sindh 
and/or the Malir 
Development Authority to 
BTLK for a period of 99 
years or such other tenure 
in accordance with the 
applicable laws and BTLK 
shall in accordance with the 
terms and conditions 
already agreed with the 
allottees transfer or cause to 
be transferred such rights in 
favour of the said allottees.  CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  13 
 
 (3) BTLK shall complete the 
project and all constructions 
shall be compliant with all 
the applicable laws, rules 
and regulations including 
Sindh Building Control 
Authority Laws. 
(4) As this order relates to only 
16,896 acres of land in (deh) 
falling within the controlled 
area of MDA, The 
Government of Sindh  and 
the MDA shall ensure that 
any land beyond this stands 
retrieved and no excess land 
shall be allowed to be 
occupied by BTLK. Any 
violation of this direction 
shall entail criminal action 
both against the 
functionaries of Government 
of Sindh, Malir Development 
Authority and the 
management of BTLK or 
whosoever is found 
responsible.  CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  14 
 
 
 
4.   As stated above, we are enjoined by 
the judgment dated 04.05.2018 under 
implementation to, as far as possible, protect 
the third party rights in the land in question. 
Such third parties obviously are the allottees 
and as per the case of BTLK the number of 
such allottees is over 140000. It is also an 
obvious fact that though development work has 
been conducted on the site at a cost of several 
billion rupees (as per the case of BTLK), 
however, the project is far from complete. The 
most efficient way of securing the rights of third 
parties i.e. the allottees is through the 
completion of the project and handing over the 
developed plots and/or completed constructed 
units, as the case may be, to such allottees. 
5.  That in the judgment under 
implementation one of us (Faisal Arab, J.) had 
undertaken an exercise tentatively determined 
the approximate financial worth in the land in 
question. Reference, in this behalf, may be 
made to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the concurring CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  15 
 
note. As per the aforesaid exercise, the tentative 
financial advantage that Malir Development 
Authority would have acquired, had it 
undertaken a scheme itself was                     
Rs.150,000,000,000/- for 7068 acres. The land 
in question is 16896 acres and applying the 
same formula, the approximate monetary 
benefit of the land would be about 
Rs.360,000,000,000/- The offer made by BTLK 
is about Rs.100 billion more than the aforesaid 
amount, which, perhaps more than 
compensates for deferred payments in 
installments.  
6.  We accept the offer of 
Rs.460,000,000,000/- (Rupees Four Hundred 
and Sixty billion) made by BTLK for 16,896 
acres of land on terms as set out hereinabove 
(this amount translates into Rs.27.22 million 
per acre). 
7.  As per the judgment under 
implementation dated 04.5.2018, we had 
directed the National Accountability Bureau to 
commence the investigation against BTLK with CMA No.8758-2018 etc.  16 
 
regard to the land in question. Such direction 
was reiterated vide our order dated 14th 
November, 2018. We were subsequently 
informed that the investigation perhaps has 
been completed and the reference has also been 
prepared and is ready to be filed in the 
Accountability Court. In this view of the matter, 
the said Reference shall not be filed for the time 
being. However, if there is any default in 
making payments in terms of the aforesaid 
order or otherwise any other violation in any of 
the terms and conditions mentioned herein 
above, NAB shall immediately file said 
Reference, which shall be proceeded with in 
accordance with law. 
8.  To come up for further proceedings 
after a fortnight.
