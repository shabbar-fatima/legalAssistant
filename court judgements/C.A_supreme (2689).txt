ORDER  
 
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.  – Dr. Babar 
Awan was enrolled as Advocate of this Court on 29.05.2000 and status 
of Sr. AS C was conferred upon him on 29.05.2008. Presently, he is 
appearing in Reference No. 1 of 2011 sent by the President of Pakistan 
under Article 186 of the Constitution. Hearing of the Reference, 
considering it to be one of the most important matters, is pend ing in 
this Court for the last few months. On 04.01.2012, a notice of 
contempt of Court was issued to him by a Bench of this Court 
comprising two Hon’ble Judges in respect of a press conference 
addressed by him on 01.12.2011. After receipt of notice, he ad dressed 
the electronic media at the podium of the Supreme Court Gate and 
perhaps when inquired from him about issuance of the notice, he 
stated that in the past too , criminal cases were registered against him 
when he was conducting the cases of Mohtarama B enazir Bhutto and 
the incumbent President Mr. Asif Ali Zardari and concerning the 
contempt notice issued to him, he uttered the following words: -  
 
This utterance made on the electronic media was telecast by different 
channels, which believably had been seen by a large number of  
people. The content of the utterance, the gestures made and the body 
language were indicative of an attempt to ridicule the Court. We have REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 0 5.01.2012  3 
inquired from Dr. Babar Awan  about it , who instead of denying the 
same, stated that the wo rds uttered on the television in fact reflected 
respect. To fully appreciate the content and the manner of what he 
said, we asked the Secretary Information to make arrangement for 
displaying the relevant video clips. Accordingly, on multimedia affixed 
in the courtroom, DVD was played which was not only watched by the 
senior members of the bar, but also by Mr. Yasin Azad, President, 
Supreme Court Bar Association and Mr. Latif Afridi, Vice Chairman, 
Pakistan Bar Council . Both of them have condemned the same. Mr. 
Latif Afridi went to the extent of saying that these things should not 
have happened and in any case he would stand by the judiciary in the 
matter. We believe that interaction between the Bench and the Bar 
depends upon mutual respect . Irrespective of the fact which Bench 
issued the notice, the fact remains that it was part of the judiciary, 
therefore, a person who is a senior counsel appearing before the 
Supreme Court, instead of uttering the words reproduced above and 
making gestures as if he had no ca re for the issuance of the notice 
because prior to the utterance under consideration, he said that in the 
past too he had been charged with criminal cases for conducting the 
cases of Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari . We do not 
know those facts , but prima  facie, we are of the view that the conduct 
of Dr. Babar Awan is unbecoming of an Advocate of the Supreme 
Court, therefore, we issue notice to him under Rule 30 of Order IV of 
the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 to explain as to why his name be not 
removed from the Roll of the Advocates of this Court.  
2.   Registrar is directed to hand over copies of the notice and 
the DVD to Dr. Babar Awan , which shall be furnished to him by the 
Secretary Information during the course of the day. He may file reply REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 0 5.01.2012  4 
to the notice on or before 09.01.2012. Proceedings of the Reference 
are also postponed till the next date of hearing.
