ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.  – Attention 
of Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, who is instructed by Mr. M.S. Khattak , AOR  
was drawn towards the following questions of law, which according to 
them arise for consi deration in the instant appeal: -  
Questions 45, 51 &  52  
45. Could a Prime Minister  who undid the draconian action of a 
military dictator (of arresting judges of the superior courts, 
including the Hon’ble Chief Justice and his children) even ICA No. 1/2012  2 
before he had taken oath as Prime Minister , be presumed to 
have contem plated committing contempt?  
51. Whether it is not ironic that a Prime Minister  who released 
the detained judges should be sent to prison, or sentenced 
otherwise, by the judiciary?  
52. Can the duly elected Prime Minister  of Pakistan not even 
expect to be dealt wi th in a manner similar to real, actual 
and blatant contemners of the variety that:  
 Sacked the superior courts and their judges in November 
2007;  
 Expressly and brazenly flouted the historic order dated 
November 3, 2007;  
 Arrested the judges of the superio r courts along with 
their children members of their families, detained and 
continued to hold them captive for prolonged periods;  
 Promulgated and/or applied and administered anti -
judiciary laws such as the PCO and the Judges, Oath of 
Office Order;  
 Unleash ed brutal state violence on Members of the Bar 
(as officers of the Court) and other citizens of Pakistan 
seeking the reinstatement of the sacked judges;  
But have yet to be formally charged and indicted for their 
patently criminal actions?  
They were furth er apprised that the questions reproduced hereinabove 
were phrased in such a manner, which should not have been recorded  
by the appellant who is the incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan and is 
supposed to possess high est moral values being the constitution al head 
and the impression is being created as if the judiciary as a whole is 
being influenced on account of alleged favourable actions done by him 
for its members by performing the  acts noted therein. Therefore it is 
tantamount not to embarrass the Court,  but the appellant himself as he 
ought not to have claimed relief or presumed that some relief should be 
given  to him  for such action. The learned counsel appearing on his ICA No. 1/2012  3 
behalf, however, stated that these questions were framed with a view 
to show respect  and deference to the judiciary and in no manner it 
should be considered that perhaps the judiciary is being influenced for 
any purpose. However, under instructions received from the learned 
AOR of the appellant, he stated at the bar that the above questio ns be 
deleted from the pleadings.  
2.   On having considered the request of the learned counsel 
and also considering that the above questions are being required  to be 
deleted under instructions from the appellant through his AOR, we 
accede to the request s o made. Consequently, questions No. 45, 51 
and 52 are deleted from the pleadings.  
3.   Similarly, in the CMAs wherever these questions have been 
repeated shall be deemed to have been deleted under instructions 
received by the learned counsel for the appel lant through his AOR.  
4.   Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan , Sr. ASC  is continuing with his 
arguments, which are not likely to be concluded in the course of the 
day. It is already 4.00 p.m., as such the case is adjourned for 
10.02.2012.
