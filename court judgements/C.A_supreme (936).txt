IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN 
(Appellate Jurisdiction) 
Bench-V: 
Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah 
Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik 
Civil Petition No.600 of 2020. 
(Against the order of Lahore High Court, Lahore  
dated 04.02.2020 passed in WP No.67 of 2020)  
Attiq ur Rehman      ...…. Petitioner(s) 
Versus 
Sh. Tahir Mehmood and others   ….Respondent(s) 
For the petitioner(s): Dr. G.M. Choudhary, ASC. 
Respondent(s):  N.R. 
Date of hearing:  26.01.2023 
ORDER  
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Respondent No.1 through a 
constitutional petition challenged the initiation of inquiry against him on 
the charges of which he already stood exonerated in three previous 
inquiries. He contended before the High Court that the Chief Minister’s 
Inspection Team has no authority to initiate the said inquiry against him. 
On the basis of these submissions the High Court issued notices to other 
side and granted interim relief to respondent No.1 on 03.1.2020 to the 
effect that no adverse orders be passed against him. The said interim relief 
was further extended vide order dated 04.2.2020. 
2.  It is the settled policy of this Court not to readily interfere in 
the interim orders passed by the High Court. It is desirable that the court 
hearing the case finally decides the same before it is brought before this 
court as piecemeal adjudication is not desirable. The only exception is 
when the interim relief granted by the High Court is arbitrary or 
unreasonable or reflects abuse of power or wanton exercise of discretion 
resulting in miscarriage of justice1. We have examined the impugned 
interim order and find that it does not suffer from any grave illegality or 
abuse of process or gross injustice. We are, therefore, not inclined to 
interfere in the impugned order. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed 
and leave refused.
