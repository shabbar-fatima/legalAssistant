 The learned Attorney General has continued with his 
submissions today. The matter is partly heard. He has reiterated 
commitments made on 21.07.2023 and recorded in the order of 
that date. At the end of the hearing today, he on instructions from 
the concern ed quarters informed the Court that the matter of 
providing an appeal on facts and law against conviction by a 
court martial is under serious consideration. Seeks further time 
in this regard.   
2.  He has on previous occasions already stated at the 
Bar, on  instructions from the Federal Government, that there will 
be no trials of the persons in military custody without informing 
the Court. Today the learned Attorney General has repeated that 
assurance on instructions specifically obtained from the highest 
military authorities under the Army Act. We are confident that 
this commitment will be adhered to and trials shall not 
commence without informing the Court. The learned Attorney CONST. P. 24 OF 2023 ETC.
