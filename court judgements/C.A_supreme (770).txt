ORDER  
Qazi Faez Isa, J . This petition for leave to appeal assails the order dated 5 
November 2020  of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi . On the last date of 
haring, we had directed the petitioner to file the show cause notice, 
through which the whole process was re -initiated and show cause notice 
dated 23 May 2011 has been filed through CMA No.23 -K/2022 , which 
shows that it was issued ‘under section 66A read with section 66 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 for the assessment year 97 -98…’. The two 
questions framed by the Department for consideration of the High Court 
in the Income Tax Reference w ere as under : 
 
i. Whether under the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the learned Tribunal was justified to hold that 
order u/s 66 -A of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 
1979, was barred by time limit?  
 
ii. Whether under the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the learned Tribunal was justifi ed to decide the 
appeal against the department in the context of case 
law cited as 2008 PTD 1316?  
 
2. The Department before the High Court had relied u pon section 66 -A 
of the Income Tax Ordinance ( and not section 66) . Under the said section 
66-A, a notice can only be issued within a period of four years  by an Civil Petition No. 4-K of 20 21 
 
 
 2
Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Income Tax  from the date of an 
order passed by the Deputy Commissioner. Therefore, we enquired when 
was the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner and were told t hat it 
was passed on 16 March 1998 (filed with CMA No. 25 -K/2022 ). The said 
show cause notice dated 23 May 2011 was issued more than thirteen 
years after the said order and as such was time -barred  as it was well 
beyond the prescribed period of four years. R eference was then made to a 
notice dated 12 June 2013 . Leaving aside the relevancy of this notice we 
note that it too was issued after four years . The Department could not 
have initiated  action u nder the said section 66 -A after four years. 
Therefore, leave to appeal is declined and , consequently, this petition is 
dismissed with cost s in the sum of twenty thousand rupees .  
 
3. We may observe that the Income Tax Department , which is now  the 
Federal Board of Revenue , must  act fairly in dealing with taxpayers and to 
abide  by the law governing it . If any benefit accrues  to taxpayers  under 
the law, it must not be withh eld and the assessee’s  and its own time and 
resources  should not be needlessly wasted . This frivolous litigation  also 
wasted the time of the Tribunal, the High Court and of this Court; time 
which would have been b etter spent in resolving legitimate disputes.
