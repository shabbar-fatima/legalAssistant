ORDER  
 
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Issue raised in 
the captioned petitions is identical with the one earlier attended  
and disposed of  by this Court in a  good number of cases, vide 
order dated 14.04.2021 whereby bail petitions both pre as well as 
post arrest , in different NAB references , allowed by a learned 
Division Bench of High Court of Sin dh at Sukkur Bench, in lieu of 
deposit of amounts allegedly embezzled by the accused named 
therein , were remitted for decision afresh in accord with the law 
declared by this Court in the case of Talat Ishaq Vs. National 
Accountability Bureau  (PLD 2019 Supr eme Court 12).   2 
 
 
Civil Petition Nos.3031/2021, 1183/2021, 1184/2021 and 
1290/2021  
 
From amongst the petitioners, Hafiz Sohail (C.P.1183/2021 ), 
Muhammad Pariyal Solangi  (C.P.1184/2021 ) and Nasrullah  
(C.P. 1290/2021 ) are not in attendance, statedly, on account of 
Covid restrictions, standing in impediment to their journey  to the 
Court ; their attendance is dispensed with ; they, along with  
co-accused , present before the Court , by impugned orders, each 
structured on consent, have been admitted to pre -arrest bail s in 
different NAB references  with a direction to furnish deposi ts 
equivalent to  the amounts allegedly embezzled by them at the cost 
of public exchequer. Such directions for release of an accused on 
bail have since been held by this Court as ultra vires in judgments 
more than one . An accused seeking bail desires transf er of his 
custody from Superintendent of the Jail , where he is confined , to 
his surety who undertakes his production as and when required by 
the Court  and for that he has to make out a case in accordance 
with the law applicable thereto ; he cannot be allowe d or required to 
barter his freedom . In the supra  case consideration s for grant of 
post arrest bail to an accused confronting charge under the NAB 
Ordinance have clearly been illustrated, therefore, an accused 
facing indictment in a NAB reference has to qu alify the parameters 
set down in the supra  case; there is no other way out . Similarly, 
grant of pre -arrest bail  in a cognizable/non -bailable  offence  is a 
remedy, most extraordinary in the nature of judicial protection,  
extended by  diverting usual course of  law for the sole purpose of 
protecting  reputation and honour of  an innocent  citizen , being 
hounded through abuse of process of law  for purposes sinister and 
oblique ; the protection is based upon equity and cannot be 
extended in every run of the mill crimi nal case  prima facie  founded 
upon  incriminatory evidence , warranting custody for investigative 
purposes . The protection was devised  in Hidayat Ullah Khan’s case  
(PLD 1949 Lahore 1 ) and the principles laid down therein are being 
faithfully followed till dat e; impugned orders being inconsistent 
therewith cannot sustain . Petitions are converted into appeals and 
allowed; orders impugned are set aside. Bail petitions filed by the 
appellants before the High Court of Sindh shall be deemed as 
pending for decisions afresh;  they shall remain on ad-interim bail 
upon furnishing bonds in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety 
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Deputy Registrar 3 
 
 
Civil Petition Nos.3031/2021, 1183/2021, 1184/2021 and 
1290/2021  
 
(Judicial) of Sukkur Bench  before fall of 3rd week of the month; 
they shall appear  in person  before the Court on a date notified by 
the office . It is expected that the petitions shall be 
decided/disposed of with all convenient dispatch on their own 
merits having regard to the law declared by this Court .
