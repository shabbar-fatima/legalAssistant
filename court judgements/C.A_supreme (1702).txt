ORDER  
 
   IFTIK HAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY , CJ. — The learned 
Attorney General for Pakistan appeared in response to the Court’s  
notice  to assist the Court regarding the allocati on of funds to the 
Parliamentarians under Peoples Work Programme -I (PWP -I)/Tamir -e-
Watan Programme  as well as Peoples Work Programme -II (PWP -II) 
and criteria/procedure along  with results of the allocated funds , which 
ultimately belonged to the taxpayers. He is also required to assist the 
Court in terms of the Constitution and the law on the subject 
conce rning the exercise of discretion by the Prime Minister keeping in 
view the requirement of transparency in distribution of public funds 
and execution of development works.   
2.   As far as PWP -II is concerned, it has a budgetary allocation 
of Rs.22 billions,  to be distributed by the Prime Minister in his 
discretion. The m aterial produced during hearing of the case  suggests 
that upto 16.03.2013 the volume of allocated amount was increased 
upto Rs.47 billions . Details of slashing funds from other Heads to 
increase it s volume have already been mentioned in the earlier order.   
3.     Raja Parvez Ashraf, f ormer Prime Minister  of Pakistan 
extend ed favour s to the Senators, Members of the National Assembly, 
Provincial Assemblies, Notables and other functionaries by generously Const. P. No. 20/2013, etc.  3 
distribut ing funds out of this programme  in the name of so called 
development scheme s. A major chunk of the amount of this  fund has 
been distributed close to the completion of p eriod of his government , 
i.e., on 15/16 March, 2013 as directions were  issued from his office to 
the A GPR to disburse the amount s to various Federal and Provincial 
execu ting agencies , such as , PWD, SNGPL, PEPCO , etc. Funds were

and Mr. Basharat Mehmood, all belonging to District Chakwal, were the 
Notab les, to whom the funds  were given. Not only this, in one of the

5.  Besides, when we commenced the hearing of the case an 
attempt was made to release the outstanding amount by signing 
cheques by M/S Khalid Qureshi and Khalid Malik, XENs CCD -II & IV, 
Pak. PWD, Islamabad, knowing well about the penden cy of the case 
before this Court, b ut with  the departmental intervention they were 
restrained from issuing cheques out of the amount which so far ha d 
not been spent and t hey have been placed under suspension.  
6.   Prima facie we are of the opinion that the re must be some 
criteria for allocat ion of such funds because the Parliamentarians, 
Members of the Provincial Assemblies, other functionaries/  
officers/officials and other persons (Notables) who received such 
amounts in the name of development schemes cannot be permitted to 
be benefitted from such funds , and discre tion has not been exercised 
in allocating the funds  in a transparent manner.   Const. P. No. 20/2013, etc.  5 
7.   Having  considered the above scenario, we direct as 
under :-  
(i) Notice be issued to the former Prime Minister Raj a Pervez 
Ashraf , whose name is appearing in the list  of recipient s of 
funds from PWP -II for development works in the 
Constituency from where he was elected as Member of the 
National Assembly  with a view to provid ing him an 
opportunity of hearing in the mat ter;   
(ii) Notice s to all other beneficiaries of funds of PWP -II 
including the Parliamentarians, Members of the Provincial 
Assemblies, Notables , etc., be also issued after obtain ing 
the list from Malik Manzoor Akhter, DG, Audit . The latter is  
also require d to effect service upon all of them at their 
addresses separately through the executing agencies, 
details of which are available in CMA No.3974/2013 
furnished by  him;   
(iii) To ensure service upon all concerned , complete list of the 
beneficiaries includi ng theirs names and details of the 
funds allocated to them be uploaded on the website of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan  (www.supremecourt.gov.pk ), 
enabling them to respon d to the notices and put forward 
their view point/defence, if they so desire ;   
(iv) Notice s be also issued to Pak PWD, SNGPL, PEPCO as well 
as the Chief Secretaries of all the Provinces to effect 
service upon all the executing agencies which allegedly 
executed the work s, after having collected the details from 
the office of DG, Audit in respect of the schemes executed 
at the Federal and Provincial levels . The representatives of 
the Chief Secretaries may , if need be,  collect the relevant 
informati on from the office of DG, Audit;   
(v) The executive a gencies, both Federal and Provincial, shall 
also submit the details of the status/  
performance/ completion or otherwise of the development 
schemes, which have been executed out of the funds Const. P. No. 20/2013, etc.  6 
allocated for the purpose , enabling this Court to pass 
appropriate orders ;  
(vi) The executing agencies shall not release funds to the 
contractors/persons etc. , who were deputed to execute 
such development works, etc., nor these funds shall be 
considered to have been lapsed  on account of the close of 
Financial Year as it has already been order ed on 
24.06.2013 , pending decisi on of the case;  
(vii) It is stated that the idea of allocating funds to the 
Parliamentarians , etc. was introduced by late Dr. 
Mehboob -ul-Haq, a renowned Economist of his times when 
Members of the Parli ament were elected in non -party 
elections. Such recommendations/report, if available, be 
submitted by the Planning Commission for our perusal and 
a copy thereof be also supplied to the learned Attorney 
General ; and   
(viii) The Secretaries Finance and the Economic Affairs Division s
