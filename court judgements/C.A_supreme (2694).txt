ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR M UHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ . – Barrister 
Kamal Azfar, Sr. ASC has appeared and stated that he has not 
been instructed by the Federation to argue this case . According 
to him,  he has failed to understand as to why the Federation is 
not willing to proceed with the c ase. As far as legal position  on 
the subject is concerned, it has already been explained in the 
yesterday’s order . However,  in addition to that, it may be 
observed that the provision of Order XXVI rule 26 of the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980 in substance is th e same as it was in 
the Supreme Court Rules, 1956 under Order XXVI rule 5. It is to 
be noted that the Supreme Court Rules are framed under the CRP 129/201 0 etc. 
Order dt. 12.04.2011  
 3 
provisions of the Constitution and any departure from the same 
will not serve the ends of justice , as held by this Court time and 
again, reference to which has already been made in the 
yesterday’s order.  
2.   Mr. K.K. Agha, learned Additional Attorney General for 
Pakistan earlier appeared today and stated that the Federation 
intend ed to file an application challengi ng vires of rule 6 of Order 
XXVI, but no such application was placed on record. However, 
during course of discussion, following in substance the rule 6 of 
Order XXVI, Mr. K.K. Agha was pointed out that he himself had 
assisted Barrister Kamal Azfar in the h earing of the petitions , 
therefore, he would argue the case by adopting the certificate, 
which was earlier filed by Mr. Masood Ahmed Chishti,  ASC (now 
Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice ) as was adopted by Barrister 
Kamal Azfar, although originally  no suc h certificate was filed by 
the latter. At this, he  sought time to have instructions from the 
Federation, which was granted, but  on his return he stated that 
he was not given any specific instructions, therefore, he need ed 
some more time. Mr. Abdul Hafeez P irzada, learned Sr. ASC for 
the caveator pointed out that no deviation was possible from the 
provision of rule 6 of Order XXVI as this Court ha d, in a large 
number of cases, declined to grant such permission , and 
according to him there was wisdom in it because in such a n 
eventuality  there would be no end to litigation and the learned 
counsel who had argued the case and signed the certificate 
would be substituted by adopting th e practice as the Federatio n CRP 129/201 0 etc. 
Order dt. 12.04.2011  
 4 
might intend to adopt in this case ; therefore , he wou ld oppose it 
if such permission was accorded , as according to him , it was  
settled position of the law preva iling for the last many decades 
and no deviation was called for. We are fully conscious of the 
constitutional provision s as well as the rule referred  to 
hereinabove. However, to provide another opportunity to Mr. 
K.K. Agha to seek instructions in this behalf , we adjourn the case 
to 14.04.2011.
