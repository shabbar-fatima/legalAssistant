ORDER  
 
  The l earned Additional Attorney General for 
Pakistan has referred to the contents of our order dated 
25.05.2022 (afternoon)  and our judgment dated 26. 05.2022 
passed in Constitution Petition No.19 of 2022. From the 
conte nts of the said order , he has pointed out  that the 
following undertakings were given by Dr. Babar Awan, 
learned Sr.ASC  and Mr. Faisal Fareed, learned ASC  on behalf 
of the Respondent,  Mr. Imran Khan, Chairman, Pakistan 
Tehreek -e-Insaf  (“PTI”) for holdi ng PTI ’s rally in the ground 
situat ed between  Sector s H-9 and G-9, Islamabad : 
i. The rally will not caus e any inconvenience at  or 
blockage of Srinagar Highway ; 
ii. No inconvenience will be caused to the public and 
citizenry  at large; and  Crl.O.P.148/22 IN Const.P.19/22

iii. The rally will be conduc ted in a peaceful and lawful 
manner with out damag ing any  public or private 
propert y.  
He has then re ad to us material from the reports filed by the 
Islamabad Capital Territory (“ICT”), Intelligence Bureau 
(“IB”) and Inter -Services Intelligence ( “ISI”) in answer to the 
questions posed in paragraph -7 of our judgment dated 
26.05.2022 . After reading extract s from the said reports , the 
learned Additional Attorney General has submitted that the 
persons who gave the undertaking s as well as the person on 
whose beha lf the said undertaking s were given breached the 
same attracting the offence specified in  Section 3 read with 
Section 2(a)  of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003  
(“Ordinance ”). He has accordingly urged that contempt 
proceedings be initiated against the Respondent and his two 
learned counsel  named above  for their role and liability as 
accessories .  
2.  We have read the material and examined the 
provisions of the Ordinance  and Order XXVII  of the Supreme  
Court Rules, 1980 . At the present stage, it is necessa ry that 
the factual aspects of the alleged breach of the undertakings 
be ascertained  at a prima facie  level. This is because  although  
the events  that followed the order dated  25.05.2022  
(afternoon ) and the evidentiary  material  collected 
subsequently  by the  Agencies  are damaging , the role and 
liability of the Respondent  as an absent party before the 
Court  is still  not clear. Accordingly, we direct that the office 
shall serve the reports submitted by the three Agencies Crl.O.P.148/22 IN Const.P.19/22  
 3
together with Criminal M .A.No.18 25 of 20 22 filed in Criminal 
Original Petition No.148/2022 , upon Mr. Imran K han, 
Chairman PTI, Dr. Babar Awan, learned Sr.ASC and Mr. 
Faisal Fareed, learned ASC to enable them  to file their replies 
to the same . The said persons shall also answer the 
allegations le veled by the learned Additional Attorney General 
for Pakistan  in light of the material referred through written 
replies filed on or before 31.10.2022 . Thereafter, r e-list in the 
same week . 
3.  When conf ronted with our query as to the 
maintainability of Crl.M.A.No. 1738 of 2022 , filed under 
Article 187 of the Constitution , seeking interim relief , the 
learned Additional Attorney  General for Pakistan  has sought  
time to obtain instructions  and assist  us in the matter . This 
order shall also be implemented by the office mutatis 
mutandis  in respect of the petitioner  in Constitution  Petition  
No.19 of 2022 .
