SHORT ORDER  
 
  MIAN SAQIB NISAR, CJ -. The Preamble to the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
Constitution)  provides that, “sovereignty over the entire Universe 
belongs to Almighty Allah alone, and the authority to be exercised 
by the  people of Pakistan within the limits prescribed by Him is a 
sacred trust ”; .… “wherein the State shall exercise its powers and 
authority through the chosen representatives of the people; 
wherein the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance 
and social justice as enunciated by Islam shall be fully observed ”; 
…. “wherein shall be guaranteed fundamental rights, including 
equality of status, of opportunity and before law, social economic 
and political justice, and freedom of thought, expression, be lief, 
faith, worship and association, subject to law and public morality ”.  
 
2.  Article 17 of the Constitution grants to every citizen 
the fundamental right to form associations subject to any 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of 
sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, public order and / or morality.  
 
3.  An elected Parliament, adorned with the chosen 
representatives of people on the one hand and the rule of law on 
the other hand are the foundations of democracy under the 
Constitution. Articles 62, 63 and 63 -A of the Constitution create 
an integrated framework for ensuring that business of the 
Parliament is conducted by persons of probity, integrity and high 
moral character. These conditions are enforced by Articles 62 & 63 
of the Consti tution by prescribing qualifications and 
disqualifications for membership to the Parliament.  
  
4.  All laws pertaining to the election to Parliament and to 
participation in the proceedings thereof are to be read subject to 
such constitutional provisions in  the exercise of the rights 
guaranteed by Article 17 of the Constitution.  
 
5.  Under Article 63 -A of the Constitution, the position of 
a Party Head of a political party that has representation in, inter 
alia, the Parliament has a central role in the perfo rmance of duties 
by the Members of the Parliament. For rendering such a role, a 
Party Head must necessarily possess the qualifications and be free 
of the disqualifications contemplated in Articles 62 & 63 of the 
Constitution.  
 
6.  The Election Act, 2017 e mpowers a Party Head to 
perform multifarious functions that have direct nexus with the 
process of elections to the Parliament and to matters relating to the 
affairs of political parties having parliamentary presence.  
 
7.  Therefore for detailed reasons to  be recorded later, 
these Constitutional Petitions are allowed. It is held and declared 
that provisions of Sections 203 and 232 of the Election Act, 2017 
are liable to be read, construed and interpreted subject to the 
provisions of Articles 62, 63 and 63 -A of the Constitution.  
 
8.  As a consequence, it is declared that any person who 
suffers from lack of qualification under Article 62 or 
disqualification under Article 63 of the Constitution is debarred 
from holding the position of ‘Party Head’ by whatever n ame called 
and prohibited from exercising any of the powers provided in 
Article 63 -A of the Constitution, as ‘Party Head’ or any other power 
in the said capacity under any law, rule, regulation, statute, 
instrument or document of any political party. Such bar and 
prohibition shall commence from the date of disqualification and  
continue till such time that the lack of 
qualification/disqualification of such person continues in terms of 
the provisions of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.  
 
9.  As a resul t of the above declaration, all steps taken, 
orders passed, directions given and documents issued by 
Respondent No.4 as Party Head after his disqualification on 
28.07.2017 are also declared to have never been taken, passed, 
given or issued in the eyes of t he law. The Election Commission of 
Pakistan is accordingly directed to remove the name of Respondent 
No.4 (Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif) as President/Party Head of 
Respondent No.3 (Pakistan Muslim League (N) from all relevant 
record(s).
