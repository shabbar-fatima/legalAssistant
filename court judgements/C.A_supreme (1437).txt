        O R D E R  
 
 Jawwad S. Khawa ja, J.   The petitioners in all these petitions have  
prayed that the Federal Government be directed to lodge a complaint under Article 
6 of the Constitution  against the respondent Gen (Retd) Pervez Musharraf and 
others . The Federal Government had filed an i nitial statement which has been 
reprod uced in our order of 24.6 .2013. In the said order, we had asked the learned 
Attorney General to file a further statement “providing details of the actions envisioned 
by the Federal Government in the light of the presen t petitions and the process through 
which such actions will be given effect” . Pursuant to the said order of 24.6.2013, the 
learned Attorney General filed the following statement on 26.6.2013 :- 
“1. The Prime Minister has directed the Secretary Interior 
to forthwith direct the Director General FIA to constitute a 
special investigative team of senior officers to commence an 
inquiry and investigation in relation to the acts of General (R) 
Parvez Musharraf of 3rd November, 2007 that may amount to 
high treason un der Article 6 of the Constitution and to finalize 
as expeditiously as possible the statement of case to be put up by 
the Federal Government before the Special Court to be 
constituted under the Criminal Law Amendment (Special 
Courts) Act, 1976.  
2. The Law entrusts the investigation of the offence of high 
treason to the FIA under entry No.14 of the Schedule of the FIA 
Act, 1974 read with Section 3(a) and 6 thereof. However, in 
order to ensure expeditious completion of the inquiry and CP-2255/2010, etc.  3
investigation, the Prime  Minister is also considering the 
constitution of a Commission to oversee and monitor the 
progress of the proceedings.  
3. On the completion of the investigation, the Federal 
Government shall file the requisite complaint under Section 5 of 
the Criminal Law  Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1976 and 
take steps to constitute the Special Court in accordance with 
Section 4 of the said Act for the trial of the offence. ”  
  
2. The prayer in these petitions thus effectively appears to have been accepted 
by the Gover nment. Moreover, the learned counsel representing the petitioners had 
also expressed their satisfaction with the statement , subject only to a reservation 
that no time frame for the inquiry had been given for conclusion of the 
inquiry/investigation of the c ase which was to be initiated by the Government. The 
learned Attorney General has stated that the government has constituted an Inquiry 
Committee comprised of senior functionaries of the FIA and it will be upto the said 
Committee to undertake the investiga tion. We can expect that such investigation 
shall be concluded without unnecessary delay. We may also note that the learned 
counsel representing the respondent had also stated on the previous date of hearing 
that these matters to be brought to an end in vi ew of the statement filed by the 
Federal Government on 26.6.2013 as reproduced above.  In addition , we had also 
taken into consideration the resolution of the Senate dated  23.1.2012 and have taken 
judicial notice of the speech of the President and that of t he Prime Minister of 
Pakistan in the Parliament . 
3. We are consciously, deliberately and as submitted  by Mr. Muhammad 
Ibrahim Satti, learned  Sr. ASC for the respondent not touching the question of 
“abrogation ” or “subversion ” or “holding in abeya nce the Co nstitution ” or “any 
conspiracy  in that behalf ” or indeed the question of suspending or holding the 
Constitution in abeyance or the issue as to abetment or collaboration  in the acts 
mention ed in Article 6 of the Constitution . This is so because  any 
finding/ observation or view expressed by us may potentially result in prejudice to 
the inquiry/investigation or subsequent tri al should that take place as a result of 
such investigation.  CP-2255/2010, etc.  4
4. The Federal Government has, as noted above, proceeded in furtherance of i ts 
constitutional obligation envisioned in Article 6 of the Constitution and for the 
present this suffice s in terms of the said Article and the relief s respectively sought 
by the petitioners in these petitions. We, therefore, dispose of these petitions in the 
above terms with the observation that the Federal Government shall proceed as per 
undertaking dated 26.6.2013, reproduced above  without unnecessary delay .
