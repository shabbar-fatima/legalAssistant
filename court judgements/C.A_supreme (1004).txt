Against  the order  dated  30.4,2014  passed  by Islamabad  High  Court  in WP No. 4191 of 2013
Qazi  Faez  Isa, CJ. Eight  petitioners  had filed a writ petition  (WP No.4191  
of 2013) before  the Islamabad  High Court  against  Capital  Development  
Authority  ('CDA ’), the Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and Ch. 
Tahir  Sattar.  They  alleged  that ‘CDA has illegally,  unlawfully  changed  the 
Master  Plan and created  new Plots  No.295-A  to 295-H  and 296-A  to 296-B  
in the closed  end Street  No.56, Sector  F-11/4, Islamabad^  (‘the said plots ’) 
and had sought  a declaration  that CDA could  not do so and that it be 
restrained  from approving  the building  plans  in respect  of the said plots  
and be directed  to adhere  to the Master  Plan. The learned  Single  Judge  
allowed  the petitions,  cancelled  the said plots,  and further  directed  CDA  
to initiate  departmental  action  against  those  who had violated  the Master  
Plan.Mr. Muhammad  Nazir  Jawwad,  ASC

Against the judgment  dated  27.5.2014  passed  by Islamabad  High Court  in ICA No.249 of 2014A
2Civil  Petition  No,993/2014.  etc
2. Ch. Tahir Sattar had also filed a separate  writ petition  (WP 
No.41 19/2014)  seeking  to restrain  CDA from interfering  in the peaceful  
possession  and construction  of a house  on the Plot No.296-B,  which  he 
had purchased  from Ch. Saifullah  to whom it had been allotted.  His 
petition  was dismissed.  He assailed  the said judgments  in Intra Court  
Appeals  No. 249 and 250 of 2014,  but they were dismissed,  and the said 
decisions  are assailed  in CPLA  No. 1117 of 2014.
6. Learned  counsel  for CDA further  states  that the said plots formed  
part of land which  was designated  for ^Future  Use ’ in the Master  Plan  
which should  be given its ordinary  English  meaning,  that is that the 
same shall be utilized  in future  by CDA. Therefore,  allotments  of the 
same were to be allotted  as residential  plots since the area is a 
residential  area, and as such the Master  Plan was not violated.  He has 
also referred  to the amendment  made vide S.R.O  967(I)/2019,  dated  26 
August  2019, and stated  that the term ^Future  Use' used in the Master  
Plan is covered  by clause  2 (5) which  is reproduced  hereunder:4. Neither  the learned  Single  Judge  nor the learned  Judges  of the 
Division  Bench  of the High Court  realized  that only one private  allottee,  
namely,  Ch. Tahir Sattar,  was arrayed  as a respondent  before  the High  
Court  in WP No. 4191 of 2013. Therefore,  vide order dated 7 February  
2024 we had issued  notices  to the allottees/purchasers  of the remaining  
plots,  and CDA  was directed  to provide  particulars  thereof.3. CDA challenged  the order of the learned  Single  Judge  by directly  
filing  CPLA  No.993 of 2014  in this Court.  However,  since CPLA  No. 1117  
of 2014  has also been filed, and both assail  the same  judgments,  and as 
entertaining  CDA ’s petition  will not adversely  affect the interest  of the 
contesting  respondents,  we heard  both the cases.
5. Learned  counsel  representing  CDA referred  to CMA No.2464 of 
2024 and stated  that only four plots were allotted  by CDA, that is Plots  
No. 295-A,  295-B,  296-A  and 296-B  (‘the four plots ’). He also referred  to 
CMA No.2568 of 2024  and stated  that the four plots were allotted  to four 
persons  but since the same were encroached  upon, and there was 
procrastinated  litigation  going on between  CDA and the encroachers,  
alternate  allotments  of the four plots were made to them in the year  
2008, and that they had relinquished  all rights  to the earlier  allotments,  
which  stood  revoked/cancelled.

‘(5) Left-over/Un-designated/Un-planned/Un-utilized  Land  
means CDA acquired  land in Planned/Developed  Sectors/  
Schemes,  presently  not designated/earmarked/planned/  reserved  
for any specific  use and hence  reserved  for future  use/
CDA has filed documents,  through  CMA No.2568  of 2024, showing  the 
location  of the said plots which  are situated  on Street  No.56 of Sector  F- 
11/4; Plot NO.295-A  to 295-H  lie at the end of the street  on one side of 
the street,  and Plot Nos.296-A  and 296-B  are on the other side of the 
said street,  where  there are only two plots. Concluding  his submissions  
he states  that the remaining  six plots, which  have not been allotted  as 
yet, will be allotted  to those facing  similar  problems  and no fresh rights  
will be created.
7. The learned  Mr. Muhammad  Munir Paracha,  representing  Ch. 
Tahir  Sattar,  adopts  the submissions  of CDA ’s counsel  and further  states  
that the allotment  of the plot purchased  by him was made in 2008  
whereas  the petition  was filed in 2013, therefore,  the petition  was hit by 
the principle  of laches  and no explanation  for the belated  filing of the 
petition  was offered,  and that this was not even considered  in either  of 
the two decisions  which  have been assailed.  He further  states  that the 
said plots which include  Plot No. 296-B do not fall within an area  
designated  for any amenity  use or for any other specific  purpose.  The 
four plots, which  have been allotted,  have been allotted  for residential  
purposes  in a residential  area, and in making  such allotments  neither  
any law nor the Master  Plan was violated.  And, the allotments  were made  
to accommodate  those who could not avail of the benefit  of the plots  
earlier allotted to them because  they were encroached  upon. He 
concludes  by stating  that the High Court  also disregarded  the fact that 
considerable  investment  had already  been made in raising  construction  
on Plot No.296-B.
8. Learned  Malik  Nasrullah  Awan  represents  the private  respondents,  
who were the petitioners  before the High Court. The learned  counsel  
stated  that the said plots could not be earmarked  and allotted  because  
they were not shown  on the Master  Plan. However,  he was not able to 
point out any legal restriction  preventing  them from being allotted,  
particularly  when the said land was designated  on the Master  Plan for 
Future  Use. Learned  counsel  then contended  that by allotting  the said 
plots the rights  of the private  respondents  would  be adversely  affected  as 
the said plots were adjacent  to theirs  and would  restrict  light and air to

Naseertheir properties.  However,  when we called upon him to show us the 
allotment  orders of his clients  and whether  the same stipulated  any 
restriction,  the learned  counsel  stated  that the same had not been filed. 
We enquired  why the other allottees  were not arrayed  as parties  when  
their valuable  property  rights  could be, and were adversely  affected  by 
the impugned  decisions.  The learned  counsel  conceded  that they should  
have been arrayed  as parties.  The Master  Plan, the layout  plans  and the 
Google  map which  have been filed show the location  of the said plots,  
which  are at the end of Street  No. 56 and on the right side there is a 
narrow  lane separating  the last plot of one of the respondents  from Plot 
N0.295-A  whereas  the last plot of a respondent  on the other side of the 
street is separated  from Plot No.296-A  with a twenty-foot  wide lane.  
Therefore,  there  is no question  of the obstruction  of light and air. In any 
case an easement  right, if any, could not have been agitated  in the 
constitutional  jurisdiction  of the High Court,  nor in fact was this done.
10. Therefore,  for the aforesaid  reasons,  these petitions  are converted  
into appeals  and allowed  by setting  aside the judgments  of the High  
Court dated 30 April 2014 and 27 May 2014, and by restoring  the 
cancelled  allotments.  All listed  applications  are disposed  of.9. The learned  counsel  could  not show  what particular  rights  of the 
private  respondents  had been violated  in allotting  the said plots but he 
could not do so nor did he refer to any law which  prevented  CDA from  
utilizing,  for the benefit  of earlier  allottees,  land designated  for 'Future  
Use'. The term 'Future  Use'  does not mean  that the land is to be left open  
nor does it mean  that it is to be used for amenity  purposes,  which  may,  
have prohibited  their allotment.  Regretfully,  these points were not 
considered  by the learned  Judges  of the High Court.
