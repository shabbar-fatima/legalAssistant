ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ . -  Vide order dated 
15.10.2010 while disposing of CMA to the extent of the matter of 
withdrawal of executive order/notification vis-à-vis rest oration of 
Judges dated 16.03.2009 pronounced by this Court in Sindh High 
Court Bar Association's case , final order was passed and in Paragraph 
8(i) of the order following directions were issued: -  
“8. In the  light of the above, we direct: -  
 
(i) All the con stitutional and State 
functionaries and administrative heads in 
the country to ensure that no action qua 
initiation of proceedings concerning 
withdrawal of the executive order (order 
of “restoration of Judges”) dated CMA NO. 2981 OF 2010  
IN CONST.P. 9 OF 2009  3 
16.03.2009, status whereof has already 
been determined by this Court in its 
judgment in Sindh High Court Bar 
Association's case  (supra ), is taken, 
intentionally or otherwise, by any of the 
functionaries as noted hereinabove, and 
all the constitutional and administrative 
heads/functionaries are 
restrained/refrained from doing so.”   
 
2.  The learned Attorney General for Pakistan  has stated that 
in compliance with the order of the Court dated 15.10.2010 whereby 
he was required to communicate immediately the said order to all 
concerned, he has serv ed the same upon 105 constitutional and State 
functionaries and administrative heads  and also has already sent the 
compliance report to the Registrar.    
3.   The matter was postponed to enable the authorities/ 
functionaries to put up report and statements,  if desired. As far as 
reference to the statement is concerned, it pertains to the denial 
issued by the Chief Executive/Prime Minister, although the matter was 
finally disposed of, but to know about the desire of the concerned 
functionaries , the matter was  fixed  for today . The learned Attorney 
General for Pakistan  has categorically stated that no one has desired 
to submit a statement. Be that as it may, as the case has been 
disposed of by a binding order in terms of Article 189 read with Article 
190 of the Constitution , as noted hereinabove, therefore, it is up to the 
concerned authorities/functionaries to submit the statement or not.  
4.   According to Paragraph 8(ii) of the order dated 
15.10.2010, the Government of Pakistan/ Prime Minister was required 
to conduct an inquiry through an appropriate responsible functionary 
that if the statement of the former that no such action was being CMA NO. 2981 OF 2010  
IN CONST.P. 9 OF 2009  4 
contemplated was true, then how th at news in the print and electronic 
media was spread, and who was responsible for it , the l earned 
Attorney General for Pakistan  has submitted that a Committee 
comprising of the following persons has been constituted: -  
(1) Mr. Hameed Haroon, President , All 
Pakistan Newspapers’ Society :   Chairman  
(2) Mr. Muhammad Aslam Kazi, 
Secretary General, Pakistan   
Broadcasters ’ Association :    Member  
(3) Mr. Pervez Shoukat, President,  
Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists : Member  
(4) Mr. Najibullah Khan, Joint secretary,  
Ministry of Interior, Islamabad :   Member  
(5) Dr. Abdul Jabbar, Executive Member,  
PEMRA :       Member  
(6) Mr. Muhammad Azam, Director  
General (IP) M/O Information  
& Broadcasting :       Member  
 
He further submitted that preliminary observations of the Committee 
of Inquiry serve as an interim report. Perusal of the observations 
indicates that in one of the P aragraphs, appropriate expressions have 
not been used for which the Court has its reservations and it wants to 
make it clear that the judiciary believes in the rule of law and 
constitutionalism and is performing  its duty , and shall continue to 
perform it in future as well, according to the Constitution. However, 
the Committee may remove such expression in due course  of time .  
5.  The learned Attorney General for Pakistan  has stated that 
as the Committee could not complete its deliberations, therefore, for 
submitting final report, further time be given. We concede to the 
request so made by him. Case is adjourned  to a d ate in office. CMA NO. 2981 OF 2010  
IN CONST.P. 9 OF 2009  5 
However, on receipt of the report from the Committee, if need be, 
matter shall be heard in Court.
