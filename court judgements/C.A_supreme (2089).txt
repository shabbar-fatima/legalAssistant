ORDER  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Respondent is a textile 
unit, set up in Gado on Amazai,  incorporated under the Companies 
Ordinance, 1984  with the name and style of M/s Saif Textile Mills Ltd,  
powered on natural gas supplied by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited 
(SNGPL ) through Meter No.74058 , initially installed at the premises  on 
27.11.2009 . The gas company noted a substantial shortfall in the 
readings recorded by the meter and replaced it with a new one on 
24.01.2010 . Loss to the exchequer was es timated as Rs.11.68 million. It 
is in this backdrop that the respondent arraying , amon gst others 
Federation of Pakistan along with Gas & Regulatory Authority, SNGPL 
and Executive Engineer, SNGPL  filed W.P. No.3433 of 2011  in the 
Peshawar High Court , seeking multiple declarations and prayers; the 
High Court, however, vide order dated 20.12.2 011 transmitted the writ 
petition to the District & Sessions Judge /Tribunal Protection Consumer 
Interest Peshawar to  redress respondent’s grievance; it also restrained 
the department from disconnecting the gas connection.  The Sessions 
Judge transferred the  complaint to the Consumer Court constituted 
under the  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Consumer Protection Act, 1997  
(Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Act No.VI of 1997 ), “the Act ”. The complaint was 
dismissed vide order dated 08.04.2015 , however, the High Court , vide 
order dated 3. 7.2015,  once again remanded it for decision afresh with 
results no different than earlier  vide order dated 21.04.2016 , impugned Crimi nal Petition No. 47-P/2011  
 2
by the respondent before the High Court . The High Court vide 
impugned judgment dated 8.9.2017 accepted the appeal in the followi ng 
terms: - 
“For the reasons discussed above, I while 
accepting this appeal, set aside the judgment of 
the learned Consumer Court dated 21.04.2016 
and allowed the complaint”  
 
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that there was 
no occasion for the  High Court , in the first place,  to transmit the 
Constitution petition involving factual controversies  requiring technical 
verification  for determination to the Consumer Court  and, thus, on each 
occasion the Consumer Court rightly dismissed the complaint . It is next 
argued that the Act is a Statute devised to protect legitimate rights of a 
consumer to have best value for his money and for that places specified 
obligations upon the manufacturer as is evident from its preamble ; the 
respondent is not a consume r nor the petitioner a manufacturer within 
the contemplation of section  2(c) and  2(j) of the Act  and, thus, the High 
Court had misdirected itself to refer the issue to the Court , an error 
rectified through successive dismissals leaving no space for the Hig h 
Court to allow the complaint  by putting at peril a colossal amount due 
to the public exchequer, concluded the learned counsel.  
3.  Contentions raised need consideration; leave, inter alia , is 
granted to the petitioner . Mr. Shahid Qayyum Khattak, ASC  has 
entered appearance to defend the impugned order . Office is directed to 
prepare the paper book with parties , at liberty to place the additional 
documents, if any. Since, a short matter involving public exchequer is 
involved, the office shall cause fixation  of the appeal with all convenient 
dispatch.   
  Cr.M.A. No.61 -P/2017  
4.  Operation of the impugned judgment shall be held in 
abeyance.
