ORDER  
 
1. Mr. Saad Mumtaz Hashmi, learned ASC for the appellant in Intra Court 
Appeal No. 02/2023 , at the outset states that this Court, comprising of the 
Full Court, had sustained the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 
2023 (‘ the Act ’), enacted on 21 April 2023, and held it to be in accordance 
with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (‘ the Constitution ’). 
The Act  provide s a mechanism for the constitution of benches in its section 2, 
which may be considered to be a procedural matter, however, it s section 4 
stipulate s that, ‘ where interpretation of the constitutional provisions is involved ’ 
a bench of this Court comprising of not less than five judges must hear the 
case. However, learned counsel submits, that a three -member Bench of this Intra Court Appeal No. 2/2023 etc.  
 
 2
Court vide judgment dated 15 September 2023 decided the Constitution 
Petition No. 21/2022, wherein the a mendments made to the National 
Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999 (‘ NAB Ordinance ’) were challenged, 
and the majority held that most provisions thereof were unconstitutional, 
which only a bench of not less than five judges of this Court could have done.  
The contention of the learned Mr. Saad Hashmi is supported by the learned 
Attorney -General for Pakistan and learned senio r counsel Mr. Farooq H. Naek.  
 
2. Mr. Naek states that he too has assailed the majority judgment in  Intra 
Court Appeal No. 03/2023 on  behalf of a private person who was an accused . 
He states that as a matter of ab undant caution he has also filed an application 
for impleadment , if objection to the non -maintainability of the appeal was 
taken, which he apprehended since the appellant in Co nstitution Petition No. 
21/2022.  However, he does not now press the application seeking 
impleadment, since the appeal was numbered/registered, without objection . 
Therefore, the said application is  dismissed as not pressed. He further states 
that on behalf of Basharat Mirza and Abdul Jabbar he has filed separate 
review petitions,  but the same have not been numbered as yet, which he also 
does not press . Therefore , the said review petitions to be treated as withdrawn.  
 
3. Amendments to the NAB Ordinance were made, as under:  
 
(1) National Accountability Bureau (Amendment) Act, 2022 enacted 
on 22 June 2022;  
(2) National Accountability Bureau (2nd Amendment) Act, 2022, 
enacted on 12 August 2022; and  
(3) National Accountability Bureau (Amendment) Act, 2023, enacte d 
on 29 May 2023.  
  
 Hereinafter respectively referred to as ‘ 1st Amendment ’, ‘2nd 
Amendment ’ and ‘ 3rd Amendment ’ and collectively as ‘ the Amendments ’.    
 
4. It is submitted that though the 3rd Amendment was in the field when the 
said Constitution Petition No. 21/2022 was being heard ; six hearing s took 
place after its promulgation , yet the impugned judgment d id not attend to it, 
and that even if the impugned judgment is sustained the question of how trials 
will proceed when proceedings before other (non Accountability) Courts had 
taken place, and  reference is also made to sections 231 and 350 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 and section 35 of the NAB Ordinance , and it is 
stated that the 3rd Amendment had attended to matters as men tioned in the se Intra Court Appeal No. 2/2023 etc.  
 
 3
provisions, but the impugned judgment does not address the 3rd Amendment , 
which has created an anomalous situation.  
 
5. Criminal Misc. Applications No. 9264 and 9266 of 2023 : Notice. Till 
the next date of hearing the Accountability courts may proceed with trials 
but shall not announce final judgment.  
 
6. On 11 October 2023 this Court had announced the order in 
Constitution Petition No. 6/2023 etc., however, detailed reasons have not been 
given as yet. Therefore, it would be appropriate to fix these appeals after the 
release of the detailed reasons in the said cases. However, to save time let 
notice s be issued to the respondents. Since the interpretation of the 
Constitution, Federal laws and as trials which the Amendments had referred to 
courts in the provinces and to the ordinary courts in the Islamabad Capital 
Territory , which has been reversed by the impugned judgment, notices to the 
Attorney -General for Pakistan and the Advocate -Generals of a ll the provinces 
and the Islamabad Capital Territory be also issued under Order XXVII -A of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Copy of the order passed to accompany the 
notices. The incarcerated respondent  be served through the concerned Jail 
Superintendent  and be provided copies of the appeals, and if he wants to be
