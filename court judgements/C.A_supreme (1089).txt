JUDGMENT  
  Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The petitioner seek s leave 
to appeal against order  dated 0 5.03.2018 of the High Court whereby 
the notices1 issued to the respondent taxpayer  in the years 2017 
regarding tax year s 2007 and 2009 , seeking  statements   under 
section 165 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“Ordinance”) , 
reconciliation statements  under Rule 44(4) of the Income Tax Rules, 
2002 (“Rules”)  and recovery under Section 161(1A) of the 
Ordinance  were set aside on the ground that a taxpayer cannot be 
asked to furnish record beyond the period of six years after the end 
of the tax year to whi ch it relate s,  as provided under Section 174(3) 
of the Ordinance.  
2.  The respondent challenged the said notices through a 
constitutional petition before the Lahore High Court.  Relying on its 
earlier decision in  Maple Leaf2 , the High Court allowed the petition 
and set aside  the notices. The principle settled in Maple Leaf  is that 
                                                             
1 under Section s 161 (1A), 165 and Rule 44(4) of the Ordinance and the Rules, respectively.  
2 Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd v. Federal Board of Revenue, 2016 PTD 2074.  To the best 
information of the office of this Court, this decision has not been challenged before the Supreme 
Court.  C.P No.1691 -L/2018  2 
 
as the  taxpayer is under no obligation to maintain records after a 
period of six years under Section 174(3) of the Ordinance , therefore,  
any notice requiring a taxpayer to furnish records beyond the 
statutory period of six years is not lawful and no penal action coul d 
be taken against the taxpayer under such a notice.  
3.  We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner  at 
length and p erused the record . The respondent taxpayer was under 
an obligation to deduct tax from an amount to be paid to a recipient  
at the time and in the manner specified in  section 158 of the 
Ordinance . Section 165 read with Rule 44 (4) of the Rules requires a 
taxpayer , who deduct s tax as aforesaid , to furnish a  Statement  / 
Reconciliation Statement giving detai ls of the amount of tax 
deducted  and collected from a recipient. The said Statement and 
Reconciliation Statement has to be prepared on the basis of the tax 
record s maintained by the taxpayer  under the law .3  A taxpayer, 
under the law, is to retain tax records  under section 174(3) of the 
Ordinance  read with Rule 29(4)  of the Rules  for a period of six years 
after the end of the tax year to which they relate.     
4.  Section 174(1) binds a taxpayer to maintain such 
accounts, documents and records as may be prescribed . Rule 29 (1) 
of the Rules provides a list of such records.  Subsection (3) of 
section 174 makes the duty of the taxpayer to maintain the records 
for a period of six  years.  Rule 29(4) reiterates the same timeline. 
Time based obligation of maintaining records contemplated under 
the Ordinance and the Rules is a legislative mandate that pro motes  
efficient and smart fiscal administration and governance.  It is 
underlined that the Ordinance is largely structured around time -
framed provisions in order to make the taxing mechanism certain 
and transparent and the tax administration and tax governance 
smarter and efficient. Reference, with advantage, can be 
conveniently made to sections 120 (assessment), 122 (amendment 
of assessment) and 221 (rectification of mistakes) of the 
Ordinance in this regard.    
5.  Reading of the  Ordinance and the Rules envisage s that 
any proceedings against a taxpayer that is based o n the tax records 
maintained by the taxpayer sh ould be initiated within a fixed 
                                                             
3 See section 174(1) of the Act read with Rule 29 of the Rules.  C.P No.1691 -L/2018  3 
 
timeframe . Section 174 creates an obligation on the taxpayer  to 
maintain such accounts, documents and records as prescribed for a 
period of six years , except in case of pending proceedings, where the 
obligation of a taxpayer to maintain the record is till the final 
decision of the proceedings  (exception is not attracted in the present 
case) , while the same provision protect s the taxpayer from being 
asked  to produce the record beyond the said period . As notices 
under Sections 161, 165 and Rule 44(4) can only be re plied to on 
the basis of the record maintained by the taxpayer, joint reading of 
Sections 161, 165 and Rule 44(4) and Section 174(3) and Rule 29 
establishes that the tax department is under an obligation to be 
vigilant and efficient enough so as to proceed against a taxpayer 
within th e statutory timeframe  provided under section 174(3) . Even 
though there is no specific limitation for issuance of notices under 
section 161( 1A) or 165(2B) or Rule 44(4)  but these provisions 
cannot be actualized or given effect to  unless the record , available 
with the taxpayer , is examined and verified by the tax authorities. 
Since the aforesaid provisions of law require taxpayer to maintain 
record for a period of six years, hence notices b eyond a period of 
six year s cannot be given effect to . As the taxpayer is under no 
legal oblig ation to maintain tax records after the said statutory 
period, any such notices demanding the taxpayer to furnish such 
information are inconsistent with the clear provision s of the 
Ordinance and hence unlawful. Harmonized reading of the statute 
require s that Section 174(3) and Section s 161, 165 and Rule 44(4)  
must complement each other so as to promote the purposes of the 
Ordinance and equally protect and safeguard the right s of both 
the tax manager and the taxpayer as envisaged under the 
Ordinance . Therefore,  even though notices under Section 161 (1A), 
165(2B) and Rule 44(4)  have no prescribed period of limitation , 
the statutory timeframe kicks in the minute the time period under 
Section 174(3) is exhausted rendering  such  notices ineffective and 
unenforce able, attracting no penal consequences  for the taxpayer.  
It is clarified that the department is only restricted where it seeks 
record beyond the statutory period under Section 174(3) from the 
taxpayer but is otherwise free to proceed if the action or 
proceedings under the Ordinance  are based on the record already 
in possession of the department.  C.P No.1691 -L/2018  4 
 
6.   We, therefore, endorse the view expressed in  Maple 
Leaf4 by the Lahore High Court , where a similar question had come 
up before the court. We have also examined Habib Bank5 which 
holds that the department can override the timeframe under Section 
174(3) by justifying the delay in initiating the matter against the 
taxpayer . Section 174(3) of the Ordinance read with Rule 29(4) of 
the Rules is clear and leave s no room for any such departmental 
justification, which in any case cannot deprive the taxpayer of the 
statutory protection under section 174(3) of the Ordinance. We, 
therefore, do not support the view  expressed in Habib Bank  as we 
have not be en able to find any statutory support for the conclusion 
arrived at in the said  case.  
7.  It is also useful to draw attention to Section 214A of the 
Ordinance which specifically deals with “condonation of time limit ”. 
Perusal of the said provision shows that it applies where there is a 
time limit provided in the provision, which is not so in the  case of 
Sections 161 and 165 of the Ordinance. Further Section 214A deals  
with “any act or thing to be done” within a timeframe. Section 174(3) 
on the other hand does not require any act or thing to be done in a 
particular timeframe but quite on the contrary provides that after a 
lapse of a period of six years, the taxpayer sha ll not be obligated to 
maintain its tax records. Therefore, Section 214A has no application 
to the present case and cannot be invoked to deprive the taxpayer of 
the statutory protection under section 174(3) of the Ordinance.    
8.   For the above reasons  we hold that a taxpayer is 
obliged to maintain the record  under section 174(3)  of the  
Ordinance for a period of six years and the taxpayer cannot be 
compelled to produce the record for a tax year beyond the period 
of six years as stipulated in section 174 (3) of the Ordinance.  
Hence notices issued under section 165 (2B) or 161(1A) of the 
Ordinance being ineffective and unenforceable are set aside.

5 Habib Bank Limited v Federation of Pakistan  2013 PTD 1659. The FBR challenged this 
judgement before this Court in Civil Appeals Nos. 1318 to 1339/2013 but the case was disposed of 
vide order dated 10.03.2020 on the understanding that the FBR shall give fresh reasons for initiatin g 
the process beyond  the statutory period. The legal view expressed in Maple Leaf  and the question 
before us was not addressed by this Court.  C.P No.1691 -L/2018  5 
 
9.  For the foregoing reasons, we take no exception to the  
impugned order . Leave is, therefore, declined and this  petition is  
dismissed.
