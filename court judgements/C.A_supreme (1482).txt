ORDER  
 Jawwad S. Khawaja, J. - Crl. O.P. 115 of 2014 : On 6.3.201 5 we had passed an 
order which is absolutely cle ar and without any ambiguity. The main thrust and purport of 
the order is that our order of 25.10.2013 shall not be allowed to be violated. We reproduce 
the relevant part of our order dated 25.10.2013 :- 
“5.   Thus, Chairman CDA, Chairman NHA and any other executing agency are 
hereby restrained not to undertake any exercise towards the construction of 
Tunnel in the Margallah Hills enroute to the Province of KPK, nor CDA shall 
grant licence of crushing stones from the Margallah Hills. The Chairman CDA is 
further directed to constitute a team which shall put up a report that no activity of 
constructing of Tunnel or crushing of stones or encroachment or any other 
activity in the National Park is going on. If there is any such activity, the same 
shall be stopped at once. Copy of the compliance report shall be submitted before  2  
this Court through Registrar for our perusal in Chambers and passing further 
orders if need be.”   
 When the case was listed for hearing yesterday i.e. 18.03.2015 a letter dated 17.3.2015 was  
placed before us which has been issued by Bashir Ahmed, Director (Industries & Labour),  
Govt. of Pakistan . The said Bashir Ahmed is present in Court today and he was specifically 
summoned because para 2 of the aforesaid letter is in the following terms: - 
“2. In pursuance of the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s orders dated 16th 
March, 2015, in CRPs No.315,316 of 2013 in CMAs -6158 -6159 of 2013 in 
SMC -20 of 2007 AND Crl.O.P.No.115 of 2014, Mining Lease of M/s FECTO 
Cement Limited issued vide letter No.DDI&MD/ICT/ LL-5/Vol -1/2467, dated 
21.12.2011 is hereby cancelled with immediate effect. You are directed to stop 
all activities and remove all installation forthwith.”  
Today, Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, learned counsel has come to the Court on behalf of respondent 
No.6. He has  argued that respondent No.6 i.e. M/s Fecto Cement Pvt. Ltd has not been 
undertaking any activities which are violative either of our order dated 25.10.2013 
reproduced above or the Section 21 of the Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, 
Conservatio n and Management) Ordinance 1979. We may point out that the moment we 
saw the letter on 17.3.2015 referred to above, we immediately summon ed the Director 
(Industries & Labour) Govt. of Pakistan because our order of 16.3.2015 is clear and does not 
show  any ambiguity. We, therefore, expressed our surprise that the said Bashir Ahmed has 
stated in his letter that it was in pursuance of the Supreme Court ’s order dated 25.10.2013 
and on that basis he had proceeded to cancel the mining lease issued to M/s Facto Ce ment 
Ltd. (respondent No.6).  
3. We may make it abundantly clear that no violation of our order shall be 
countenanced. If indeed respondent No.6 is undertaking any quarrying activity within the 
area of the Margallah Hills National Park, it would be a viola tion of  our orders because we 
have specifically stopped  illegal activities , quarrying etc.  within the area of the Margallah 
Hills National Park which activities are violative of our order  dated 25.10.2013 and Section 
21(4) of the Islamabad Wildlife (Prote ction, Preservation, Conservation and Management) 
Ordinance 1979.  Needless to add, all violators of our orders shall be proceeded against.  
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners Israr Ahmed and two others was asked to file a 
concise statement because it wa s his plea that the Director (Industries & Labour) had  3  
violated our orders of 25.10.2013 and this had been done earlier also. Today , he has the 
concise statement  with him . Let the same be filed in Court. Copy of the same shall be 
provided to each of the pa rties.  
5. The matter to come up on 8.4.2015.
