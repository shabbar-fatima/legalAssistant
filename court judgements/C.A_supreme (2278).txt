     ORDER  
 
       Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Surprised  at 12:30 p.m. on 
23.1.2020  by a contingent of Police Station Kotwali Sialkot, Muhammad 
Noman Munir, petitioner herein, was found in possession of cannabis  
weighed as 1380 grams with a lethal combination of 07 grams of heroin ; 
courts below declined his request for admission to bail.  
 Submissions at the bar range from absence of a witness from the 
public to a quantity bordering slightly beyond the  volume covered by 
section 9 (c) of the Control of Narcotic Substa nces Act, 1997 .  
2.  Heard.  
3.  1380 grams of cannabis with 07 grams of heroin squarely fall 
within the mischief of the section ibid that attracts prohibition embodied in 
section 51 of the Act ibid and as such the argument being presumptuous 
is beside the mark. Insofar as non -association of a witness from the public 
is concerned , people collected at the scene, despite request abstained to 
assist the law and it is so mentioned in the crime report  itself, a usual 
conduct symptomatic of societal apa thy towards civic responsibilities . Criminal Petition No.610 of 2020  
  
 2
Even otherwise, the members of the contingent being functionaries of the 
State are second to none in their status, with their acts  statutor ily 
presumed , prima facie , as intra vires. Refusal by the Courts below being 
well within the remit of law  calls for no interference. Petition fails. Leave 
declined.
