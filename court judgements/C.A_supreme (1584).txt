Pakistan  (“State Bank ”) presented to the Court  a statement

“State Bank of Pakistan

17 Account XXIV (Pension Payment Account 
- PPOD)  0.00 
Total  1,409,960461,897.46  
 
  The Acting Governor explained that these amounts 
constituted the Federal Consolidated Fund  (“Fund ”). The 
amount lying in A ccount No.I (Non-Food)  (“Account I ”) 
constitutes by far the largest component of the Fund (being 
98.77% thereof as of the date for which the data was 
provided). It was further explained that  the amount lying in 
Account I is not des ignated for any particula r or special usage 
whatsoever.  Furthermore, the funds therein are not static C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     3 
 
   inasmuch as there are regular (it seems almost daily) inflows 
into, and outflows therefrom, as Government receipts flow in, 
and monies are released to mee t Government expenditures . 
The Acting Governor stated that other than Account I, the 
other  16 accounts were for special and designated purposes, 
carrying different amounts as set out in the table above.  
 
2.   It was explained to the Acting Governor that a s per 
para 5 of the order  dated 04.04.2023 made in Constitution 
Petition No.5 of 2023  (“Order ”), a sum of Rs.21 Billion was 
required for the purposes of general elections to the Punjab 
and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assemblies and  it was queried  as 
to whether this  sum could be made availa ble from the funds 
aforementioned of the Federal Government lying with and 
under the custody , control and management  of the State 
Bank , with particular reference to Account I . The Acting 
Governor confirmed that this would be done i f the Court so 
directed and ordered. The State Bank further confirmed that 
the necessary transaction for the transfer  of funds to the 
Commission , so that Rs.21 Billion become immediately 
available and utilizable for the latter , could be done within the 
shortest possible  time,  and at the latest by the close of 
business on Monday i.e. 17.04.2023.  
 
3.  The team from the Ministry of Finance /Finance 
Division (“ Finance ”) was led by the Special Secretary, 
Mr.Awais Manzur Sumra . The Secretary, with the assistance 
of the learned Attorney G eneral, also gave a presentation to C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     4 
 
   the Court, in broad terms , with regard to the financial 
position of the Government of Pakistan , with particular 
reference also to the present and/ or pending international 
obligations to the IMF . From the figures presente d to the 
Court, of which even the smallest r an to several hundreds of 
Billions of Rupees, it became clear that the disbursement of 
Rs.21 Billion for fulfilling the constitutional mandate of 
holding the general elections would , at mo st, amount to a 
minuscul e increase in the obligations of the Federal 
Government . Indeed, viewed from certain financial 
perspectives and context s, which were stated by the team 
from Finance,  the amount  would be so insignificant as to not 
even amount to a ro unding of f error . The te am from Finance 
also informed the Court that the Federal Government 
regularly went into the bond  market s to borrow and rais e 
funds which in the aggregate in any  given fin ancial year ran 
into trillions of Rupees. It was stated that i n this regard 
Treasury bills were issued by the Stat e Bank on behalf of the 
Federal Government on a regular and ongoing basis and that, 
even in this per spective , taking the amount now under 
consideration into account would not have any meaningful 
impact  or effect . It was also confirmed by Finance that if th e 
Court so ordered and directed the process of making the 
funds to the tune of Rs.  21 Billion available to the 
Commission on an immediately utilizable basis would be 
concluded rapidly , and by the close of  business on 
17.04.2023.  C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     5 
 
    
4.  In our view, on an as sessment of the presentations 
made by the State Bank and the Finance Ministry/Division , 
there can be no doubt that the Rs.21 Billion required by the 
Commission and ordered to be made available  in terms of  
para 5 of the O rder can be done immediately and wit hin a 
matter of a day. As to the exact mechanism for the transfer, 
the team from the Commission, ably led by the Secretary Mr.  
Omar Hamid Khan explained that the funds made available to 
and utilized by th e Commission lay with AGPR. That agency 
had allocate d an ID number (bearing No.2826 ) for the funds 
available to the Commission. T o this ID number there is 
associa ted a ceiling determined by the Finance Division and 
within that ceiling the funds allocated t o the aforesaid ID 
number are readily and immediatel y available to and 
utilizable by the Commission. Of course, as expected and 
confirmed by the Election Commission, any utilization of any 
funds whatsoever would be for the specific and proper ly 
assigned pu rpose (here the holding of general elections to the 
Punjab and KP Assemblies)  and always in terms of the 
applicable accounting rules and procedure , and  ultimately 
subject  also to proper audit. It was further confirmed to the 
Court  by all the officials and teams  that on its order, the State 
Bank would send a n appropriate  communication to the 
Finance Division to the effect that Rs.21 Billion from Account 
I stood allocated to the Commission for purposes of the 
general elections as aforesaid and that the Financ e Division 
would then immediately send a n appropriat e communication C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     6 
 
   (on the same day) to the AGPR directing it to raise the ceiling 
of the limit associated with ID No.2826 by Rs.  21 Billion . In 
this way the Election Commission would immediately have 
access  to, and be able to utilize,  the said funds  for purp oses 
of the general elections .  
 
5.  With the assistance of the learned Attorney 
General and the team from the Finance , the Court also 
examined the relevant provisions of the Constitution relating 
to the allocation of these funds. It was confirmed by the 
officials of the Finance Ministry that in terms of Article 84 of 
the Constitution, the Federal Government was fully 
authorized to make expenditures from the Federal 
Consolidated Fund for, inter alia,  “expenditure upon some 
new service not included in the An nual Budget Statement”  for 
the relevant  financial  year here  being the year ending on 
30.06.2023. For s uch expenditure  the Federal Government 
obtains ex post facto  approval and authorization from the 
Natio nal Assembly in terms of the procedure laid down in the 
Articles of the Constitution immediately preceding Article 84.  
On a consideration of all of the foregoing it  is our view that 
there is absolutely no difficulty or hitch , either financially or 
procedur ally or in terms of the relevant authorization by an d 
under the Constitution , for the immediate release of Rs.21 
Billion to the Election Commission for fulfilling its 
constitutional mandate for the holding of general elections to 
the Punjab and KP Assembli es.  
 C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     7 
 
   6.  In view of the foregoing, it is hereby ord ered and

Assemblies. The State Bank shall in this

   and become available to and with the 
Election Commission in immediately 
releasable and utilizable fund s for the 
purposes of holding the general elections to 
the Punjab an d KP Assemblies. All the 
entities mentioned above i .e. the State Bank,

direction of the Court is implemented within 
the stipulated time frame.  
ii) The State Bank and the Finance Ministry/

Division shall also include a confir mation in 
relation to AGPR. Likewise, the Election 
Commission shall on 18.04.2023 file a report 
with this Court confirming that Rs.21 Billion 
have become available to it in terms as

all purposes  for the authorization of 
expenditure on the Federal Consolidated 
Fund and the Federal Government shall 
thereupon obtain the ex post facto  approval C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 202 3 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                     9 
 
   and sanction from the National Assembly  for
