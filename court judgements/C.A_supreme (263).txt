  JUDGMENT  
 
 
 
Munib Akhtar , J.: At the conclusion of the hearing, the following 
short order was made:  CA 489, 490/2013 & 1 302/2014  -:2:-
“For the reasons to be recorded later, Civil Appeals No. 489 -
490/2013 are allowed whereas Civil Appeal No. 1302/2014 
is adjourned.”  
2. The matters arise out of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 
(“Ordinance”) and the point in issue is the applicability or 
otherwise of clause (9) of Part IV of the Second Schedule to that 
Ordinance (“Clause 9”). The Appellate Tribunal had decided against 
the assessee (on the latter’s appeals) but, on a tax reference filed in 
the High Court, the decision was reversed by means of the 
impugned judgment. The department sought leave to appeal, 
which was granted vide order dated  15.04.2013. The assessment 
years involved are 1994 -95 and 1995 -96.  
3. Clause 9 was added to the Ordinance in 1991. As originally 
inserted it was in the following terms  (emphasis supplied) : 
 
“(9) The provisions of section 80C i n so far as they relate to 
payments on account of the supply of goods on which tax is 
deductible under sub -section (4) of section 50 shall not apply 
in respect of any person, being a manufacturer of such 
goods, who opts out of  the presumptive tax regime:  
 
Provided that a declaration of final and irrevocable option is 
furnished in writing alongwith the return of total income 
under section 55:  
 
Provided further that nothing contained in this clause shall 
apply to any manufacturer of goods for which special r ates of 
deduction of tax are specified under clause (c) of  sub-section 
(4) of section 50.”  
 Section 80C, also added in 1991, applied in terms as stated 
therein  a tax regime known as the “presumptive tax regime” (PTR). 
This was in contradistinction to the “ normal tax regime”, that 
otherwise applied in relation to the assessment of income. By the 
Finance Act, 1996, the main paragraph of Clause 9 was amended 
so that it read as follows (emphasis supplied):  
“(9) The provisions of section 80C in so far as they re late to 
payments on account of the supply of goods on which tax is 
deductible under sub -section (4) of section 50 shall not apply 
in respect of any person, being a manufacturer of such 
goods, unless he opts for  the presumptive tax regime: …” 
 Thus, for the words “who opts out of”, the words “unless he 
opts for” were substituted.  CA 489, 490/2013 & 1 302/2014  -:3:-
4. In the tax references filed by the respondent -assessee in the 
High Court, as many as nine questions of law were raised. 
However, the crucial question was No. VII, and leave was grant ed 
in this Court only to consider whether the said question (which 
was answered in the affirmative) was correctly dealt with by the 
High Court. The said question was as follows:  
“That without prejudice to the all other questions whether 
the amendment broug ht in Clause -9 part IV to the Second 
Schedule by way of replacing the phrase “who opts out of” by 
the phrase “unless he opts for” is not correcting the mischief 
in clearing the ambiguity existing to save the assessment 
who maintains proper account.”  
In eff ect, the learned High Court treated this question as 
being whether or not the amendment made to Clause 9 by the 
Finance Act, 1996 would have retrospective effect in the facts and 
circumstances of the case. The question was answered in the 
affirmative, in f avor of the assessee and against the department.  
5. In the Appellate Tribunal, the facts as found by that forum 
were that the assessee -appellant was issued with notices under s. 
66A on or about 05.10.1998 in relation to the assessment years 
involved, 1994 -95 and 1995 -96, on the ground that it had never 
given the option in writing as required by the first proviso to 
Clause 9. The response initially given by the assessee, as presently 
relevant, was that it had never given the option in writing. 
However, be fore t he Tribunal the assessee  changed course and  
produced a letter dated 29.12.1994 that it had purportedly written 
to the concerned tax officer, which stated that the assessee was 
exercising the option as per the first proviso. This letter was 
disregarded by t he Tribunal as being an “afterthought” and 
inconsistent with the stance earlier taken. It was noted, inter alia, 
that “the original is not available on the departmental record” and 
that “it was not filed with the returns”.  
6. In the High Court, the assessee a rgued that the amendment 
made to Clause 9 by the Finance Act, 1996 was declaratory or 
remedial in nature and therefore had retrospective effect. After 
considering what was meant, in law, by a declaratory or remedial 
statute or amendment, the learned High C ourt concluded that it 
was not “ strictly  remedial in nature” (emphasis in original). CA 489, 490/2013 & 1 302/2014  -:4:-
However, the learned Court then went on to hold that “the 
amendment in Clause 9 is simply a change in the mode of 
assessment, thus procedural in nature”. It was also held as follows 
(emphasis in original):  
“What the amendment has actually done is to change the 
mode, which is procedural . No substantive right of the 
appellant has been affected, no new tax has been imposed 
and only the mode of assessment has been altered.  
The procedural law, if altered and that too for the 
benefit of the assessee then in such a case, the amendment 
would be retrospective and applicable to cases, which are 
pending before a forum prescribed by law. ” 
 On the foregoing basis it was concluded that th e amendment 
had retrospective effect and, as noted, question No. VII was 
answered in favor of the assessee.  
7. Before us, learned counsel for the appellant -department 
submitted that the assessee kept changing its stance, as found by 
the Tribunal , and the “fin al” position that it sought to take before 
that forum, namely that the option had been exercised, was 
rejected. That, it was submitted, was a finding of fact, which could 
not be challenged further and, indeed, was not disturbed by the 
learned High Court. I t was also submitted that the learned High 
Court had erred materially in concluding that Clause 9 was merely 
procedural in nature. It was a substantive provision,  and the 
applicability (or otherwise) of the clause materially altered the 
“regime” under whic h an assessee was to be treated, i.e., PTR or 
NTR. It could not therefore have retrospective effect. It was 
submitted that the Tribunal had correctly dealt with the matter, 
and its decision ought to be restored.  Learned counsel for the 
respondent -assessee submitted that the decision impugned was 
correct and that the appeal ought to be dismissed.  
8. After having heard learned counsel and considered the 
relevant provisions and the record, we concluded that the appeals 
ought to be allowed.  The principal question was whether the 
amendment made to Clause 9 in 1996 was procedural in nature 
and hence retrospective, as held by the learned High Court.  Part IV 
of the Second Schedule to the Ordinance, as st ated in s. 14(1)(d), 
contained “exemptions from the operation of a ny provision of this 
Ordinance, subject to the conditions and to the extent specified CA 489, 490/2013 & 1 302/2014  -:5:-
therein”. Now, for present purposes, the provisions of the 
Ordinance could be regarded as having been either substantive or 
procedural.  A clause in Part IV could therefor e be regarded as 
being substantive or procedural depending on the particular 
provision of the Ordinance that it gave exemption from.  The first 
question to consider therefore was whether s. 80C was a 
substantive provision or procedural in nature.  
9. Now, s. 80C was added by the Finance Act, 1991 and Clause 
9 was inserted a few months later by the Federal Government 
through SRO 829(I)/1991 dated 24.08.1991, in exercise of powers 
conferred by s. 14(2).  Section 80C deemed certain payments, as 
specified therein, as  received by certain classes of persons  (also as 
specified ) to be the income accruing to the latter and taxed them at 
specified rates. For the payments that were within the ambit of the 
section, the gross receipts (i.e., the payments themselves) became 
income. Th us, th e very thing that was the subject matter of the 
Ordinance and sought to be taxed in terms thereof, was being 
directly affected and altered.  The legal meaning of “income” was 
changed. Clearly, this was, and could only be, a substantive 
provisio n. It followed that Clause 9, which granted an exemption 
from the operation of this deeming provision, was itself substantive 
in nature , since  on the applicability or otherwise of the clause 
depended whether the gross receipts in question were to be 
deemed  to be income.  
10. As originally inserted, Clause 9 gave the choice of opting out 
of s. 80C if the option, as given in terms of the first proviso, was 
properly exercised. Thus, s. 80C applied unless the “opt -out” was 
triggered.  In other words, the legal meanin g of income stood altered 
in respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C unless the 
assessee concerned took step s to the contrary.  The amendment 
made by the Finance Act, 1996 reversed this position. It now 
provided that it was only if the option giv en in terms of the proviso 
was exercised that s. 80C applied.  In other words, the assessee 
had to “opt -in” into the PTR.  If the option was not exercised, the 
legal meaning of income, even in respect of the payments within 
the ambit of s. 80C, was not altered. Once this becomes clear it is 
difficult, with respect, to  see how, as held by the learned High 
Court, the amendment could be regarded as procedural, having CA 489, 490/2013 & 1 302/2014  -:6:-
retrospective effect. Prior to the amendment, the legal meaning of 
income stood altered to the e xtent of s. 80C unless the assessee 
did something. After the amendment, the legal meaning of income 
did not stand altered unless the assessee did something. Th e two 
resultant situations were starkly different. Each had a substantive 
effect that was diametr ically opposed to the other. With respect 
therefore, the learned High Court erred materially in its answer to 
question No.VII. It ought to have been answered in favor of the 
department and against the respondent. We so held.  
11. Once the conclusion was as just  arrived at, the result was 
that the impugned judgment was not sustainable. The point taken 
by learned counsel for the respondent, that the option had been 
exercised, was, with respect, not sustainable as it was contrary to 
the finding of fact given by the  Tribunal. That finding was not 
disturbed by the learned High Court. The appeals had therefore to 
be allowed, and this was announced at the conclusion of the 
hearing.  
12. The foregoing are the reasons for our short order.
