Hamid, learned counsel for the Government of Balochistan has 
submitted a Progress Report  (CMA No.5296 of 2012) , purporting to  
indic ate an improvement in the l aw and order situation in the P rovince 
of Ba lochistan . The Petitioner /President, Balochistan High Court Bar 
Association  and the other counsel s have contradicted the stand and 
pointed out that since 5th December, 2012 , instead of any improvement 
in protect ing the lives and properties of the citizens, the situation has 
badly deteriorated. It would be appropriate to reproduce herein below 
the R eport , submitted by Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned counsel for the 
Government of Balochistan: - 
“In compliance of this Hon’ble Court order dated 05.12.2012, the 
Home Secretary Government of Balochistan submits as under:

kidnapping could be avoided.  
 
 Const.P.77/2010  5 
 IMPROVEMENT OF LAW AND ORDER SITUATION IN 
MEKRAN DIVIS ION AND KHUZDAR DISTRICT  
 
 As a result of measures taken by the provincial Government, law 
and order situation in Mekran Division in general and Khuzdar 
District in particular is improving and the confidence of the

government functionaries are performing to the best of their 
ability.  
 
 The Press Club Khuzdar which was dysfunctional since long has

r/o Quetta.

hold that FC or any State Agency would not have any

Government  of Balochistan.  
 
3. STEPS TAKEN BY THE PROVINCIAL 
GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE LAW AND

improve law and order situation in the Province:  
 
a. A meeting under the Chairmanship of Chief  Minister

order situation in the Province. Minutes of meetings are 
enclosed as (ANN -A) 
 
b. It is decided to establish a dedicated force for the arrest of 
sectarian violence and kidnapping for ransom incidents in 
Quetta District. In this regard the Inspector General of 
Police was given the task to establish the force and 
provide necessary human resource and logistics.  
 
c. A special session of the Provincial Assembly is summoned 
on 19th December 2012 to  discuss Law and Order Const.P.77/2010  7 
situation in the Province and suggest measures to improve 
the situation.  
 
d. In pursuance of decision of Government of Balochistan 
regarding constitution of Divisional Law and Order 
Committees, the Divisional Commissioners hold s week ly 
meeting to review the law and order situation at divisional 
level. Minutes of meetings are enclosed as (ANN -B) 
 
4. PROGRESS OF INVESTIGATION IN CASES i.e. 
MISSING PERSONS, TARGET KILLINGS, 
SECTARIAN KILLINGS AND KIDNAPPING FOR 
RANSOM  
 
 In compliance of order dated 12.10.2012, so far 427 cases of 
missing persons, mutilated dead bodies, kidnapping for ransom 
and target killing have been shifted to Criminal Investigation 
Department. The Criminal Investigation Department is actively 
investigating these cases . The up to date progress report of 
investigation of each case prepared by DIG, CID has already 
been filed before this Hon’ble Court.  
 
5. REHABILITATION OF IDPs OF DERA BUGTI  
 
 In response to advertisement published in news papers for filing 
of claims, the  District Administration has received 18205 claims. 
After receipt of claims, the verification process of claims is under 
way. Earlier Committees had cleared six thousand claims for 
financial assistance. The process of verification has been started 
with Teh sil Dera Bugti where the verification is being done at 
Mouza level. The process of verifications of claims is taking time 
due to disturbed law and order situation and various nature of 
claims submitted by the applicants and huge sum of money which 
needs to  be disbursed as per rules and policy issued by the 
Government of Balochistan.  
 
6. PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO THE VICTIMS 
OF TERRORISM  
 
 In pursuance of compliance of Interim Order dated 12.10.2012, 
the Provincial Cabinet has approved enhancement for payme nt of 
compensation to the legal heirs of victims of terrorism from 
Rupees 0.4 to 1.0 Million. The Home Department has taken up the 
case with Finance Department for release of balance of amount 
of Rupees 82 Millions for payment of compensation to the legal 
heirs of (whose mutilated dead bodies were recovered).  
 
7. CMA NO.2346 OF 2012 REGARDING ISSUANCE OF 
SIMS  
 
 The Provincial Government is of the view that if the order dated 
21.5.2012 regarding issuance of 5 SIMs per CNIC is being Const.P.77/2010  8 
implemented only for the P rovince of Balochistan; it would not 
serve the purpose to stop the illegal use of mobile phones in 
crimes. The person who intends to use mobile phones in any 
crime can purchase SIMs from other Province which can be used 
all over the country. In a recent ca se of kidnapping for ransom of 
Dr. Saeed, the Quetta Police in collaboration with Bahawalpur 
Police arrested a gang of three persons involved in activating un -
registered SIMs fraudulently by means of identity theft using the 
data of different  people obtain ed through voters list. The said 
gang used to activate 600/700 SIMs daily which were supplied in 
blackmail market through out the country for illegal use.  
 
 In view of above, the Government of Balochistan strongly opposes 
the contention of applicants and r equest that order dated 
21.05.2012 may be implemented in letter and spirit through out 
the country.  
 
Compliance report is submitted for perusal, please.

3. There is no necessity to discuss both the Reports , as comparison  
of the same is self explanatory and it can conveniently be judged as to 
whether the law and order situation has improved and as a result 
thereof  the Fundamental Rights of the citizens in terms of Article 9 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , 1973, have been 
fully secured/protected . On behalf of Government of Pakistan, a Report 
(CMA No.5307 of 2012) has also been submitted, the  contents whereof 
also reproduced herein below: -

4.  On the last date of hearing, we have pointed out , in the following 
terms , the implication of non -enforcement of  the Fundamental Rights 
under the Constitution.    
“5. We had painfully noted in the concluding para of 
order dated 20.11.2012, that a minimum performance 
should be shown before the next date of hearing by at least 
effecting recovery of missing persons wit hout any 
discrimination as to which area of the Province they 
belonged.  The learned counsel for GOB states that 
Muhammad Bux has been found not to be missing while 
the two other persons namely, Samiullah and Din 
Muhammad have not been found to be missing persons by 
the learned High Court as they, after commission of 
crimes made good their escape.  Be that as it may, in our 
opinion, such performance is not sufficient at all. The 
miseries of nears and dears ones of the missing persons, 
whose names are also a vailable on our files, are 
increasing day by day. It may not be out of context to 
observe that in some of such cases, as per version of the 
reports as well as the PPO/Inspector General of Police, 
Balochistan, the FC Personnel’s are involved. In this 
behalf , there is sufficient material available in the shape of Const.P.77/2010  13 
judicial inquiries like in the matter of Abdul Maalik and 
Bansra.  In the case of Zafar Ullah, Zakir Majeed Baloch 
and Ali Hassan Maingal FIRs have also been registered. 
In respect of Mehran Baloch a nd Muhammad Khan Marri 
cases have been registered, the DIG, CID had been asked 
to conduct investigation in the matter and it has come on 
record during the hearing of the case that no progress has 
been made. At the cost of repetition, we may observe that 
it is the constitutional responsibility of the Executive 
Government to ensure protection of the life, failing which 
all the legal consequences under the law and the 
constitution are bound to follow sooner or later but at 
present it is a matter of the commitm ent and duty under 
the Constitution. If someone believes that by consuming 
more time in locating missing persons or failing to provide 
protection to the life and property of citizens, the problem 
will go away, he/they are mistaken and are doing so at 
their  own risk and cost because as far as the law and the 
Constitution is concerned, it has its own way to proceed 
and get itself implemented in letter and spirit. ” 
 
5. In the light of our earlier Orders and the Reports , which have 
referred to hereinabove , we h ave pointed out to the lea rned couns el for 
the Government of Balochistan that it is the responsibility of the 
Executive Government to protect the lives and properties of the 
citizens , and to take decision s, keeping in view the result of non -
enforcement of the Constitutional Provisions , particularly , those for  
protecting the Fundamental Rights of the citizens in the Province of 
Balochistan. However, Mr. Akbar Durrani, Home Secretary, 
Government of Balochistan , stated that the efforts are being made to 
ensure  the protection of the lives and properties of the citizens 
throughout the Province and now everyone is free to travel on the roads 
under the protection of the security agencies . Steps are also being taken 
to provide protection to the Zaireen, who normally  travel from Quetta 
to Taftan for onward Ziarats and except a few incidents, which have Const.P.77/2010  14 
been pointed out in the Report filed today , no other major incident has 
taken place. The statement of the Home Secretary is not satisfactory, in 
view of the facts , whic h have been brought on record by the petitioner -
President, Balochistan High Court Bar Association , coupled with the 
other facts revealed.  We have to make a distinction between the crime s, 
which are being committe d on account of non -existence of the 
authori ty and crimes where the accused after committing the crime s 
make good their escape . A few have been arrested by the Levis but not 
a single person /accused  involved in the crime of the sectarian killings 
has been arrested. Similarly, as far as the persons/ victims of kidnapping  
for ransom are concerned , most of them got released after making 
payment of ransom . Reference , in this behalf , can readily be made to 
the case of Habibullah Mujahid, who according to the petitioners paid 
Rs.35 lac s and to get himself  released , which  fact has also not been 
disputed by the Provincial Authorities. After passing the order on 12th 
October, 2012, wherein , we have categorically observe d, 
“Unfortunately in the instant case Federal Government except 
deploying FC Troops, h as also failed to protect Province of 
Balochistan from internal disturbances. Similarly, as far as Provincial 
Government of Balochistan is concerned it had lost its constitutional 
authority to govern the Province because of violation of fundamental 
rights of the p eople of Pakistan” , we were expect ing that the Executive  
Government would  take steps to enforce the Constitution in its real Const.P.77/2010  15 
spirit . It seems that on one pretext or the other questions of the 
enforcement of Fundamental Rights of the citizens for providing 
protection to the li ves and properties  of the citizens  remain  un-assured 
inspite of the fact that more than two months have passed , as is evident 
from the two Reports referred to hereinabove , submitted on behalf of 
the Provincial Government as well as by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners.  
6. We have pointed out to the learned counsel for the Government 
of Balochistan that in presence of the above situation, we have to 
finally dispose of the matter either way , may be on the next date of 
hearing, there fore, he should come prepare to address us.  
7. Mr. Baz Muhammad Kakar, learned ASC stated that on the last 
date of hearing, he had  pointed out that the Doctors working in the 
Province of Balochistan ha d been suspended , as they  were  agitati ng 
against the kidnapping for ransom of one of their colle ague , Dr. Saeed 
Elahi, and even prior  to his abduction , such kidnapping has become a 
routine and more than 25 to 30 doctors ha d become victims and were 
released , after receiving ransom. A ccording to him , in view of the  
assurance given that  the matter shall be settled , the doctors voluntarily
