 Criminal Petition No. 474-L of 2024        - 2 - 
 
   2.   Being aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the 
petitioner approached the Lahore High Court, Lahore by filing a 
criminal appeal, which was dismissed ; hence this peti tion.   
3.  Facts  of the case,  in brief , are that on 16.02.2023 , the 
complainant , namely , Amanat Ali , Sub -Inspector along with 
Muhammad Asif, 2086/C a nd Sajjad Hussain , 2776/HC , while on 
patrolling duty were present at Malik Travel Sheikhupura Road . 
The co mplainant received a spy information that the petitioner who 
is a proclaimed offender of First Information Report No.1192 of 
2022 under Section 322 PPC, Police Station Sabzi Mandi 
Gujranwala might come to gape chowk for supply of narcotics and 
if raid is c onducted he can be arrested. A raid on the pointed place 
was accordingly conducted and the petitioner was apprehended 
who disclosed his name as Haider Maher , petitioner herein.  
4.   On personal search of the petitioner by the 
complainant, charas, dark brow n colour in mound form, carrying 
in a blue shopper holding in his right hand  was recovered and on 
weighing the same was found to be 2300 grams . The complainant 
separated 115 grams charas  as a representative sample. Two 
sealed parcels i.e. one as a represen tative sample and the other for 
the remaining charas, were prepared by the complainant .  
5.  On further search  of the petitioner , heroin was also 
recovered from his possession containing a small shopper and on 
weighing that was found to be 700 grams , out o f which the 
complainant separated 35 grams and prepared two sealed parcels 
thereof . Sale proceeds amounting to Rs.43,000/ - was also 
recovered from the possession of the petitioner .  Criminal Petition No. 474-L of 2024        - 3 - 
 
     After investigation, the petitioner was found guilty and a 
report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted . The petitioner 
was summoned to face trial. He was charge sheeted under Sections 
9(1)3 -C and 9(1)6 -C of the Control of Narcotic Substances 
(Amendment ) Act, 2022 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial.  In order t o prove its case , the prosecution produced as many 
as six witnesses. In his statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. 
the petitioner raised his plea of innocence. He neither opted 
to appear his own witness under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor 
produced any defence ev idence.  
6.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
the impugned judgment passed by the High Court is against 
law and facts; that the impugned judgment is suffering from 
misreading or non -reading of evidence on the record; that the 
prosecution has  failed to prove its case against the petitioner 
and that the impugned judgment is based on presumptions 
and assumptions, thus liable to be set aside.  
7.  Conversely, the learned Law Officer has faithfully 
defended the impugned judgment being based on prop er 
appreciation of evidence.  
8.  Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner so 
also the learned Law Officer at great length and scanned the 
material available on the record with their able assistance. It 
reflects from the record that all the prosecution witnesses in 
their statements have unanimously given details qua raid, 
arrest of the petitioner, search, recovery of the contraband , Criminal Petition No. 474-L of 2024        - 4 - 
 
   preparation of samples , its safe transmission to the police 
station, safe custody and the delivery thereof to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency  (PFSA) . During cross -examination ,  
the prosecution witnesses remained consistent . The report of 
the PFSA confirms the nature of the contraband recovered 
from the possession of the petitioner.  
9.   Nothing has been brought on the reco rd by the 
prosecution to falsely implicate the petitioner in the 
commission of an offence. All aspects of the matter , legal as 
well as factual,  have elaborately been dealt with by the Courts 
below  and the reasons and conclusions drawn are apt. 
Learned coun sel for the petitioner has failed to point out any 
misreading or non -reading so also infirmity or illegality on the 
record justifying interference by this Court.  
10.   For what has been discussed above, this petition 
bereft of merit is dismissed and leave  is declined.  Above are the 
reasons of our short order pronounced on event date.
