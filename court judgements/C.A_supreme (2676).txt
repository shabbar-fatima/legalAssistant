this matter. But we have told him that as a lawyer he must be 
aware that he has to get his licence revive d, though we know 
that th ere are examples where during the era when there was no 
constitutional dispensation in the country, Ministers had been 
appearing before the Courts as lawyers, but now as there is 
constitutional dispensation and institutions are functioning under Reference 1 of 2011  
Order dt. 13.04.2011  2 
the Consti tution , therefore, such exercise should not be 
repeated. On this , he stated that he has prepared his resignation, 
which was placed before us for our pe rusal along with another 
document  whereby he has been authorized by the President to 
appear in Court. How ever, resignation has to be tendered to the 
President, who is the competent authority to accept the same. 
We appreciate that realizing importance of the case,  Dr. Babar 
Awan , Minister for Law  has tendered his resignation and his 
licence is likely to be revived during the course of the day.  In
