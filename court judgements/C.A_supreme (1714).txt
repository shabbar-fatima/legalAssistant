ORDER  
 
  Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, C .J. —  The Commission on 
Oil and Gas Products Pricing Mechanism has submit ted its report. The 
Registrar may supply copy of the same to the petitioner s and all the 
respondents on costs.  Similarly, spare copies shall be supplied to the 
Hon’ble Members of the Bench for their perusal. The learned counsel 
appearing for the parties sh all come prepared for preliminary consideration 
of the report on the next date of hearing.  
2.  Listed C.M.A. No. 2080/2009 has been filed on behalf of the 
petitioner in Constitution Petition No. 33/2009 with the prayer that the 
notification dated 30th June, 2009/1st July 2009 issued and enforced by the 
Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority, Islamabad ( OGRA ) and respondents No.1  
& 2 be suspended till the final disposal of the cases.  
3.   The learned counsel for the applicant contended that carbon 
tax was imposed in place of Petroleum Development Levy  (PDL)  in 
pursuance of the Finance Act, 2009 whereby the Petroleum Products 
(Petroleum Development Levy ) Ordinance , 1961 ( Ordinance No. XXV  of 
1961 ) was amended. According to the learned counsel, there was neither 
any statement of object s nor any document was placed on record to show 
that carbon surcharge in place of PDL was essential. According to him , the 
known object for the imposition of the carbon tax was to provide petroleum  3 
products free of carbon  dioxide to the citizens so as to minimize the 
pollution . Therefore , unless the Ministry of Environment had spel t out the 
object s and purposes for imposing carbon surcharge, the Government 
could not have issued the notification  in question . According to him , even if 
amend ment of law had taken place , the government ought to have 
withheld the notification until it was able to provid e petroleum products free 
of carbon and the consequential pollution  free environment . He further 
stated that while replacing PDL with the carbon tax, ex-refinery prices of 
other components were  increased tremendously and sales tax wa s also 
being charge d on all the components , though there was no such provision 
in the Sales Tax Act, 1990  which  authoriz ed the Custom s Department to 
levy such a tax along with  other taxes .  
4.   On the other hand , Khwaja  Saeed -uz-Zafar, ASC appearing 
for the OGRA stated that as f or as PDL was concerned, it was replaced 
with the carbon tax and no fresh tax was imposed. As to the increase in 
prices of other components, the learned counsel stated that it was done in 
view of the prices of the petroleum products prevailing in the international 
market. On the Court query , he gave the following break -up of the prices of 
petrol, diesel and kerosene oil as they stood on 30th June,  2009 and 1st 
July, 2009: -

A cu rsory view of the above comparative statement clearly shows that 
petroleum development levy has been replaced with carbon tax and mainly 
the ex-refinery price of the petroleum products as well as sales tax thereon 
has been increased .  
5.   The l earned Atto rney General s ubmitted  that he ha d not 
received notice of the aforesaid application . However , he stated that the 
prices of the petroleum products were required to be increased due to 
many factors, such as the rates prevailing in the international market , the 
budgetary demands  for running the affairs of the country , provision of 
subsidies on various items, e.g. wheat , etc. He stated that t he budget was 
already deficit .   
6.     We have heard the learned counsel for the parties as well as 
the learned Attorney  General and have gone through the above 
comparative statement . On the pricing mechanism of petroleum products , 
a Commission has already been constituted by this Court, which has 
submitted its report . The question raised before us requires deep er 
considera tion in the light of the report of the Commission and the  5 
provisions of the Constitution, e.g.,  Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution as 
well as the Preamble of the Constitution, which guarantees social justice . 
7.  Having gone through the amendment in the  Petroleum 
Product s (Petroleum Development Levy)  Ordinance , 1961 as introduced 
by the Finance Act, 2009,  prima facie , we are of the view that there was no 
justification for imposi tion of carbon surcharge in place of PDL because 
such a tax could be imposed subject to certain conditions , such as  
provision of petroleum products free of lead or carbon dioxide  and 
consequential pollution free atmosphere  to all citizens . Further, it was also 
necessary that the Ministry of Environment  had demanded  funds for the 
purpose of catering to its requirements of providing pollution free 
atmosphere to the general public. Such funds would only be used for the 
purpose of pollution free atmosphere. It was not a new tax because it was 
in force in other countries but at the same time they were providing 
pollution free atmosphere .  This tax could be imposed upon the price of the  
compo nents but not upon the tot al price after adding sales tax, etc.   
8.  In view of the above  facts and circumstances , the operation of 
the impugned notification to the extent of imposition of carbon tax is hereby 
suspended  pending decision of the petition s before this Court . The OGRA 
and concerned authorities are directed to issue notification which shall be 
applicable from 8th July, 2009. This arrangemen t has been made 
temporarily . The final decision in this behalf will be taken  after hearing of 
the main petition s and after taking into consideration the report of the 
Commission as  well as other components which have been referred 
hereinabove.  
9.  The Secretary , Ministry of  Environment, Government of 
Pakistan is directed to appear in person along  with the summary placed  6 
before the Cabinet  demand ing additional funds for carrying out projects  to 
provid e pollut ion free atmosphere or other similar object s on the basis of 
which request for imposition of  carbon  surcharge  was made .  
  Adjourned to 9th July, 2009.
