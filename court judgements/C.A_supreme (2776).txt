ORDER  
 
IFTIKHAR  MUHAMMAD  CHAUDHRY,  CJ – Instant  case has been 
initiated under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan regarding massive corruption in the arrangements  of Hajj for 
the year 2010.  
2.  The word Hajj (the holy pilgrimage)  means  “to intend  a 
journey ” which  connotes  both the outward  act of a journey  and the 
inward  act of intentions . Hajj is a worship  which  used to be performed 
even during pre-Islamic  period.  Although the Arabs  had forgotten most 
of the teachings  of the Abrahamic  religion , yet they, regarding  it a 
sacred duty, continued  practicing  Hajj throughout  their history . During  
that period,  tribes  from all around  the Arabian  Peninsula  used to 
congregate at Makkah. Like the other teachings  of religion,  they had 
lost the true form of this worship  and introduced  some  new practices  
that they deemed  appropriate.  However,  the Prophet  Muhammad 
(Peace be Upon Him ) revived the same among  the Muslim s according 
to Shariat -e-Muhammadi.   SMC 24/10  3 
3.  Hajj has a great significance among  the basic tenets  of 
Islam . Allah Almighty  has made  it compulsory  for all Muslims, including  
male and female , to perform  it at least once in their lifetime , if they 
can afford . It is ordained  in the Holy Quran  by the Allah Almighty,  
“And whosoever  can afford  should  visit the House  on 
pilgrimage  as duty to God. Whosoever  denies  should  remember  
that God is above  heed  of the world ” (3:97).  The Holy Prophet  
(Peace be Upon Him)  while highlighting  the importance  of Hajj said,  
“If a man unhindered  by a compelling  necessity,  or a tyrant  
ruler,  or a disabling  disease  dies without  offering  Hajj , God 
doesn ’t care if he dies the death  of a Jew or a Christian ” (Darmi , 
No: 1792) . Hajj is one of the main pillars  of Islam,  including  Tuheed,  
Namaz,  Roza and Zakat.  The Prophet  (Peace Be Upon Him ) once 
answering  a question  said, “Islam  means  that you openly  state  
that there  is no god except  Allah,  and Muhammad  (Peace Be 
Upon Him ) is the Messenger  of Allah;  establish  the prayer,  pay 
Zakah ; fast during  the month  of Ramadan  and offer  the Hajj of 
the House  of Allah  if you are able to afford  journey  to it” (Muslim , 
No: 8). The Prophet  (Peace Be Upon Him ) at some other place said, 
“Islam  is based  on five fundamentals:  to proclaim  that there  is 
no god but Allah  and Muhammad  (Peace Be Upon Him ) is the 
Messenger  of Allah,  and to establish  the prayer,  and pay Zakah,  
to offer  pilgrimage  of the House  [of God]  and to fast during  
Ramadan ” (Bukhari,  No: 7).  
4.  For the weak and women,  Hajj is a Jehaad  (holy crusade,  
supreme  effort).  Past sins of the pilgrim  are erased  and poverty  is 
removed,  as the blacksmith ’s furnace  separates  dross  from iron. Allah SMC 24/10  4 
Almighty  forgives  “Haaji” (the pilgrim)  and those  too for whom  he 
prays.  The Prophet  (Peace Be Upon Him ) once said, “One who offers  
Hajj in His way and doesn ’t speak  obscene  language,  and 
doesn ’t commit  sins, will come  back  [purified]  as he was at the 
time of his birth ” (Bukhari , No: 1421) . According  to Islamic  
injunctions,  the reward  of Hajj (accepted  by Allah Almighty)  is nothing  
but paradise.  A Haaji will intercede  for four hundred  of his family 
members  on the Day of Judgment.  It is also important  because  one 
who performs  Hajj gets to experience  what life was like as a Muslim  
during  the Prophet  Muhammad ’s time.  
5.  Hujaj (the pilgrims)  are delegates,  guests  of Allah 
Almighty . Allah summoned  them and they presented  themselves  to His 
service.  They supplicated  Him and He granted  them.  One who leaves  
his home  for Hajj and dies in the way will keep gaining  the reward  of 
every  year’s Hajj till Qiyamah  (the ultimate Judgment Day ). He will not 
be made  to account for his doings  on the Judgment Day and will be 
entered  into heavens  without  reckoning.   
6.  In order  to obey the command  of Allah almighty,  Muslims  
all over the world  travel  to Makkah , Saudi  Arabia  where  the Baitullah  is 
situated.  The pilgrimage  occurs  from the 8th to 12th of the month  of 
Zul-Hijjah , the last month  of the Islamic  calendar . About  three  million  
Muslims  perform  Hajj each year out of which  approximately  two million  
foreign  pilgrim s visit Makkah .  
7.  Since  the independence , the Government of Pakistan  has 
been making Hajj arrangements and hundreds of thousands of pilgrims 
travel to Makkah  for performance of Hajj. The Hajj arrangements are 
made in an effective manner and generally there were no  complaints SMC 24/10  5 
at large scale by Hujaj  regarding mismanagement and irregularities 
committed by the concerned authorities  of Pakistan . In the year 2010,  
some  irregularities  and instances  of corruption  were highlig hted in 
print and electronic  media.  Inasmuch  as, one of the Senators,  Khalid  
Mehmood  Soomro  in TV Programme   " دﻧﯿﺎ ﻣﯿﺮے اۤﮔﮯ "  broadcast by a 
private  channel,  requested  this Court  through  electronic  media  to 
initiate  probe  into the matter.  Prior to the request  made  by the 
Parliamentarians,  H.E. Prince  Bander  Bin Khalid  Bin Abdul  Aziz al-Saud 
sent a letter  to this Court  alleging  corruption  and embezzlement  in 
Hajj arrangements  on the part of the officials , who were responsible  in 
the hiring  accommodation  for the Hujja j. In pursuance  of said letter,  
vide order  dated  29.10.2010 comments  were called  from Secretary,  
Religious  Affairs  and the Ministry  of Foreign  Affairs.   
8.  In the meantime,  a news item was published  in the Daily 
Dawn  dated  07.11.2010 titled  “Hajj Accommodation  Scam  “, wherein  
a Senator  demand ed a ‘House  Committee ’ to probe  into the allegations  
containe d in the letter  of the Saudi  Prince,  addressed  to this Court  
(Chief Justice ) about  exorbitant  rent being  charged  from Pakistani  
pilgrims  for their accommodations  in Makkah.  Similarly,  a report  titled, 
" ﺣﺞ اﻧﺘﻈﺎﻣﺎت ﻣﯿﮟ ھﻮﻧﮯ واﻟﯽ ﮐﺮﭘﺸﻦ"  was published  in the ‘Daily Nawa -i-Waqt’ on 
10.11.2010, alleging  therein  that the former  DG, Hajj Rao Shakeel  
Ahmed  was appointed  to the office  in violation  of the rules,  with a view 
to facilitate  him in indulging  in corruption.   
9.  In addition  to that, a representation  was submitted  to Mr. 
Justice  (R) Khalil -ur-Rehman  Ramday,  Judge (as he then was) by 
some  of the Hujjaj  complaining  ill treatment  during  the Hajj, which 
was forwarded  to one of us (Chief Justice ) with the following  remarks:  SMC 24/10  6 
 “A large number  of persons  came  to me in Makkah  
Mukarramah  and even in Mina complaining  of grave  
mismanagement  in the Hajj arrangements  regarding  the 
buildings  hired in Makkah  and Madina  and the 
accommodation  in Mina.  The stories  narrated  were 
pathetic.  Complaints  were made  even in writing.  I appear  
to have misplaced  those  written  complaints,  but two of 
them are available  with me, which  I am placing  before  
you for such action  as may be deemed  appropriate  to 
eliminate  the sufferings  of thousands  of Hajis who collect  
pennies  all their lives to perform  Hajj and this is how the 
money  earned  by them through  their blood  and sweat  is 
wasted.  “ 
The matter  was ordered  to be heard  in the Court vide order  dated  
02.12.2010 and the hearing  of the case commenced  under  Article  
184(3)  of the Constitution  of Islamic  Republic  of Pakistan,  1973.  
During  hearing  of the case, it was reveale d that the Ministry  of Hajj 
had charged  SR 700 from each Haji for providing  them suitable  
accommodation  in Mina, however,  they were not provided  
accommodation  despite  collecting  the rent from them and were made  
to suffer  the agony  of non-accommodation . Therefore,  vide order  
dated  13.12.2010  the Secretary,  Ministry  of Religious  Affairs  was 
directed  to refund  the said amount  of SR 700 to the pilgrims  and 
submit  certificate  to that effect before  the Court . In pursuance  of the 
aforesaid  directions,  the Government  of Pakistan  reimbursed  an 
amount  of Rs.470 million  to about  25000  Hujjaj , towards  the rent 
charged  from them.  
10.  The investigation  of the matter  was entrusted  to Federal  
Investigation  Agency  (FIA) and Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  Director,  FIA with SMC 24/10  7 
the rank of DIG, Police  was appointed  as head of the investigating  
team. It was informed that an accused namely Ahmad  Faiz s/o 
Muhammad  Shafi had been arrested  and interrogated  in Kingdom  of 
Saudi Arabia, therefore, incriminating  evidence  was to be collected  
from there . In order to collect evidence and to determinat e the 
accusation of the persons involved  in crime,  directly  or indirectly , the 
FIA team proceed ed to Saudi  Arabia,  where  all transactions  took place,  
funds  (ill-gotten  money)  were transferred/remitted  and the concerned  
officials  and private  persons  were located.   
11.   One of the Federal  Minister s was leveling  the allegation  of 
corruption  against  another  Federal  Minister ; therefore,  in order  to 
ensure  the fair and transparent investigation  of the case, this Court  
desired  that the facts be brought  in the notice  of the Prime  Minister,  
who may personally  look into the matter  and ensure  that the 
investigation  is conducted  without  influen ce of any official  against  
whom  allegations  of corruption  and or corrupt  practices  have been 
levelled.  
12.  As a result  of investigation,  many  criminal  cases  were 
registered  against  various  accused  persons . First case was registered  
vide FIR No. 5/2010 dat ed 12.11.2010 under sections 
409/420/467/468/471/109/3/4 PPC read with section 5(2) Prohibition 
of Corruption Act, 1947. Second case was registered vide FIR 
No.06/2010 dated 20.12.2010 against Malik Abdullah Mehmood 
Khokhar (brother -in-law of Syed Hamid Sa eed Kazmi) on the 
allegation that he received an amount of Rs.200,000/ - as token money 
from one Raja Tariq Mehmood resident of Rawalpindi for providing Hajj SMC 24/10  8 
Quota for 110 individuals against the payment of Rs.2,200,000/ - (2.2 
million) @Rs.20,000/ - per pers on which was to be paid later on. Third  
case was registered vide FIR No.1/2011 dated 15.02.2011 against 
Zain Iftikhar Sukhera and Majeebullah Malik  with t he allegations that 
Zain Iftikhar Sukhera fraudulently obtained job of IT Consultant (BS -
20) in the M inistry of Information Technology, Islamabad by 
misrepresenting himself and using fake Certificates/Degree.  Yet 
another case was registered vide FIR No.3/2011 dated 17.03.2011 
against Shakeel Ahmad Rao, former DG Hajj; Mr. Ismail Qureshi, 
former Secretary Establishment Division; S.M. Tahir, the then JS (T), 
Establishment Division and some other persons for maneuvering 
appointment of Shakeel Ahmad Rao as DG Hajj in violation of rules 
and the law as he was over age, on ECL, facing trial in Accountability 
Court in Lahore and a reference was pending against him with NAB, 
Punjab . 
13.  It is permanent to mention here  that Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  
who was heading  the investigation  team,  started  unfolding  different  
aspects  of the case and collected  sufficient  material  against influential  
persons  including  the politicians  and Government  Officers.  In the 
meantime,  Syed Jawaid  Ali Shah Bokhari,  was posted  as Additional  
Director  General,  FIA. After his appointment,  without  assigning  any 
reason,  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  was disassoc iated from the investigation  
and Syed Jawaid  Ali Shah was assigned  the said task . However,  he 
disassociated  himself  for which  his explanation  was sought.  In his 
reply, he explained  that as his promotion  was due in grade -22, 
therefore,  he wanted  to avail the chance.  The Government  was 
directed  to initiate  departmental  proceedings  against  him as he had SMC 24/10  9 
refused  to perform  his duties.  It is to be noted  that the result  of the 
departmental  proceedings  has not been communicated  to this Court.   
14.  Malik Muhammad  Iqbal,  in the meanwhile,  took over the 
charge  as DG, FIA and Mr. Hussain  Asghar  was transferred  to Gilgit -
Baltistan  as Inspector  General  of Police . He was posted  out on the 
basis of a report submitted by the DG, FIA, wherein it was dishonestly  
mentioned  that he had  completed the investigation and the chal lans in 
the said cases had been submitted before the Courts  knowing  well that 
Mr. Hussain  Asghar  was conducting  investigation  of an important  case 
in which  not only the pilgrims  had been looted  but it had also brought  
a bad name  to the country.   
15.   After the transfer  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  things  came to a 
standstill  and no progress  in the investigation  was made . This Court  
was of the view that Malik Muhammad  Iqbal,  DG, FIA being  a senior  
officer  instead  of ensuring  to accelerate  progress  of the investigation  in 
the right direction , started  hampering  the investigation  after taking  
over the charge , therefore,  he was called  upon to explain  as to why in 
the mid of the investigation  when  the case was proceedin g towards  its 
logical end, he spared  and relieved  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  without  
bringing  it in the notice  of this Court.  Thereafter,  the then  DG, FIA sent 
a letter  for reposting  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  but no response  was 
received  from the competent  authority.   
16.   On 10.06.2011,  the then Secretary  Establishment  Division  
and DG, FIA appeared  in Court  and sought  time to enable  them to 
approach  the competent  authority  for reposting  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar  
in the FIA. The Court  directed  the Secretary,  Establishmen t to 
immediately  issue transfer  orders  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar  as Director,  SMC 24/10  10
FIA, enabling  him to resume  his duty and continue  to investigate  the 
case, otherwise  he had to face the proceedings  for non-compliance  of 
the order.  He was also directed  to place on record  the list of the 
officers  available  at that time when  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  was posted  as 
IG, Gilgit-Baltistan . The then DG, FIA was directed  to provide  every  
cooperation  and assistance  to Mr. Hussain  Asghar  and his team which  
was already  conducting  the investigation.   
17.   The then Secretary  Establishment  forwarded  a summary  
for the reposting  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar  but the needful  was not done,  
therefore,  on 26.07.2011 in compliance  of judicial  order , he issued  
notification  of transfer  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar to FIA. However,  Mr. 
Hussain  Asghar  did not report  to the FIA Headquarter  and the then 
learned  Attorney  General  for Pakistan  informed  the Court  that no 
direct  contact  had been established  with him except  information  
collected  form the documents  from the Chief Secretary,  Gilgit-Baltistan  
that the said administration  had declined  to relieve  him without  
provision  of replacement.  The report  of the Attorney  General  dated  
28.07.2011 is reproduced  hereinbelow : - 
(i) ADG Mr. Muhammad  Manzoor  tried to contact  from his cell 
number  0321-9480003  with Mr. Hussain  Asghar  on his cell 
phone  number  0345-3056663  & .0355 -5550161  but the same  
were not responding.  
(ii) DIG HQ Gilgit Baltistan  Police  was contacted  to know  about  IGP 
(Mr. Hussain  Asghar).  He informed  that the IGP was in Skardu  
but he is having  no contact  with him. The DIG however,  Faxed  a 
copy of the Service  Department,  Government  of Gilgit Baltistan  
Notification  dated  26-7-2011 addressed  to IGP, containing  
directions  that  “the Chief Minister  Gilgit Baltistan  has verba lly 
directed  you not to relinquish  the charge  of IG Police  Gilgit 
Baltistan  without  approval  of the competent  authority  (Chief  
Minister,  GB) and without  provision  of your replacement  “ …, SMC 24/10  11
(iii) DIG HQ was asked  to establish  contact  with IGP and inform  him 
about  the orders  of Hon’ble Supreme  Court  of Pakistan,  dated  
27-7-2011.  He was also asked  to communicate  with SP Skardu  
for locating  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  and deliver  the message  to IGP 
by utilizing  wireless  communication  network.  
(iv) The copies  of the orders  of Hon’ble Supreme  Court  of Pakistan  
dated  27-7-2011 have separately  been faxed  to the Chief 
Secretary,  Government  of Gilgit Baltistan  (fax No.05811 -
920144)  and the Inspector  General  Police  G.B. (fax No.05811 -’ 
930015)  for immediate  compliance.  
(v) Director  General  FIA gives an assurance  to the apex court that 
as and when  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  reports  for duty in FIA, the 
investigation  of Hajj Scam  cases  will be handed  over to him and 
the investigation  team,  already  working  with him, will be re-
attached  with the officer.  He will also be facilitated  in all 
manners  to carry put the investigation  of the Hajj Scam  cases.  
          Sd/- 
Syed Tahsin  Anwar  Ali Shah  
Director  General/FIA  28.7.2011 “ 
Thereafter,  vide notification  dated  26.07.2011,  Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  the 
then Secretar y Establishment,  who in compliance  with the order  of this 
Court  had issued  notification  of transfer  of Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  was 
made  OSD. Relevant  para of the said notification  reads  as follows:  - 
 “Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  a BS-22 officer  of Secretariat  Group,  
presently  posted  as Secretary,  Establishment  Division,  is 
transferred  and posted  as OSD, Establishment  Division,  with 
immediate  effect  and until further  orders. ” 
18.   It is to be noted that p lacing  an officer  as OSD is 
tantamount  to penalizing  him because  the expression  ‘OSD’ is not 
known  to either  the Civil Servant  Act, 1973 or the Civil Servants  
(Appointment  Promotion  and Transfer)  Rules,  1973.  Therefore , this 
Court  was of the view that a civil servant  like Mr. Sohail  Ahmad,  who 
stood  for supremacy  of the Constitution  and rule of law, by obeying SMC 24/10  12
the judicial  order,  should  not have been  penalized  by making  him 
OSD. These  facts were incorporated  in order  dated  27.07.2011,  
relevant  paras  therefrom  read as under:  - 
 “3. It has been reported  in the Electronic  and Print Media  that 
Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  Secretary  Establishment  has been removed  
from his office  and has been made  OSD. This development  has 
taken  place soon after the issuance  of the Notification  by him 
transferring  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  from the office  of the Inspector  
General  of Police  Gilgit Baltistan  to Director  FIA to enable  him to 
continue  the investigation  of the Hajj corruption  scam.  In fact 
the Secretary  Establishment  in compliance  with the orders  of 
this Court,  has issued  the notification  of transfer  of Mr. Hussain  
Asghar  as Director  FIA. 
5.  Needless  to observe  that this Court  is of the considered  
view that once a judicial  order  is passed,  it has binding  effect  on 
the Executive  as well as Judicial  functionaries  in terms  of 
Articles  5 and 190 of the Constitution  of Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan.  Therefore,  the attention  of Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  
Secretary  Establishment  was drawn  towards  these  Constitutional  
provisions,  non-compliance  of which  would  have exposed  him 
liable to contempt  proceedings.  This fact finds place in our order  
passed  in the earlier  past of the day on 26-7-2011.  However,  
Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  Secretary  Establishment  has complied  with 
the order  after tea break  when  the Court  assembled  for further  
hearing  and placed  the copy of the notification  in terms  of order  
of this Court.  The language  of the notification  clearly  speaks  this 
fact that the notification  was issued  in compliance  with the 
orders  of this Court  which  act on his part was in discharge  of his 
Constitutional  commitment  as required  under  Article  190 of the 
Constitution.  Such officer  cannot  be penalized  inter alia on the 
ground  that he issued  the notification  in violation  of the rules.  
The Secretary  Establishment  has issued  the notification  in 
compliance  with the order  of this Court  dated  25-7-2011 and 
26-7-2011.  If such officer  is made  OSD it will not send a good 
message  to the country.  
7.  The manner  in which  Mr. Sohail  Ahmed,  Secretary  SMC 24/10  13
Establishment  has been penalized  persuade  us to have strong  
reasons  to believe  that it was an act design ed to frustrate  the 
orders  of this Court.  The immediate  reaction  shown  by the 
Competent  Authority  was not called  for, because  Mr. Sohail  
Ahmed  has obeyed  the judicial  order,  which  he was bound  under  
the Constitution,  which  is a sacred  document  and every  
authority  in the country  is bound  to follow  it; if any Authority  
makes  a departure  from any of its provisions,  it is likely to lead 
to chaos  in the country  which  may lead to serious  
consequences.  Such an eventuality  ought  to be avoided  by all 
persons  in authority. Under  the Constitution,  if this Court  passes  
orders,  it should  be complied  with and no approval  of any 
authority  in Executive  is required  for its implementation.  The 
rules or even statutes,  which  are subordinate  to the Constitution  
could  not place bar on the authority  of this Court  to seek the 
enforcement  of its orders.  
9.  At this stage,  we have asked  the learned  Attorney  
General  for Pakistan,  in whose  presence  this order  has been 
dictated,  to contact  the Competent  Authority  and convey  the 
above  order and also ensure  that Mr. Sohail  Ahmed  be 
reinstated  as Secretary  Establishment  and the notification/order  
of his being  posted  as OSD be withdrawn.  The Attorney  General  
shall submit  the report  in writing  in this behalf  i.e. whatever  he 
has communicated  to the Competent  Authority  and the reply he 
has received  in response  thereto.  “ 
19.  This Court  considered  all the facts and circumstances  of 
the case as well as the law and the ruling s on the subject  and vide 
order  dated  29.07.2011  reported  as Corruption  in Hajj Arrangements  
in 2010 (PLD 2011 SC 963),  held as under:  - 
(1) The Notification  dated  26th July, 2011 issued  by the 
Secretary  Establishment  Division,  Government  of Pakistan,  
whereby  Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  presently  posted  as Inspector  
General,  Gilgit-Baltistan  under  Kashmir  Affairs  and Gilgit-
Baltistan  Division,  was transferred  and posted  as Director,  FIA 
under  Ministry  of Interior  in pursuance  of the order  of this Court  SMC 24/10  14
dated  25th July, 2011 passed  in the instant  case, shall be 
implemented  in letter  and spirit by the Government,  i.e. the 
Secretary  Interior  and Secretary  Establishment  by adopting  all 
appropriate  measures;  
(2) The Notification  No.F.41/335/2009 -E-I dated  26th July, 
2011,  placing  Mr. Sohail  Ahmed  as OSD is not sustainable  in 
law. However,  it is the prerogative  of the competent  authority  to 
post him either  as Secretary  Establishment  or give him any 
other  assignment  commensurate  with his status,  performance,  
ability  and work etc., as early as possible,  but not later than a 
period  of 7 days from the date of receipt  of this order.  If no 
order  of his posting  and transfer  is passed  on or before  the 
stipulated  period,  the aforesaid  Notification  placing  him as OSD 
shall cease  to have effect  and he shall be deemed  to be 
Secretary  Establishment  until otherwise  transferred  and posted  
elsewhere  by the competent  authority;  
(3) The DG, FIA shall take all necessary  steps  to ensure  that 
no sooner  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  reports  for duty, the investigation  
team working  earlier  with him will be provided  to him and shall 
be extended  all the facilities  so that he can complete  
investigation  of mega  corruption  in Hajj arrangements.  In the 
meanwhile,  DG, FIA shall also submit  report  for our perusal  
after every  7 days of the progress  in the investigation  of the 
case. 
Despite  clear orders  of this Court  as well as issuance  of notification  of 
transfer of Mr. Hussain  Asghar  from the post of IG Police,  Gilgit-
Baltistan , he did not join as Director,  FIA.  
20.   It is to be noted  that in somewhat  similar  circumstances,  
when  many  police officers  after transfer to the province of Balochistan 
did not join their duties,  this Court  directed  that if the transferred  
police  officers  decline  or fail to obey the orders  of the competent  
authority,  disciplinary  proceedings  should  be initiated  against them 
[President Balochistan High Court Bar Association v. Federation of SMC 24/10  15
Pakistan  (Const. Petition No. 77/2012 )]. In line with said directions,  in 
the instant  case too, the Secretaries,  Establishment  Division  and 
Interior  were directed  to follow  the same course  of action  and 
implement  the orders  of this Court,  failing  which  they were to appear  
before  the court in person.  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  did not join FIA, 
therefore,  it was clarified  vide order  dated  05.06.2012  that the 
Secretary  Establishment  is bound to proceed  against  him not only for 
violating  the order  of competent  authority  but also orders  of this 
Court.   
21.   Secretary,  Establishment,  vide Memo  dated  05.06.2012,  
directed  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  to immediately  relinquish  the charge  in 
Government  of Gilgat-Baltistan  and report  to FIA, failing  which  he 
would  be proceeded  against  in terms  of rule 5(1)(iii)  of E&D rules,  
1973.  As Mr. Hussain  Asghar,  failed  to comply  with the directions  of 
the competent  authority,  disciplinary  proceedings  were initiated  
against him and on 27.06.2012  a summary  was sent to Prime  Minister  
of Pakistan  for approval  of authorized  officer.  Resultantly,  Mr. Hussain  
Asghar  was suspended  vide notification  dated  18.07.2012.   
22.  One of the main accused  in the Hajj scam,  namely,  Hamid  
Saeed  Kazmi,  former  Minister  for Religious  Affairs  was granted  bail on 
statutory  ground  of delay  in the conclusion  of trial. It was for the 
reason  that the case could  not be proceeded/concluded  within  
reasonable  time as the post of Special  Judge  (Rawalpin di) remained  
vacant , therefore,  the Federal  Government  was directed  to ensure  
appointment  to the said post expeditiously.   
23.  In the meantime,  it was informed  that Mr. Hussain  Asghar  SMC 24/10  16
had returned from Gilgit to Islamabad  but on account  of departmental  
proceedings  he was not allowed to join as Director FIA as he was 
under  suspension.  It was made  clear by the Court  that as he had been 
transferred  to FIA for the purpose  of conducting  investigation  of Hajj 
scam,  pending  decision  of the departmental  proceeding s, he may 
takeover  charge  as Director,  FIA and start investigation  of the matter.  
As such,  Mr. Hussain  Asghar  started  the investigation  of the cases.   
24.  Vide order  dated  24.03.2011,  the FIA was restrained  to 
cause  the arrest , without  the leave  of this Court, of Mr. Muhammad  
Ismail  Qureshi,  the then Secretary  (Establishment),  who succeeded  in 
making  appointment  of Rao Shakeel  Ahemd  as DG, Hajj. On 
08.04.2011,  the FIA was directed  that he may not be arrested  till 
further  orders.  However,  on 13.11.2012,  it was informed  that due to 
above  said order,  the FIA was handicapped  to further  interrogate  the 
case on that issue.  In such view of the matter,  notice  was issued  to 
Mr. Muhammad  Ismail  Qureshi , the then Secretary Establishment.   
25.   On 09.04.2013,  Mr. Hussain Asghar  informed  that accused  
Ahmed  Faiz had been declared  proclaimed  offender  and though  his 
passport  had been cancelled  and red warrants  had been issued,  he 
could  not be arrested  from Saudi  Arabia.  A treaty  for extradition  of 
persons  involved  in criminal cases  existed  between  Saudi  Arabia  and 
Pakistan  but the Saudi  Government  informed that Interior  Ministry  of 
Pakistan  should  take up the matter  with its counter  part in this regard.  
Regarding  appointment  of Zain Iftikhar  Sukhera  and Rao Shakeel  
Ahmed  as Incharge,  IT and DG, Hajj respectively,  the then Prime  
Minister  Syed Yousaf  Raza Gilani  was required  by FIA to join the SMC 24/10  17
investigation,  however,  vide letter  dated  01.03.2012,  issued  by M/o 
Law & Justice,  Government  of Pakistan  informed  the FIA that he, being 
the Prime  Minister,  has immunity  under  Article  248(1)  of the 
Constitution.  The Court  directed  to issue notice  to Syed Yousaf  Raza 
Gilani  to appear  in person.  It was further  informed  that Mr. 
Muhammad  Ismail  Qureshi  after obtaining  protective  bail on 
06.04.2012  from Lahore  High Court,  instead  of joining  the 
investigation  had left for America.      
26.   The case remained  pending  for many  years  in this Court,  
during  hearing  whereof  following  issues  surfaced:  - 
(1) Corruption  was done by political  persons  as well as 
officers  in the higher  echelons  of government  due to 
which  Hujjaj were robbed  as not only extra money  
was charged  from them but the accommodation  was 
not provided  to them at Mina; 
(2) During  investigation  of the cases  arising  out of the 
Hajj scam,  many  officers/officials,  who succeeded  in 
collecting  evidence  against  politicians/government  
officers  involved  in the corruption/looting  of money,  
were disassociated  from the investigation  and 
transferred  to other  positions;  and 
(3) Hajj tour operators  charged  Rs.500 0/- extra from 
each Haji. 
27.  As far as the first issue is concerned , it is to be noted  that 
the investigating  agency  succeeded  in registration  of many  FIRs 
against  various  accused  persons  involved  in corruption  and corrupt  
practice . In this regard,  FIR No.5/2010  dated  12.11.2010  was 
registered  under  section s 409/420/467/468/471/109/ 3/4 PPC read SMC 24/10  18
with section  5(2) Prohibition  of Corruption  Act, 1947,  wherein  four 
challans  under  section  173 Cr.PC  dated  03.01.2011,  03.05.2011,  
18.01.2012  and 08.06.2012  were submitted  in the court of Special  
Judge  (Central)  Rawalpindi  (now in Islamabad).   
28.   During  the investigation  of the said case, accused  Shakeel  
Ahmad  Rao, former  DG Hajj was arrested  on 13.11.2010  while 
accused  Aftab -ul-Islam Raja, former  JS, Hajj Minist ry of Religious  
Affairs  was arrested  on 9.12.2010  and both of them are still behind  
the bars, whereas,  Syed Hamid  Saeed  Kazmi,  former  Minister  for 
Religious  Affairs  was arrested  15.3.2011  but was released  on bail. One 
of the accused  namely  Ahmed  Faiz has not been arrested  however,  
efforts  are being  made  through  different  channels  i.e. Interpol,  
Ministry   of Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of Interior,  etc., as reportedly  he 
is stationed  at Jeddah  in Saudia  Arabia.  Properties/assets  worth  
Rs.117,652,815/ - (117.65  million)  belonging  to accused  Shakeel  
Ahmad  Rao, Syed Hamind  Saeed  Kazmi  and Ahmad  Faiz have been 
seized  under  section  5(5) of the FIA Act, 1974.  However,  International 
Letter of Request has been sent to United  Kingdom  Central  Authority,  
Judicial  Corporati on Unit, London  through  Ministry  of Foreign  Affairs  for 
obtaining  details  of Bank account  No.0008080320001  in the name  of 
Syed Hamid  Saeed  Kazmi  maintained  with United  National  Bank 
London  GB. 
29.  Another  FIR No.06/2010  dated  20.12.2010  has been 
registere d against  Malik Abdullah  Mehmood  Khokhar  (brother -in-law of 
Syed Hamid  Saeed  Kazmi)  on the allegation  that he received  an 
amount  of Rs.200,000/ - as token  money  from one Raja Tariq SMC 24/10  19
Mehmood  resident  of Rawalpindi  for providing  Hajj Quota  for 110 
individuals  against  the payment  of Rs.2,200,000/ - (2.2 million)  
@Rs.20,000/ - per person  which  was to be paid later on. During  
investigation  of the case the said accused  was arrested  on 22.12.2010 , 
the Challan  was submitted  on 07.01.2011  and the trial is in progress.  
30.  Vide FIR No.1/2011  dated  15.02.2011 , a case was 
registered  against  Zain Iftikhar  Sukhera  and Majeebullah  Malik. The 
allegations  contained  in the FIR against  Zain Iftikhar  Sukhera  are that 
he fraudulently  obtained  job of IT Consultant  (BS-20) in the Ministry of 
Information  Technology,  Islamabad  by misrepresenting  himself  and 
using  fake Certificates/Degree.  However,  pr-arrest  bail of both the 
accused  was confirmed  on 11.05.2011  by the Special  Judge  (Central)  
Rawalpindi  [now in Islamabad]  and application  for cancellation  of bail 
is pending  before  the learned  Islamabad  High Court.  The interim  
challan  in the said FIR has been submitted  on 12.03.2013.  Whereas,  
final challan  has been forwarded  to Law Officer  of FIA for onward  
submission  to the trial Court.  
31.  Yet another  case was registered  vide FIR No.3/2011  dated  
17.03.2011  against  Shakeel  Ahmad  Rao, former  DG Hajj; Mr. Ismail  
Qureshi,  former  Secretary  Establishment  Division;  S.M. Tahir,  the then 
JS (T), Establishment  Division  and some  other  persons  for 
mane uvering  appointment  of Shakeel  Ahmad  Rao as DG Hajj in 
violation  of rules and the law as he was over age, on ECL, facing  trial 
in Accountability  Court  in Lahore  and a reference  was pending  against  
him with NAB, Punjab.  S.M. Tahir accused  has been discharge d by the 
learned  High Court  vide Order  dated  10.04.2012  passed  in W.P. No. SMC 24/10  20
3519/2011.  However,  three  interim  challans  dated  30.11.2011,  
24.04.2012  and 30.05.2012  have been submitted  in the trial Court.  
Charge  against  Shakeel  Ahmad  Rao has been framed  and the trial is in 
progress.  With regard  to the role of Mr. Ismail  Qureshi,  the then 
Secretary  Establishment  Division  and the competent  Authority  i.e. the 
former  Prime  Minister  of Pakistan  who approved  the appointment  of 
Shakeel Ahmad  Rao as DG Hajj, investiga tion/probe  is still going  on. 
The final challan  has been forwarded  to the Law Officer  for submission  
before  the trial Court.  
32.  It is to be noted  that except  one accused  Ahmed  Faiz (PO) 
all the other  accused  have been arrested  and the trials have been 
going on before  the competent  Jurisdiction.  However,  the investigating  
agencies  have failed  to bring back the above  named  accused  who is 
presently  residing  in Jaddah  Saudia  Arabia  despite  existence  of a 
treaty  for extradition  of persons  involved  in criminal  cases  between  
Saudi  Arabia  and Pakistan . It was informed  that the Saudi  Government  
asked  that Interior  Ministry  of Pakistan  should  take up the matter  with 
its counter  part in this regard . The efforts  are being  made  at the 
diplomatic  channel  for his extradi tion but so far no success  has been 
achieved.  In this regard,  it may be noted  that Pakistan  is a sovereign  
State and Government is bound  to exercise  its authority  to ensure  that 
any person  involved  in a criminal  case should  be brought  to this 
country  to face the law under  the principal  of rule of Law.  
33.  The matter  of corruption  is always  of prime  concern  
throughout  the world.  In order  to achieve  the object  of elimination  of 
corruption  from the society,  a convention  known  as United  Nation’s  SMC 24/10  21
Convention  Against Corruption,  was signed  by the comity  of nations.  
The Government  of Pakistan  signed  the above  UN Convention  on 
09.12.2003  and ratified  the same  on 31.08.2007,  regarding  
international  cooperation  in criminal  matters  in accordance  with 
Articles  44 to 50 of the above  noted  UN Convention,  according  to 
which,  where  appropriate  and consistent  with their domestic  legal 
system,  the State  Parties  shall consider  assisting  each other  in 
investigation  or proceedings  in civil and administrative  matters,  
relating  to corruption.  Relevant  portion  therefrom  is reproduced  
hereinbelow  for convenience: -- 
 “The purposes  of this Convention  are: 
  
(a)  To promote  and strengthen  measures  to prevent  and 
combat  corruption  more efficiently  and effectively;  
  
(b)  To promote,  facilitate and support  international  
cooperation  and technical  assistance  in the prevention  of 
and fight against  corruption,  including  in asset recovery;  
  
(c)  To promote,  integrity  accountability’  and proper  
management  of public  affairs  and public  property.  
  
Recalling  the work carried  out by other international  and 
regional  organizations  in this field, including  the  “activities  of 
the African  Union,  the Council  of Europe,  the Customs  
Cooperation  Council  (also known  as the World  Customs  
Organization),  the European  Union,  the League  of Arab States,  
.the Organization  for Economic  Cooperation  and Development  
and the Organization  of American  States,  
  
Taking  note with appreciation  of multilateral  instruments  to 
prevent  and combat  corruption,  including  inter alia, the Inter-
American  Convention  against  Corruption,  adopted  by the 
Organization  of American  States  on 29 March  1996,  the 
Convention  on the Fight against  Corruption  involving  Officials  of 
the European  Communities  or Officials  of Member  States  of the 
European  Union,  adopted  by the Council  of the European  Union  
on 26 May 1997,  the Convention  on Combating  Bribery  of 
Foreign  Public  Officials  in International  Business  Transactions,

Development  on 212(sic)  November  1997,  the Criminal  Law 
Convention  on Corruption,  adopted  by the Committee  of 
Ministers  of the Council  of Europe  on 27 January  1999,  the Civil 
Law Convention  on Corruption,  adopted  by the Committee  of 
Ministers  of the Council  of Europe  on 4 November  1999,  and the 
African  Union  Convention  on Preventing  and Combating  SMC 24/10  22
Corruption;  adopted  by the Heads  of State and Government  of 
the African  Union  on 12 July, 2003.  
  
Welcoming  the entry into force on 29 September,  2003 of the 
United  Nations  Convention  again st Transnational  Organized  
Crime.  “ 
It is pertinent  to note here that the Kingdom  of Saudi  Arabia  has also 
signed  the above  noted  UN Convention  on 09.01.2004  and ratified  it 
on 29.04.2013.  Therefore,  the Government  Pakistan  may have also 
agitated  the matte r with the Saudi  Government  for extradition  of 
accused  Ahmed  Faiz involved  in the corruption  of large magnitude,  
under  the said Convention.  
34.   Under  the above circumstances,  we direct  the Federal  
Government  to expedite  the matter  of extradition  of said Ahmed  Faiz 
from Saudi  Arabia  to Pakistan  and ensure  his return  to Pakistan  as 
early as could be  possible  by taking  all the necessary  steps  required  in 
this regard,  so that the accused  may be placed  before  the authority  of 
law. The concerned  authorities  are also directed  to complete  
investigation  of the cases  within  shortest  possible  time and ensure  
completion  of trials as early as possible.  
35.  With regard to issue of employment of retired government 
servants, it is to be noted that section 14 of the Civil Servants  Act, 
1973 provides  the mechanism  for such appointments.  It provides  that 
a retired  civil servant  shall not be re-employ ed under  the Federal  
Government  unless  such re-employment  is necessary  in the public  
interest  and is made  with the prior approv al of the authority  next 
above  the appointing  authority , provided  that, where  the appointing  
authority  is the President,  such re-employment  may be ordered  with 
the approval  of the President.  For convenience, section 14 ibid is SMC 24/10  23
reproduced hereinbelow: - 
 “14. Employment  after retirement . (1) A retired  civil servant  
shall not be re-employed  under  the Federal  Government,  unless

36.  In the instant case, a n 8-Member Bench of this Court to ok 
up the issue of appointments after retirement in the light of the law, 
namely, section 14 ibid as well as the instructions contained in Esta 
Code, Volume -1, Edition 2007 under the heading  “Re-Employment  “ 
and the judgments of the superior courts on the  subject, and vide 
order dated 27.01.2011 reported as SUO MOTU CASE NO.24 OF 2010  
(PLD 2011 SC 277)  held that re -employment of such persons in 
services on their retirement must be made in public interest because 
re-employment against a sanctioned post is l ikely to affect the junior 
officers, who are waiting for promotion to the next higher rank as their SMC 24/10  32
right of promotion is blocked. They have to wait till such re -employed 
officer completes his contract. In the meanwhile, they have to face 
difficulties in m aintaining their seniority, etc. The promotion of an 
employee is not to be blocked to accommodate a retired officer, 
however, if the right of promotion is not blocked by re -employment, 
then such powers can be exercised, that too in an exceptional case. 
The Federal and Provincial Governments were also directed to ensure 
that if any Civil Servant or other person who has been re -employed, 
his case be examined in terms of the provisions of law and that take 
necessary steps to ensure that re -employment or employ ment on 
contract basis are not made i n violation of the relevant law . Relevant 
para therefrom is reproduced hereinbelow: - 
 “5. Learned Attorney General has also placed on record 
summary of some of the Police Officers who are re -employed on 
contract basis.  A perusal whereof indicates that prima facie 
while  they  were  re -employed, the  provisions  of  law i.e. 
section 14 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 as well as instructions 
contained in Esta Code in Volume -1, Edition 2007 under the 
heading  “Re-Employmen t “ and the judgments of the superior 
courts on the subject were not considered/adhered to. It is to be 
noted that for establishing rule of law and Constitutionalism, it is 
necessary that the relevant provisions should be followed strictly 
in letter and sp irit otherwise it would not be possible to provide 
an effective machinery in law particularly in Police Department 
to ensure law and order, so the peace in the country, at the 
same time to avoid violation of the relevant provisions of law 
noted hereinbefor e, which is tantamount to blocking the 
promotion of the Officers who have also served in the Forces 
and are waiting for their promotion but they are not getting 
chance because of the re -employment/contract awarded to the 
retired Officers. This is not only in the Police Department but for 
the purpose of achieving good governance; the same principle 
should be followed and strictly applied in other Departments as 
well. Be that as it may, we are adjourning this case and in the 
meanwhile learned Attorney -General  shall take up the matter 
with the Government/Competent Authority so it may take 
necessary steps to rectify if any omission has been committed, 
before the next date of hearing. Similarly, the learned Attorney -
General shall convey this order to the Secretar y, Establishment 
Division and the Chief Secretaries of the Provinces to ensure 
that if any Civil Servant or other person who has been re -
employed, his case be also examined in terms of the provisions 
of law and both Federal and Provincial Governments shoul d take 
necessary steps to ensure that re -employment or employment SMC 24/10  33
on contract basis are not made in violation of the relevant law.  “ 
 
37.   On 01.03.2011 the Court was informed that a Committee 
has already been constituted to look into the cases of persons  who 
were appointed on contract basis. The Court observed that 
appointments on contract basis should not be allowed to continue in 
terms of section 14 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, and the Policy 
unless the conditions specified therein are satisfied. Th e Government is 
not interested in obeying the order of the Court because so far the 
contract appointments of only 9 officers have been terminated 
whereas there is a list of more than 100 persons serving on contract 
basis in different capacities, including Secretaries awaiting orders 
thereon. This Court has more than once observed that incumbent DG, 
FIA who himself is holding this post on contract basis in a disciplined 
force, is responsible for not allowing the investigation of the instant 
case to proceed i n a transparent manner, however, despite these 
observations, no action has been taken against him.  
38.  The matter of re -employment of police officers after their 
retirement also came under consideration by this Court in the case of 
In Re: Suo Motu Case N o.16 of 2011 (PLD 2013 SC 443)  wherein on 
22.03.2013 it was held that re-employment in disciplinary force like 
Police or for that matter in any other department has to be made 
subject to section 14 of the Civil Servant s Act, 1973  read with 
instructions con tained in Esta  Code under  the heading  “Re-
Employment ”. It was further observed that undoubtedly, it is the 
Government, which has to perform its function strictly in accordance 
with law but, prima facie, re -employment of police officers (noted SMC 24/10  34
therein) wa s not in conformity with the law and the judgment o f this 
Court.  Consequently, with the approval of the Competent Authority i.e. 
Chief Minister Sindh, the contract appointments of 8 police officers 
were terminated, whereas, one of the re -employed employee, n amely, 
Mr. Waseem Ahmed, Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department 
(BS-21), who was also a former Police Officer and on retirement has 
been appointed by the Government of Sindh, tendered his resignation, 
which was accepted by the competent authority.  
39.  At this stage it is to be noted that every employee who 
comes within the government hierarchy , is subject to the law and the 
instructions applicable in that regard. As far as the case of Dr. Pakizah 
is concerned, a post was created for making her appoint ment. In such  
a way extra burden was created on the public exchequer. It is to be 
noted that no one is indispensible for any institution. People may come 
and go but the institutions continue to function. However, if the re was 
dire need to create such post,  appointment should have been made 
following the procedure prescribed in law/rules, namely, through 
advertisement or promotion from the senior most officers next below.  
40.  Hajj tour operators charged Rs.5000/ - extra from each Haji, 
which was in excess of  actual amount. Such conduct on their part is 
tantamount to looting the Hujjaj, who were performing  a sacred 
religious duty.  Claim of operators is that no such amount was received. 
As this is a question of investigation/probe, therefore, Secretary 
Ministry  of Religious Affairs is directed to refer cases of the operators 
who had been charging extra amount of Rs.5000/ - from each pilgrim, in 
addition to agreed amount for security of each of them, to FIA,      SMC 24/10  35
which shall first of all issue notice s to them to  seek their explanation. If 
they fail  to satisfy, investigation shall be carried out and all possible 
efforts shall be made to ensure refund of  said amount of Rs.5000/ - to 
each pilgrim, if has been charged and appropriate action shall be 
initiated against th em under the law for Hajj of 2010 to 2013. Secretary 
Religious Affairs shall ensure that in future no extra amount in the 
name of security etc. shall be received.  
41.   For the foregoing reasons, it is held as under:  - 
(i) Federal Investigation Agency is directed to probe into the 
matter in depth and determine as to whether the extra 
amount charged by the authorities has be en reimbursed to 
the Hujjaj or not?  
(ii) Strict measures should be adopted in future in or der to 
avoid such like incident s of corruptio n in Hajj 
arrangements, whereby not only the pilgrims  had been 
looted  but also it  had brought  a bad name  to the country.  
(iii) The Government should issue the guidelines regarding the 
Hajj arrangements including hiring of buildings for 
providing accommodat ion to Hujjaj as well as 
transportation and other facilities during Hajj.  
(iv) The FIA is directed to take strict action against all those 
persons including politicians, officers and others in 
echelons of power, who interfered with and hampered the 
investigation.  SMC 24/10  36
(v) The amount of Rs.5000/ - charged by the Hajj Tour 
Operators fro m each Haji in excess of the actual amount 
be refunded to them.  
42.   In the above terms, the case is disposed of with directions 
to all concerned authorities to submit compliance report to Registrar of 
this Court for our perusal in Chambers.
