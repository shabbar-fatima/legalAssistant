offered or requested the Court to grant permission for deposit of
consideration amount.
17. In the circumstances, the case law cited by the learned
counsel for the respondent has no relevance and is not applicable to
the facts of this case and need not to refer and discuss the same.
Same is the position of the law referred by the learned counsel for the
petitioner when we are dismissing the suit of the plaintiff-respondent,
therefore, there is no need to discuss the law cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioner. In this view of the matter, plaintiff failed to
prove the execution of Agreement to sell on the basis of which suit is
filed in accordance with law and also failed to prove the payment of
earnest money under the Agreement to sell to the defendants.
18. In this view of the matter, we convert this petition into
appeal and allow the same. The judgment and decree passed by thee
learned Peshawar High Court as well as the learned trial court and the
appellate court not being sustainable in the eye of law are set aside.
The resultantly, the suit filed by the plai DGEdent stands
dismissed. Parties to bear their own cost.
