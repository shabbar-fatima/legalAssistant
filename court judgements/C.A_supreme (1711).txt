JUDGEMENT  
 
 Sh. Azmat Saeed, J. - The Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan , 1973  envisages a parlia mentary system of 
government . It provides for a Parliament (National Assembly and the 
Senate of Pakistan) for the Federation and the Provincial Assemblies 
for the provinces . The people are to be governed by their chosen 
representatives and the Fundamental Rights including Article 17 
guaranteed under the Constitution are to be enforced . It may be 
advantageous to reproduce the said Article , which  reads as under:  -  
 
 
Freedom of association:   
(1) Every citizen shall have the right to form 
associations or union s, subject to any reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the interest of 
sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, public order 
or morality.  
  
(2) Every citizen, not being in the service of Pakistan, 
shall have the right to form or be a member of a 
political party, subject to any reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the 
sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan and such law 
shall provide that where the Federal Government 
declares that any political party has been formed 
or is operating in a  manner prejudicial to the 
sovereignty  or integrity of Pakistan, the Federal 
Government shall, within fifteen  days of such 
declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court 
whose decision on such reference shall be final.  
  
(3) Every political party sha ll account for the source of 
its funds in accordance with law.   
 
 
2.   A comprehensive mechanism is provided to facilitate the 
people  to cho ose their representatives in accordance with the 
Constitution and the laws on the subject regulating different aspects of 
the election  process includ ing Articles 218 and 219 of the Constitution Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  3 
and the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974. Under Article 218(3) , it is the duty of 
the Election Commission of Pakistan to organize and conduct  the 
election s and to make such arrangeme nts as are necessary to ensure 
that the election is conducted honestly,  justly, fairly  and in accordance 
with law , be it a general election or a bye -election. Whereas under 
Article 219 of the Constitution , the Election Commission of Pakistan is 
charged wit h the duty of preparing electoral rolls and revising the 
same periodical ly so as to enable all the eligible voters to exercise 
their right of franchise .  
3.   It may be pertinent to mention here that Constitution  
Petition No. 45 of 2007 was filed by Mohtar ma Benazir Bhut to (late)  
under Article  184(3) of the Constitution  with the prayer that the 
respondents (ECP & others) be directed to update the 
computerized/electronic voters lists to encompass the names of all 
persons entitled to vote in terms of Article  51(2) of the Constitution  
and the condition of CNIC for registration of eligible voters may be 
declared as without lawful authority and of no legal effect. The said 
petition came up for hearing before this Court on 10.08.2007, when an 
order was passed, rel evant para of which is reproduced herein below: -  
 
“2. It may be noted that the Election Commission 
has submitted parawise comments, in which a 
schedule for the additional entries in the computerized 
electoral roll 2006 -2007 has been provided, according 
to which a process has commenced from 3rd August, 
2007 and it will end on 20th December, 2007 and in 
this way 140 days are required to complete the same. 
We have minutely gone through the sa me. The time 
being consumed to complete certain steps is on the 
high side. We believe  that such exercise can be 
completed within a minimum period because the 
matter is quite simple as on the one hand ther e is Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  4 
electoral list of the voters prepared for the election  of 
2002, accordin g to wh ich the number of voters is 
71.86 mi llion whereas in the electoral list which has 
been presently prepared, number of voters has been 
shown to be 5,21,02,428. There  is approximately a 
difference of about 2 crores. Therefore, the Election 
Commission after min using (sic)  the votes, already 
recorded, has to check only in respect of the 
genuin eness or otherwise of the remaining votes and 
for that purpose, they can provide forms, etc. to those 
voters whose names have not been recorded by taking 
out the names from  original  list, through post -offices  
or any means within a  minimum time and by 
increasing the number of staff twice or thrice this 
exercise can be completed within a  period  not more 
than 30 days. However, further improvement in such 
exercise can also be made by the Commission with a 
view to minimize the period  of recording the names of 
the left over voters in exis ting electoral  list and to 
ensure that there must be fair and transparent 
election s, which are schedule d to be held in the near 
future.”   
 
4.  The case was then taken up on 04.10.200 7 when the 
representative of the ECP stated that in pursuance to the  directions of 
this Court, the exercise has been completed and 27 million voters have 
been added  in the e lectoral rolls. It was f urther  stated that  there were 
a total of 80 million people who were eligible for exercising the right of 
vote but some more time would be required to complete the printing 
and publication of the electoral lists in accordance with the rules.  
Accordingly, ECP was directed to complete the printing/publishing 
exercise  up to 25.10.2007 whereafter the list would  be placed on the 
website of the Commission.   
5.   On 07.04. 2011, Mr. Imran Khan , Chairman, Pakistan 
Tehrik -e-Insaf filed Constitution  Petition No. 31 of 2011 with , inter Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  5 
alia, the prayer  that the ECP be directed  to prepare fresh electoral rolls 
eliminating all bogus votes and introducing and incorporating the new 
eligible votes who can be verified from the releva nt database and 
record of NADRA. A nd to include the names of the voters , as per their 
addresses given in the CNIC. The petition was heard from time to time 
and necessary orders were passed.  On 04.07.2011 , the Secretary ECP 
appeared before the Court and stated that a Proforma has been 
prepared allowing the vot er to exercise his/her option to  vote either at 
the permanent place of residence or where he/she is temporarily 
residing on account of his/her place of work, etc., and  the option so 
exercised by him/her  shall be printed in the voters ’ list.  
6.  In the meanwhile, Workers Party Pakistan filed 
Constitutio n Petition No. 87 of 2011 with , inter alia , the prayer that 
the prevailing electioneering practices involving wealth, power and 
influence are against the mandate of the Constitution  and are an 
impediment to a free, fair, just and honest elections on a leve l playing 
field, which need s to be remedied. The said petition was disposed of 
by means of judgment reported as Workers’ Party Pakistan v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2012 SC 681)  wherein it was held and 
directed, inter alia , as under: -  
  
“(j) To achieve  the goal of fair, free, honest and 
just elections, accurate preparation/revision of 
electoral roll is immediately required to be 
undertaken by the Election Commission through 
credible and independent agencies. Accordingly, 
we direct the Election Commissio n to undertake 
door-to-door checking of voters’ lists and 
complete the process of updating/revision of the 
electoral rolls by engaging Army and the Frontier 
Corps to ensure transparency, if need be.”   Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  6 
 
7.  Thereafter, Constitution  Petition  No. 111 of 2012  was filed 
on behalf of Syed Munawwar Hassan, Amir Jamat -e-Islami and 2 
others with , inter alia,  the prayer that the electoral rolls prepared by 
the ECP which are tainted with  irregularities and errors in the Province 
of Sindh especially Karachi be declare d illegal, unlawful and that the 
respondents be directed to revise the electoral rolls and to correct the 
same on the basis of the present address of the voter in the city where 
he is residing. Mr. Saleem Zia, Secretary General, Pakistan Muslim 
League (N) Sindh filed Constitution  Petition No. 123 of 2012 with an 
identical prayer. On 22.11.2012, Dr. Farogh Naseem, learned ASC filed 
CMA No. 4840 of 2012 on behalf of Muttahida Qaumi Movement 
(MQM) for impleadment as a co -respondent and giving him a right of 
audience on behalf of the intervener , which was allowed on the same 
day. All these matters have been heard together.  
8.  We have heard M/s Hamid Khan, Rashid A. Razvi,          
Dr. Muhammad Shamim Rana, Dr. Farogh Naseem, Sardar Khurram 
Latif Khan Khosa, Mu hammad Munir Paracha, learned counsel for the 
parties and Mr. Dil Mohammad Alizai, learned DAG.  
9.  The main grievance raised before us by the learned 
counsel for the petitioners  is that the judgment of this Court in the 
case of Workers’ Party Pakistan  (supra) has not bee n complied with in 
its letter and spirit by the ECP, inasmuch as , there ha ve been gross 
errors and irregularities  in the preparation of the Electoral Roll of 
Karachi wherein a large number of voters have been disenfranchised  
and their name s have been removed from the Electoral Roll. In 
response to the above , a rather evasive reply has been submitted on 
behalf of the Election Commission which is of not much significant , in Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  7 
the presence of the material, placed before us , including a comparati ve 
statement of the Electoral Roll, wherein 663 electors have been 
registered to be the residents of House No.E -43, PECHS, Block -II, 
Karachi, allegedly constructed on a 120 square yards . And the 
statement made  by Dr. M. Shamim Rana, ASC that names of a large 
number of voters have been deleted from the Electoral Roll of Karachi 
and shifted to different parts of the country  arbitrarily  including his 
own vote . To further demonstrate his pleas, he has also referred to 
relevant material filed by him through CMA No.4830 of 2012. Mr. 
Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC contended that according to credible information, 
while revising the voter lists, as per commitment of the Secretary, 
ECP, made in the order dated 4.7.2011, only 10% voters were 
approached by the Electoral Staff.  
10.   Learned counsel for the petitioners further alleged that 
approximately  50% votes of the electors  of Karachi  have been shifted 
to other parts of the country and in their places , names of unverified 
voters have been inserted, which is likely to lead to  rigging in the 
forthcoming elections as a result whereof it would  not be possible to 
fulfill the command of the Constitution  of ensuring right of franchise  a 
fundamental right of each actual/real voters, whose names stand 
verified for the last 2/3 general  and bye -elections and the object of 
holding free, fair, honest and just election will be defeated unless the 
names of voters are re -verified on a door-to-door basis in accordance 
with the Constitution and the Law through their CNIC .  
11.  Sardar Khurram L atif Khan Khosa, learned counsel in 
Const.P.No.45/2007 has urged that an identical complaint was 
highlighted in the petition filed by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  (late) , the 
then Chair person of PPP invoking jurisdiction of this Court under Article Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  8 
184(3) of th e Constitution, now represented by Mr. Jehangir Badar, 
Secretary General of the Party. He has reiterated the assertion made 
by Mr. Jehangir Badar, Secretary General, Pakistan Peoples Party while 
appearing before this Court on 21.11.2012 that the Electoral Roll of 
Karachi prepared by the ECP contains gross errors/ violations , which 
need to be rectified/corrected as prayed for by  the learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of other petitioners . He has referred to the order 
of this Court dated 16.08.2007  passed in Const. Petition No.45/2007,  
wherein the ECP was directed to complete the exercise within a period 
of 30 days from the date of the said order , in the light of the 
observations made in the order dated 10.08.2007 reproduced 
hereinabove.  
12.  Dr. Farogh Nasee m, learned counsel for applicant -MQM, on 
the other hand, has contended that the exercise of prepar ation of the 
Electoral Roll s in Karachi has been completed and until the elections 
are announced, they can be varied and altered at the behest of the 
individu al voter only , and not on the request of any of the political 
parties and there is no ground for fresh revision of Electoral Roll nor 
will it be just. In this regard , he has placed reliance upon the case s 
titled as Lakshmi Charan Sen and others v. A.K.M. H assan Uzzaman 
and others  (AIR 985 SC 1233)  and C. Lakshmi Narain  v. The Chief 
Election Commission  (AIR 1997 Madras 125).   
13.  Mr. Muhammad Munir Paracha, learned counsel appearing 
for the Election Commission, on the other hand, has contended that 
the exer cise of preparing the Electoral Roll of Karachi has already been 
completed and that the Election Commission has filed its reply in which 
it has explained its position. He has contended that  annual revision of 
the Electoral Roll s of Karachi at this stage is  not permitted by law and Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  9 
such revision can only be carried out in the next year , as the law 
requires  annual revision of the Electoral Roll s. He, however , contended 
that individual grievance s, if raised in accordance with law, can always 
be entertained and  redressed  until elections are announced. Mr. Dil 
Muhammad Alizai, learned DAG has adopted the arguments of         
Mr. Muhammad Munir Paracha , learned ASC .   
14.  Adverting first to the objection raised by Dr. Farogh 
Naseem, learned counsel appearing on b ehalf of MQM that the alleged 
complaints made by the petitioners are individual in nature and 
mechanism of redressal of such individual complaint s is provided for in 
the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and the Rules framed  thereunder and the 
petitioner -political  parties have no locus standi to agitate the matter  in 
these proceedings . In the instant case , Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution has been invoked and suffice it to say that with the 
passage of time, the scope of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
184(3) of the Constitution has steadily evolved and expanded with its 
contours now well established through the successive judgments 
handed down by this Court. It has been declared that proceedings 
under Article 184(3) are not limited to adversarial proceedi ngs to be 
initiated by a wronged litigant seeking redressal of his individual 
grievance. Likewise, t he rule of locus standi has also not been held 
applicable to the cases involving questions of public importance with 
reference to enforcement of the Fundame ntal Rights , especially in the 
domain of Public Interest Litigation to ensure a meaningful protection 
of the Rule of Law to all citizens, as has been laid down in judgments 
reported as Miss Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan and another  
(PLD 1988 SC 416), Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of 
Pakistan and others  (PLD 1993 SC 473), Dr. Akhtar Hassan Khan and Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  10 
others v. Federation of Pakistan and others  (2012 SCMR 455) and 
Muhammad Yaseen v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Establishment Di vision, Islamabad and others  (PLD 2012 SC 132)].  
15.   As regards the objection to the maintainability of the 
instant petitions under Article 184(3) of the Constitution in the context  
of elections and the rights of the political parties to agitate for the due 
fulfillment of the Constitutional and legal requirements in respect 
thereof , this Court in its judgment reported as Workers’ Party  (supra ) 
has held as under: -  
 
“33. The scope of jurisdiction of this Court 
under Article 184(3) of the Constitution by no w 
is fairly settled in a plethora of case -law, 
therefore, there is no necessity to recapitulate 
the constitutional provision or to refer to the 
entire case -law for the purpose of deciding the 
question of maintainability of the instant petition. 
This Court,  in the cases of Ms. Benazir Bhutto v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1988 SC 416), Haji 
Muhammad Saifullah Khan v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 1989 SC 166) and Mian 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of 
Pakistan  (PLD 1993 SC 473) has already held 
that the ri ght to form, or be a member of a 
political party guaranteed under Article 17 of the 
Constitution subsumes the right to participate or 
contest in the election, and to form government 
if successful. The petitioners have vehemently 
averred that the impugned p ractices violate the 
fundamental right of the citizenry at large 
guaranteed by Article 17 read with Article 25 of 
the Constitution. None of the respondents has 
rebutted the above assertion of the petitioners. Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  11 
Accordingly, the instant petition is held to be  
maintainable.  
 
34. It may be mentioned here that the instant 
petition falls in the public interest litigation, 
which is not adversarial but inquisitorial in 
nature. In the cases of Watan Party v. Federation 
of Pakistan  (PLD 2011 SC 997) and All Pakistan 
Newspapers Society v. Federation of Pakistan  
(PLD 2012 SC 1) referred to by Mr. Farogh 
Naseem, ASC, this Court has held that it has the 
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon a case if it falls 
within the ambit of inquisitorial proceedings. It is 
also well settled  that while entertaining a direct 
petition under Article 184(3), this Court has 
ample power to examine the varies of laws, rules 
or regulations. Reference in this regard has been 
made to the cases of Wukala Mahaz Barai 
Tahafaz Dastoor v. Federation of Paki stan (PLD 
1988 SC 1263), Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1999 SC 57), Jalal 
Mehmood Shah v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 
1999 SC 395), Liaquat Hussain v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 1999 SC 504), Dr. Mobashir 
Hassan v. Federation of  Pakistan  (PLD 2010 SC 
265) and Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salaam v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2006 SC 602).”  
 
Reference in this behalf may also be made to the judgment of this 
Court reported as Mubasher Lucman v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others  (PLD 2011 SC 7 75). Thus, in the light of the law laid down in 
the aforesaid cases, i t is clear that this Court , under Article 184(3) of 
the Constitution , not only has the jurisdiction to pass appropriate 
orders in the cases involving questions of public importance with 
reference to enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  12 
Constitution but is also empowered to ensure fulfillment of the 
command of the Constitution of holding elections honestly, justly, 
fairly and in accordance with law . Hence , these petitions  are held to be 
maintainable and the grievances raised therein are justic eable by this 
Court in the present proceedings . The objection raised by Dr. Farogh 
Naseem, learned ASC appears to be misconceived and the judgments 
relied upon by him irrelevant in th e facts and circumstances of the 
case. 
16.  We have considered the submissions of the learned 
counsel for the parties  on merits  and have also gone through the 
material placed before us, and  also the law relied upon by them.   
17.  It is the command of the C onstitution under Article 218(3) 
that the Election Commission of Pakistan is charged with the duty to 
ensure free, fair and just elections in the country, be it a general 
election or bye -election. Whereas, u nder Article 219 of the 
Constitution , the Electio n Commission of Pakistan is als o commanded  
to revise the electoral list annually, object of which is none else , 
except that free and fair elections are held.     
18.   Before dilating upon the laws on the subject , we consider it 
appropriate to reproduce her ein below the number of constituencies of 
the National Assembl y and the Provincial Assemb ly of Karachi Division , 
as per the  gazette of Pakistan , June, 2002 , from where electors are 
required to choose their representatives as per the mandate of the 
Constitu tion:- 
KARACHI DIVISION  
No. and Name of NA 
Constituencies  NA 239 Karachi -I to NA -258 
Karachi -XX (20 Seats ) 
 
No. and Name of PA 
Constituencies  PS-89 Karachi -I to PS -130 
Karachi -XLII ( 42 Seats ) Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  13 
 
It is equally important to note that following number of vot ers in 
Karachi  have been brought on final Electoral Roll , 2012: - 
 
Name of 
District  Male  Female  Eunuch  Total  
Karachi Central  897443  712916  5 1610364  
Karachi East  1129217  901466  6 2030689  
Karachi South  603258  464342  3 1067603  
Karachi West  856085  560314  12 1416411  
Malir 426562  300314  5 726881  
Total  3912565  2939352  31 6851948  
 
19.  The Election Commission of Pakistan filed a reply vide CMA 
No.4654/2012, wherein it h as admitted that the process of revision of 
Electoral List pertains to the month of April -May, 2011. Extract from 
the reply is reproduced herein below: -  
 
“8. Above -mentioned reasons enforced ECP and 
NADRA to align their databases with respect to 
addresses according to New Census Blocks. For 
this purpose, a Pr oforma was devised to capture 
and l ink current location of families with newly 
created Census Blocks. These Pr oforma s were 
filled by enumerators during Housing Census – 
2011 conducted in April -May 2011 countrywide.”  
 
20.  The grievance raised primarily with reference to Karachi 
through the instant Constitution Petitions must necessarily be 
examined  in the above backdrop. It is the case of the Election 
Commission of Pakistan that door-to-door verification in Karachi has in 
fact been effected in respect of approximately 82% of the population. 
This fact is vehemently disputed by the learned counsel for the Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  14 
petitioners , who have contended that such door -to-door verification 
was not carried out in Karachi, which fact is obvious from the 
discrepancies and flaws identified by them by way of example s 
including the rather strange and physically impo ssible situation of over 
600 voters having been registered, as residents of a house measuring 
120 Sq. Yards.  
21.  The primary basis for the Electoral List of the Housing 
Census carried out in April -May 2011 . Even after the preparation of the 
Final Electoral Roll , the necessity of a further door-to-door verification 
was conceded by the Election Commission in para 23 of the above -said 
CMA, which is reproduced as follows: - 
  
“23. Voters having different current and 
permanent address can be re -verified through 
subsequent door to door verification along with 
fresh CNIC registrations.”  
 
22.  It may be observed that Karachi has a peculiar 
background , which include s a serious law & order situation , detailed 
stock of the same has been taken by this Court in the case of Watan 
Party v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 997).  In this judgment 
categorical directions were made for delimitation of the constituencies 
of Karachi  in the following terms: - 
 
“Further observe that to avoid political polarization, 
and to break the cycle of ethnic strife and turf war, 
boundaries of administrative units like police station, 
revenue estates, etc. ought to be altered so that the 
members of different communities  may live together 
in pea ce and harmony, instead of allowing various 
groups to claim that particular areas belong to them 
and declaring certain areas as NO GO Areas under 
their fearful influence. Subsequent thereto, on similar Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  15 
considerations, in view of relevant laws, delimitation  of 
different constituencies  has also to be undertaken with 
the same object and purpose, particularly to make 
Karachi, which  is the h ub of economic and commercial 
activities and also the face of Pakistan, a peaceful city 
in the near future. The Election Co mmission of 
Pakistan may also initiate the process on its own in 
this behalf. ”  
 
We beli eve that so far , the above directions have not been 
implemented , therefore, Election Commission owe s an expl anation to 
this Court. Needless to observe that  the above di rections were made in 
the backdrop of the said case and was discussed at length. Another 
relevant portion from the said judgment is reproduced herein below : - 
“26. It is noteworthy that the law enforcing 
agencies have detected a torture cell during 
hearing of the case at Karachi and succeeded in 
getting video clips of the most heinous, 
gruesome, brutal, horrible and inhuman acts of 
the criminals, who are found cutting throats of 
men and drilling their bodies. But, now it is 
informed that more such cells have  been detected 
in different parts of Karachi.  
27. As far as the injured or wounded persons are 
concerned, they are countless in number in all the 
disturbed areas of Karachi where different political 
parties have got dominant population on the basis 
of the language being spoken by them. It may be 
noted that the objective of above -noted brutal 
and gruesome incidents is to terrorize the citizens 
of Karachi and keep the entire society a hostage. ” 
… … …  
“92. An identical situation was prevailing in 
Malaysia and  that Government with full Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  16 
commitment and sincerity had also collected illicit 
arms from the criminals. Similarly, this task can 
be completed in our country as well; if there is 
honest commitment on the part of the law 
enforcing agencies but in the instant  case without 
depoliticizing the police, positive result apparently 
seems to be an uphill task, however, to ensure 
peace in Karachi, certain steps will have to be 
taken. The law enforcing agencies will have to be 
de-politicized as well as for recovery of i llicit arms 
effective measures will have to be taken under a 
proper programme to be launched by the 
Government. As far as the question of presence of 
2.5 million aliens in Karachi is concerned, it is 
more alarming compared to the activities of the 
criminal s involved in heinous crimes, like target 
killing, etc. This aspect of the case would reveal 
that the presence of such persons is not only a 
factor for increase in crime; but at the same time 
without proper registration, they are a burden on 
the national e conomy, inasmuch as their presence 
can give rise to so many other administrative 
problems, including obtaining of National Identity 
Cards by them. If they have succeeded in this 
venture and claim themselves to be citizens of 
Pakistan and have also succeede d in registering 
their names in the electoral list, it would be 
tantamount to depriving the actual electorate 
from choosing their representatives, inasmuch as 
due to their presence, areas have expanded 
considerably, which directly affects the 
delimitation of the constituencies meant for 
holding elections of the Provincial Assembly and 
the National Assembly , therefore, the Government 
should take immediate action against them in 
accordance with law, namely, the Foreigners Act. 
NADRA and the Police must undert ake a careful Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  17 
cleansing process of such people and NADRA must 
have separate records and computer files based 
on proper and cogent evidence. NADRA and police 
should co -operate in Karachi through an intensive 
drive to identify foreigners, block their NIC car ds 
after due process of law and special teams should 
be appointed and dedicated for this job by DG 
NADRAT and IGP so that this can be completed in 
the course of next one year or so. Then the law 
must take it own course in each case. This must 
be given high  priority. ” 
 
 
23.   The a pprehensions  of all the petition ers cannot be  brushed 
aside in view of the reasons (directions) quoted above. It is also to be 
noted that the above judgment is intact as it has not been challenged 
by filing review petition. Thus a concluded judgment, furnishes strong 
reasons to hold that in such a situation whe n there were NO GO Areas, 
in Karachi;  police has been politicized (as per statement of IGP , 30% 
to 40% of the Principal L aw Enforcing Agency,  has been politicized ); 
political parties, barring a few have militant groups ; life and property 
of the citizen is not protected;  etc., the process of preparing of 
Electoral Rolls or revising the same transparen tly was not likely , as 
alleged by the petitioners . Further more, i n a situation where life and 
property of the people is not protected, how electors would come 
forward to co -operate with the staff of election department for such 
purpose, and there is every likelihood of illegalities having  taken  place.  
24.   Viewed in the above persp ective, the discrepancies in the 
Electoral Roll of Karachi identified by the learned counsel for the 
Petitioners by way of example , examined in conjunction with the 
admitted position of the Election Commission that a door -to-door Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  18 
verification of the entire  residents of Karachi has not been carried out 
leads to the conclusion that the Electoral Rolls of Karachi  do not inspire 
confidence and the possibility that a significant number of residents of 
Karachi may have been disenfranchised  cannot be ignored . An 
accurate Electoral Roll is a sine quo non  for the holding of a free, fair 
and transparent election, which is not only the command of the 
Constitution but also a Fundamental Right of the citizens , which 
appears to have been compromised  qua the residents  of Karachi .  
25.  It may not be out of context to mention that this Court 
while deciding the case of Workers’ Party Pakistan  (supra ) has already 
highlighted the importance of preparation of the electoral list to ensure 
free and fair elections  and has held as u nder: -  
 
“67. Fair, free, honest and just elections are since 
qua non for strengthening of democracy. To 
achieve this goal, accurate preparation/revision of 
electoral roll is immediately required to be 
undertaken by the Election Commission through 
credibl e and independent agencies. In so doing, 
the convential  ways and means of merely 
depending upon NADRA alone or other similar 
bodies must be discontinued forthwith. 
Accordingly, we direct the Election Commission to 
undertake door -to-door checking of voters’  lists 
and complete the process of updating/revision of 
the electoral rolls by engaging Army and the 
Frontier Corps, if need. ……”   
 
26.   It may be noted that Article 219 of the Constitution, which 
is an enabling provision, contemplates an annual revision of Electoral 
Roll subject to law including the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and the Rules 
framed thereunder.  It is an admitted position that the matter of the Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  19 
revision of the Electoral Roll was communicated to this Court by 
Secretary , Election Commission . The  relevant portion of the order 
dated 4.7.2011 reads as under:  - 
 
“Mr. Ishtiaq Ahmed, Secretary Election Commission of 
Pakistan stated that: - 
(i) In view of the report of NADRA following 
categories of unverified voters have been 
removed from the database of NAD RA:- 
Category of unverified Voters  Voters 
Count  
Voters without any Identity Number  15,028,808  
Voters with Invalid CNIC  2,140,015  
Voters with Duplicate CNIC entries  2,491,090  
Voters with Duplicate MNIC entries  6,469,310  
Voters with MNIC not registered with 
NADRA  11,056,775  
Total unverified Voters:  37,185,998  
 
(ii) In the place of above removed voters, 36 
million voters have been entered into the 
database and verification of both the categories 
is to be carried out by visiting/approaching the 
house of each voter by the representative of the 
Election Commission door to door. This exercise 
shall commence from 18th of July, 2011 and is 
likely to be completed on 16th of August, 2011. 
He added that further procedure of 
publishing/displaying these lists shall be c arried 
out according to law and in this respect, a 
comprehensive plan has already been chalked 
out, copy of which has been placed on record. 
According to him, the whole procedure is likely 
to be completed by 16th of December, 2011 and 
thereafter the lists shall be handed over to 
NADRA for scanning and printing.”  
 
This process was undertaken in the month of May, 2011 but the final 
notification has been issued i n May, 2012. Thus, we have to refer to Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  20

In the case of National Insurance Company  v. Life Insurance 
Corporation  (AIR 1963 SC 1171) it has been held that t he word 
“annual” mu st be given its full meaning. By the word “annual” is 
meant something which is reckoned by the year. In the case of Prem 
Kevalram Shahani v. Government of Pakistan  (PLD 1989 Karachi 123) 
it has been held that a plain reading of Article 218 shows that its 
clauses (1) and (2) provide the constitution of the Commission and its 
composition, whereas clause (3) provides its duties, namely, that it 
shall be the duty of the Election Commission in relation to an election 
to organize and conduct the election and to m ake such arrangements 
as are necessary to ensure that the election is conducted honestly, 
justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are 
guarded against, whereas Article 219 lays down the duties of the 
Commission , namely, prepari ng electoral rolls for election to the 
Natio nal Assembly and the Provincial  Assemblies and revising such 
rolls annually, organizing and conducting election to the Senate or to 
fill casual vacancies in a House or a Provincial Assembly and 
appointing Electio n Tribunals.  
 There can be no escape from the fact that a free, fair, just and 
transparent election is the very heart of our democratic system, as 
envisaged by the Constitution.  Such elections must not only be held in Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  23 
a fair, just and honest manner but al so appear to be so; in order to 
inspire the confidence of the electorate. The provisions of Article 219 
of the Constitution and the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and rules framed 
thereunder must necessarily be interpreted in manner so as to achieve 
the said ob ject. Consequently, Election Commission must fulfill its 
obligation cast upon it by Article 21 8 of the Constitution of ensuring 
the holding free, fair and transparent elections and to achieve such 
purpose seek assistance, if necessary from the Executive Au thorities in 
the Federation in this behalf which are obliged to render such 
assistance by virtue of Article 220 of the Constitution.  
27.   There is no denial of the fact that free, fair, honest, 
transparent and just election  is demand of the day as the 
Parliamentary system of the country is strengthening day by day. 
Therefore, all eligible citizens have a fundamental right of franchise , 
which must be protected by issuing appropriate directions.  
28.  In the above circumstances, it is clear that the Elector al 
Rolls of the city of Ka rachi are required to be revised by the Election 
Commission in exercise of powers conferred upon it under  Article 219 
of the Constitution read with Electoral Roll s Act, 1974 to achieve the 
object, which is to be ensured by the Com mission in terms of Article 
218 of the Constitution. Thus, the Election Commission of Pakistan is 
directed to carry out proper and complete door -to-door verification in 
Karachi so as to en sure that no voter is disenfranchised  or dislocated 
and all other discrepancies  are rectified as early as possible.  
 In view of the peculiar security situation in Karachi highlighted 
hereinabove such verification must be carried out by the Election 
Commission with the help and assistance of Pakistan Army and the FC.  05.12.2012Const. P No.31 -2011, etc.  24 
29.   For the foregoing reasons , Constitution Petitions No.45 of 
2007 and 111 & 123 of 2012 are disposed of in the above terms.
