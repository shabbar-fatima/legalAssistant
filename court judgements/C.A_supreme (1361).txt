ORDER  
Qazi Faez Isa, J . This petition for leave to appeal assails the order dated 6 
September 2022 passed in Customs Reference No. 21 -P/2022, which had 
upheld the order dated 25 January 2022 passed by the Customs Appellate 
Tribunal, Peshawar Bench, which had in turn upheld the order -in-original 
dated 13 August 2021 passed by the Additional Collector, Collectorate of 
Customs (Adjudication) Islamabad, Camp Office Peshawar. Therefore, three 
concurrent decisions have been assailed  herein.  
 
2. The petition has been belatedly filed with a delay of 11 days. Through 
CMA No. 10322/2022 the said delay is sought to be condoned on the 
ground that formalities needed to be fulfilled  and ‘ permission of high -ups for 
filing the petition ’ was sought, which was awaited.  
 
3. We enquired from the learned counsel about the amount of revenue 
involved and were told that it was 2.8 million rupees, whereas on the 
petition court -fee of 250 rupees was payable. We next enquired whether the 
person responsi ble for the belated filing was proceeded against and were 
informed that this was not done.  C. P. No. 4145/2022

4. Surprisingly, the petitioners elected to jeopardise a claim of 2.8 
million rupees merely to save court -fee of 250 rupees. If it was 
subsequently decided against the filing of the petition it could have been 
withdrawn. The petitioners lost sight of the larger goal by jeopardising 2.8 
million rupees to save 250 rupees.  
 
5. If decisions are assailed they should be done within the prescribed 
period, and it should not be assumed that delay would be condoned when 
there is no valid reason to condone the same, as in the instant case. 
Therefore, the said application is dismissed and, consequently, the petition 
for leave to appeal is also dismissed.  
 
6. A copy of this order be sent to the Chairman, Federal Board of 
Revenue.
