  EJAZ AFZAL KHAN, J. - The issue raised in this case is that 
the Bahria Town has encroached upon a great deal of forest land. 
Demarcation has been conducted at various levels but no 
conclusive finding could be handed down . Mr. Ali Zafar, l earned ASC 
appearing on behalf of the Bahria Town contended that 
demarcation of the forest land and the land in contiguity was 
conducted in 2007 ; that the  said demarcation proceedings were 
scrutinized by the NAB Authorities and Provincial Ombudsman during 
the proceedings of Suo M otu Case No. 03 of 2009 and found to be 
correct and that on the basis of the said proceedings an area -
measuring 1170 kanals of the forest was found to have been 
encroached by Bahria Town and an area measuring 765 of the 
Bahria Town was fou nd to have been encroached by the Forest 
Department and that the area thus found to have been 
encroached was not only accepted by one another but mutations 
witnessing exchange of the said areas were also entered and 
attested. The learned ASC went on to arg ue that the confusion in this 
case has arisen on account of wrong entries in the revenue papers 
showing that total area of Takht  Pari as 2210 acres which in fact is 
1741 acres and that if this position is accepted there could be no 
dispute about encroachme nt especially after its settlement resulting 
in the exchange of the property and attestation of mutations as 
mentioned above. The learned ASC next contended that if the field 
map of 1956 -57 and measurements therein are considered, no area 
can be said to ha ve been encroached by the Bahria  Town. He lastly 
argued that once the matter was set at rest on the attestation of 
mutations and disposal of SMC. No. 3 of 2009 on 05.06.2013, CMA. CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 5
No. 3854 of 2014 raising the same issue could not have been 
entertained to r evive an issue which was past and closed.  
2.  Syed Zahid Hussain Bukhari, another learned ASC for 
Bahria Town also reiterated the arguments of Mr. Ali Zafar learned 
ASC for the Bahria Town.  
3.  Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, learned Sr. ASC appearing on behalf of 
the investors reiterated the arguments as were addressed by Mr. Ali 
Zafar . He, however, dwelt at length while highlighting the bias of 
Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary, the former Chief Justice of Pakistan 
against Malik Riaz, Chief Executive of  the Bahria Town beca use of the 
well-known scandal of Arsalan Iftikhar, a son of the then Chief 
Justice. The learned Sr. ASC next contended that once the matter 
was concluded vide order dated 5.6.2013 in SMC. No. 03 of 2009, it 
could not have been reopened; that any one -sided demarcation 
conducted pursuant to the order dated 18.6.2013 passed in the 
chamber s of this Court  cannot be acted upon firstly because no 
notice of such proceedings was given to the Bahria Town and 
secondly because it was not conducted on the spot. The lear ned Sr. 
ASC by referring to the order dated 2nd and 3rd November, 2015 
passed in Crl. O. P. No. 110 of 2014 by a three -member bench of this 
Court contended that where this Court itself held that as for Takht 
Pari Forest, there needs to be a coordinated eff ort between the 
Forest Department, Revenue Department and Survey of Pakistan , 
any demarcation report without the coordination of the three 
departments cannot be construed to have been conducted in  
compliance with the above -mentioned order  of this Court . Whether 
the total area of Takht Pari , the learned Sr. ASC maintained,  is 2210 
acres or 1741 acres is a question to be determined by the civil court, CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 6
therefore, this Court cannot determine such question  in a 
proceeding of this natu re. The learned Sr. ASC cont ended  that 
where the Bahria Town having settled the dispute raised 
superstructure on the property and spent a great deal of money on 
its development, it would be unjust to oust it therefrom especially 
when it is willing to pay the compensation for the prop erty.  The 
learned Sr. ASC next contended that where report dated 20.12.2006 
was accepted by the parties and no appeal was filed thereagasint , 
it attained finality. The learned Sr. ASC further contended that where 
land of reserved forest was utilized by DHA and many other housing 
societies without any caveat, Bahria Town could not be treated 
differently. He lastly argued that where human rights  cases are dealt 
with by the Human Rights Cell, there was absolutely no occasion to 
give different treatment to H.R.C No. 4729 -P of 2011.  
4.  Mr. Razzaq A. Mirza, the learned Addl. A. G. Punjab by 
referring to the field map of the years 1885 and 1956 and the record 
of rights of the year 1956 contended that the total area of Takht  Pari 
is 2210 acres and that if the demarcation report dated 15.4.2017 
conducted on the basis of the aforesaid figures is considered, the 
area of 684 acres has rightly been found t o have been encroached 
by the Bahria Town and that the encroachment thus worked out 
appears to be perfectly correct on all accounts. This report, the 
learned Addl. A. G. maintained is further strengthened by the entries 
made in the Punjab District Gazettee r Volume XXVIII, published in 
1907, working plan of scrub forest of Rawalpindi, West Forest Division 
for the period 1933 -34 to 1952 -53, working plan of 1966 -67 to 1975 -76 
and working plan of  1989 -90 to 2019 -20 showing  that the total area of 
Rukh Takht  Pari is 2210 acres. The learned Addl. A. G. lastly CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 7
contended that when it is unshakably established on the record that 
the total area of Rukh Takht  Pari is 2210 acres, one or any number of 
reports based on the assumptions that its total area is 1741 acres 
cann ot hold the field notwithstanding such reports were approved 
by the then Chief Minister of the Province.  
5.  Mr. Malik Muhammad Shafi, petitioner in H.R.C. No. 4729 -
P of 2011 contended that a huge property of the Forest Department 
has been grabbed by the Bahria Town by tampering with the record 
in collusion with the officials of the Forest Department and the 
revenue hierarchy; that the Chief Minister could have nipped the evil 
in the bud but he too having been obliged by the land grabbers 
illegally approve d the demarcation report and the exchange 
effected pursuant thereto. He also referred to the mutations attested 
in favour of the front man of the Chief Minister and then in favour of 
his family members and that the litigation has been going on at 
various l evels including this Court for more than a decade but it does 
not admit of any end due to the dilatory tactics of the counsel 
representing Bahria Town notwithstanding it is too evident to be 
disputed that the area of Rakh Takht Pari is 2210 acres. This asp ect 
has also been highlighted in Crl. O. P. No. 110 of 2014 filed by Dr. 
Muhammad Shafiq -ur-Rehman. He also accused the Provincial 
Bureaucracy and the then Chief Minister to have colluded with the  
Bahria Town in manoeuvring the approval of the demarcation 
reports based on erroneous assumption.  
6.  We h ave carefully gone through the record and 
considered the submissions of the learned Sr. ASC and ASCs for the 
Bahria  Town, the applicants appearing in person and the learned 
Addl. A. G. Punjab.  CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 8
7.  The first and foremost point to be considered in this case 
is as to what is the total area of the forest land known as  Rukh  Takht  
Pari and what are the documents establishing it. The best evidence 
to prove the area is the record of rights and field maps prepared 
during the settlement of the area in 1956 -57. According to the record 
of rights the total area of Rukh Takht  Pari is 17678 kanals and 17 
marlas. This area when converted into acres comes to approximately 
2210 acres. This record having been prepared during the  settlement 
of 1956 -57 is blessed with much greater presumption of truth. The 
raison detre behind such presumption is that the settlement is always 
invariably carried in the presence of village proprietary body and 
during such course every nook and corner of the land is measured 
and demarcated afresh. Therefore, much stronger evidence is 
required to rebut this presumption. Nothing has been brought on the 
record to dispute the entries appearing in the record of rights 
prepared during the settlement of 1956 -57. The learned Sr. ASC and 
ASCs for the Bahria Town during the course of their arguments and 
even in their written arguments submitted in the Court placed 
reliance on the same documents.  
8.  Another independent, impartial and above -board 
evidence appearin g in the form of the Punjab District Gazetteer 
Volume XXVIII, published in 1907, working plan of scrub forest of 
Rawalpindi West Forest Division for the period 1933 -34 to 1952 -53, 
revised working plan of 1959 -60 to 1963 -64, 1966 -67 to 1975 -76 and 
working p lan of 1988 -89 to 2019 -2020 amply and overwhelmingly 
prove s that the total area of Takht Pari forest is 2210 acres. When an 
undisputed evidence of this type has been available we fail to 
understand what mode of calculation reduced the area of 2210 to CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 9
1741 acres. Yes, the then Chief Minister approved the reports of 
demarcation carried out earlier but no sanctity could be attached 
to such reports when the officials demarcating the land based their 
finding on the assumption that the total area of Rukh Takht Pa ri is 
1741 acres which is erroneous on the face of it. What led the then 
Chief Minister to be so benign and benevolent to the encroachers of 
such a huge area of the forest land  has been explained by the 
applicant in C.M.A No. 4729 by alleging  that the then  Chief Minister 
was obliged by the Bahria Town by transferring 270 kanals of land 
vide mutation no.966 sanctioned on 22.6.2005 to Ch. Munir Ahmed , 
the alleged front man of the then Chief Minister , who in turn 
transferred 200 kanals to Ch. Salik, Ch. Rasikh  Ali and Mst. Kharia 
Shujaat Hussain vide mutations No. 995 and 996 sanctioned on 
10.04.2008.  This is what we have been told about the Chief Minister . 
But what about the officialdom of the revenue hierarchy and the 
Forest Department whose watchful presence  did little to guard 
against the intrusion of  the Bahria Town and encroachment over a 
huge area of the forest land?  It appears that they too being in 
league with the intruders let them do what they wanted to do.  
Thousands of trees were cut with the collusi on of the officials of the 
Forest Department but what is bizarre and baffling is that they did not 
even wrinkle their noses, nor did they utter a syllable of disapproval. 
What was this due to? Was it the heat of money which let their 
responsibility pass of f in vapours or was there grease in their palms 
which let the intruders slip and spiral out of their hands despite 
violating the law ? It is horribly depressing to note that in the age of 
advanced technology even an encroachment of inches gets 
detected, but  that of hundreds of  acres goes  unnoticed. In a CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 10
situation of this type where the officialdom in the revenue hierarchy 
and the Forest Department acted hand in glove with the 
encroachers, the Supreme Court has to step in else everything, every 
government lan d and every government building shall be gobbled 
by the grabbers. We have been told that Mr. Malik Riaz is a great 
philanthropist providing medicines to the ailing poor and food to the 
needy. But in the given background his case is no better than the 
one i llustrated in the phrase, “rob Peter to pay Paul”. If he deserves 
fame and acclaim for paying Paul he would certainly deserve 
shame and blame for robbing Peter. He, thus, cannot avoid the 
consequences of his acts done in contravention of law or off set 
them with his charitable acts.         
9.  Much hue and cry has been raised by the learned Sr. 
ASC and ASCs for Bahria Town by contending that once reports of 
demarcation have been accepted, a settlement pursuant thereto 
has been arrived at, the area encroached upon by either of the 
sides has been adjusted through exchange, mutations in this behalf 
have been sanctioned and S.M.C No. 3 of 2009 has been disposed 
of, C.M.A No. 3854 of 2014 raising the same issue could not have 
been entertained to revive an issue set at rest once and for all. This 
hue and cry to say the least is without any legal or moral justification 
when demarcations forming basis of such reports were not 
conducted in accordance with undisputed entries of the r ecord of 
rights for the year 1956 -57. Similarly , the settlements arrived at 
between the Forest Department and the Bahria Town culminating an 
exchange and even the order dated 05.06.2013 of this Court cannot 
be vested with any sanctity and even finality whe n the entire 
proceeding s from the inception to the end were based on CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 11
misrepresentation, erroneous assumption about the area and non -
reading of the record in its correct perspective. Such proceedings 
even otherwise cannot be vested with any sanctity when th e 
revenue staff and officials of the Forest Department being more 
royalist than the monarch defended the interest of Bahria Town with 
much greater tenacity than the Bahria Town did itself. This situation 
has been more picture sque  portrayed in one of the verses of Saghir 
Siddiqi which reads as under:   
ﺑﮯ وﺟہ ﺗو ﻧﮩﯾں ﮨﯾں ﭼﻣن ﮐﯽ ﺗﺑﺎﮨﯾﺎں  
ﮐﭼﮭ ﺑﺎﻏﺑﺎں ﮨﯾں ﺑرق و ﺷرر ﺳﮯ ﻣﻠﮯ ﮨوﺋﮯ  
Any order passed on the basis of such reports cannot prevent us from 
reading the revenue record in its correct pe rspective drawing 
conclusions accordingly  and reopening the matter thus disposed of . 
The objection of the learned Sr. ASC and ASCs for the Bahria Town 
thus being misconceived has to be turned down if not scoffed at. 
The argument whether the total area of T akht Pari is 2210 acres or 
1741 acres is a question to be dealt with by the civil court and that 
this Court cannot deal with such a question in a proceeding of this 
type is shorn of force when the entries in the record of rights of 1956 -
57, field maps of 1 886 and  1956 -57, Punjab District Gazetteer Volume 
XXVIII, published in 1907, working plan of scrub forest of Rawalpindi, 
West Forest Division for the period 1933 -34 to 1952 -53, working plan of  
1966 -67 to 1975 -76 and working plan of  1989 -90 to 2019 -20 clearly 
and unmistakably show that total area of T akht Pari is 2210 acres . It, 
therefore,  is not a question to be referred to the civil court when the 
record of rights of 1956 -57 has also been relied upon by the Bahria 
Town itself in the written arguments submitted by the learned ASC 
therefor  without questioning the sanctity of the entries before any 
legal forum and even in the suit instituted before the civil court.       CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 12
10.  The argument that where the Bahria Town having settled 
the dispute raised supers tructure on the property and spent a great 
deal of money on its development, it would be unjust to oust them 
therefrom especially when they are willing to pay the compensation 
for the property is vacuous both legally and morally when they knew 
all along th at the property they took possession of and raised 
superstructure thereon was Forest Land. The argument that where 
land of reserved forest was utilized by DHA and many other housing 
societies without any caveat, Bahria Town could not be treated 
differently  is legally incorrect as one or any number of wrongs cannot 
justify yet another. However, if at all any forest land has been utilized 
by DHA or any other society in violation of the provisions of law, we 
would request the honourable Chief Justice of Pakist an to take Suo 
Moto Notice of this fact so that all those who are found to be similarly 
placed be treated similarly. The argument that where human rights 
cases are dealt with by the Human Rights Cell, there was absolutely 
no occasion to give different trea tment to H.R.C No. 4729 -P of 2011 is 
devoid of force as many human right cases were listed in the Court 
and decided accordingly.  The argument that that any one -sided 
demarcation conducted pursuant to the order dated 18.6.2013 
passed in the chambers of this  Court cannot be acted upon firstly 
because no notice of such proceedings was given to the Bahria 
Town and secondly because it was not conducted on the spot in  
accordance with the order dated 2nd and 3rd November 2015 
passed in Crl. O. P. No. 110 of 2014 is not without substance when a 
three -member bench of this Court on 2nd and 3rd November 2015 
observed by holding that as f or Takht Pari forest, there needs to be a CIVIL MISC. APPLICAT ION NO. 3854 OF 2014  IN S.M.C.NO.3 OF 200 9 13
coordinated effort between the Forest Department, Revenue 
Department and Survey of Pakistan .     
11.  As a sequel to what has been discussed and highlighted 
above, we declare that the area of Takht Pari is 2210 acres; that 
exchange of land purportedly encroached by Bahria Town and the 
Forest Department and attestation of mutations in this behalf  being 
based on erroneous assumption about the area is against law and 
the record and as such of no effect and the order passed in 
S.M.C.No. 3 of 2009 is recalled and direct the Forest Department, 
Revenue Department and Survey of Pakistan to conduct a fres h 
demarcation after giving notices to Forest Department and Bahria 
Town and submit their report within one month before the 
implementation bench of this Court. We, therefore, request the 
Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan to constitute  an implementation 
bench in this regard. However, if any third -party interest has been 
created over the Forest Land what to do therewith and how to deal 
therewith shall be decided by the implementation bench.  The NAB is 
directed to investigate the case and file references ag ainst all those 
who are found responsible for committing, aiding and abetting the 
crime at any level or in any form.  
12.  For the reasons discussed above, Civil Review Petitions 
No. 155 to 156 of 2015, 245 of 2013 and 473 of 2015 are dismissed. 
Criminal Or iginal Petition No. 110 of 2014, Human Right Case No.
