    O RDE R  
 Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Munir Hussain, 
petitioner was indicted alongside his  brother Riaz Ahmed , since 
acquitted, for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Abdul Razzaq, deceased, 
44, at  9:30 a.m. on 3.11.2008 within the precincts of Police Station  
City Mianwali ; deceased was on a motorbike followed by the 
witnesses when the accused confronted  him near saw machine of 
Haji Muhammad Din. Petitioner is attributed consecutive shots; 
autopsy report confirmed five entry wounds with their 
corresponding exits besides two lacerated wounds  of substantial 
dimensions on deceased’s organ of generation . Prio r to the 
occurrence, the local police had raided the accused  and as per 
crime report the accused suspected the deceased behind the 
episode , cited as motive for the crime . Trial culminated into JAIL PETITION NO.461 /2013 AND  
CRIMINAL PETITION NO .1364 -L/2013  
  2
conviction with penalty of death . Complainant questioned  
co-accused ’s acquittal while the convict disputed his conv iction; 
the High Court dismissed  appeal against acquittal while   altered  
the penalty of death  into imprisonment for life vide impugned 
judgment dated 7.10.2013, vires whereof are being assailed  by the 
both sides . It is argued that  given the deceased’s position, riding 
on a motorbike, confronted by the petitioner , as per prosecution’ s 
own case, from his right flank , there was no occasion for the 
deceased to receive five shots  on his back; injuries on organ of 
generation  have been referred to canvass  an hypothesis, 
incompatible with the crime report  besides prosecution’s failure 
qua the co -accused.  Learned counsel for the complainant contends 
that without active participation/support of Riaz Ahmed 
respondent/co -accused, it was simply not possible for the convict 
to gun down the deceased and, thus, there was no occasion for the 
courts below to issue him a clean chit; he further argued that both 
the accused equally shared the motive . Magnitude of viol ence has 
been highlighted to argue that penalty of death  is an appropriate 
wage in circumstances.  Leave  is granted to the both sides to 
examine the above contentions.
