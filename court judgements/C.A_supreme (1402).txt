2. The learned counsel representing DHA and Bahria Town , state that 
Bahria Town  had transferred the land that it had acquired from the defunct  
Revenue Employees Cooperative  Housing Society (‘Society ’) to DHA by 
enter ing into a Trade Off Agreement  dated  29 August 2007 , which was 
executed with (1) Petro  Trade (Pvt.) Ltd. a subsidiary of Habib Rafique (Pvt .) 
Ltd., throu gh its Chief Executive Mr. Zahid Rafique , (2) Bahira Town , 
through its Chief Executive  Malik Riaz Hussain , and (3) Defence Housing 
Authority ,  , through its Administrator Mr. Iftikhar Ali Khan . We are further 
informed that earlier an Agreement  dated 17 Feb ruary 2005  was entered 
into between Bahira Town and Col. (R) Abdulla h Siddique, Administrator  of 
the Societ y and the land of the Society was transferred to B ahria Town . The 
Agreement  is on the letterhead of Bahria Town and provide s that land shall 
be trans ferred to the members of the Society within a period of five years. 
However, well before the expiry of the said five years period Bahria Town is 
stated to have handed over the said land to DHA through the Trade Off 
Agreement .  
 
 
 
3. Learned Advocate -Genera l, Punjab state s that the term of the 
Administrator of the Society had expired when he had entered into 
Agreement  dated 17 February 2005 , and that he was not authorized to 
enter into the said Agreement . He further states that the then Chief 
Minister of Punjab, namely , Mr. Pervaiz El ahi, had no power to exempt the 
application of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 and merger of the Society 
with Bahria Town and that the Minister of Cooperative s in writing had 
oppose d it but his objections were not even attend ed to, and Mr. Pervaiz 
Elahi granted his approval .    
 
4.  We found it difficult to understand the nature of the said two 
Agreement s and whether the same were legally executed also needs to be 
addressed by the parties thereto. It is also not clear what the  parties 
thereto got pursuant to the said two Agreements and the  monies, if any  Civil Petitions No.4889, 4890, 4907, 4945 & 5008/2018

paid/received. Therefore, the said part ies are directed to file concise 
statement s attending to th ese queries with site plan s, marking out the land 
with attached Google map whe re the land should also be marked. During 
the hearing the question also arose, whether public disclosure was made of 
the two Agreements.  
 
5. We need to understand the Government of Pakistan’s and the 
Provinces ’ policies, if any, with regard to the followi ng: 
(1) The advantages to the province/country accru ing from  
conversion of agricultural land for residential/commercial use .  
 
(2) Whether those invest ing in building societies and not utilizing 
that land assist in generating economic activity, employment  
and taxable income?  
 
(3) Whether land conversions decrease the availability of 
agricultur al land, and if so, whether it adversely impacts food 
security, and increases dependency on food imports?  
 
(4)  Who is legally empowered to grant approvals for conve rting 
land use and for such projects?  
 
(5) Whether  there is any provision for providing land to those with 
lower income s, and the poor by providing smaller plots of a few 
or even  a single marla? 
 
 (6) Does not representative government require that decis ions 
pertaining to such public matters are brought before the  
peoples  elected representatives?  
 
(7) Does such massive land use conversions contribute to   
environmental degradation, pollution and climate change ?  
  
(8) The applicability of the Transfer of  Property Act, 1882, the 
Registration Act and Stamp Duty Act ? 
 
Therefore, notices are issued to the Government of Pakistan and the 
Islamabad Capital Territory through the Attorney -General for Pakistan and 
to the Provinces through their respective Advocate -General s, and they are 
directed to submit their replies to the aforesaid queries  and may also 
provide any other relevant information.

anything , then there are those who had paid for the land and did get land 
or receive money and then there are those who had paid for the land but 
were not satisfied with what was offered to them  and did not receive either 
land or money.  Respective details in this regard should be filed by Bahria

the petitioners and others.
