  On 24.06.2013, the learned Deputy Attorney General filed a 
statement in Court on behalf of the Fede ration. After going through the 
same, we had asked the learned Attorney General to flesh out the same by 
providing particulars as to what steps are envisioned by the Federation to 
bring the persons guilty of acts under Article 6 of the Constitution, to jus tice. 
On behalf of the Federation, pursuant to our order dated 24.06.2013,  CMA 
No.4112 of 2013 has been filed, giving outlines of the process envisioned by 
the Federation, which reads as under: - 
“1. The Prime Minister has directed the Secretary Interior to  
forthwith direct the Director General FIA to constitute a special 
investigative team of senior officers to commence an inquiry and 
investigation in relation to the acts of General (R) Parvez 
Musharraf of 3rd November, 2007 that may amount to high 
treason under Article 6 of the Constitution and to finalize as 
expeditiously as possible the statement of case to be put up by 
the Federal Government before the Special Court to be 
constituted under the Criminal Law Amendment (Special 
Courts) Act, 1976.  
2. The La w entrusts the investigation of the offence of high 
treason to the FIA under entry No.14 of the Schedule of the FIA 
Act, 1974 read with Section 3(a) and 6 thereof. However, in order 
to ensure expeditious completion of the inquiry and 
investigation, the Pri me Minister is also considering the 
constitution of a Commission to oversee and monitor the 
progress of the proceedings.  
3. On the completion of the investigation, the Federal 
Government shall file the requisite complaint under Section 5 of the 
Criminal L aw Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1976 and take steps 
to constitute the Special Court in accordance with Section 4 of the 
said Act for the trial of the offence.”  
2.  Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, after going 
through the outlines of proce ss envisioned by the Federation, while 
expressing their satisfaction, stated that the Federal Government should be 
asked to give a timeframe for completion of the investigation and the date 
when the Special Court in terms of Criminal Law Amendment (Special  
Courts) Act, 1976 will be constituted. Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC appearing for 
the petitioner in Constitution Petition No. 14 of 2013 stated that since the 
Federation has decided to initiate investigation and then to file a complaint, 
the respondent should be taken into custody and the case be registered 
against him under Article 6 of the Constitution.  CP-2255/2010, etc.  3
3.  Raja Muhammad Ibrahim Satti, Sr. ASC has filed CMA No. 4128 
of 2013 on behalf of the respondent and stated that after the statement made 
by the learned A ttorney General in Court that due process will be followed 
and the respondent will be provided fair trial, he has no reservation on the 
statement filed in Court today on behalf of the Federation. He has, however, 
contended that in the earlier statement fil ed in Court by the learned Attorney 
General (reproduced in our order of 24.06.2013) the reference made to the 
case of Sindh High Court Bar Association, ( PLD 2009 SC  879) may prejudice 
his client at the trial before the Special Court. We have gone through t he 
earlier statement, and have also heard the learned Attorney General on this 
score. The anxiety expressed by Mr. Satti is misplaced because the Special 
Court will be the trial Court and will ensure due process of law to the 
respondent, and will decide th e case in accordance with the established 
precept s and principles of a fair trial as per law.  
4.  The pendency of these proceedings  does not in any manner, 
effect the actions of the Government  contemplated in the statement 
reproduced above.  
Adjourned to 28.06.2013  for further hearing.
