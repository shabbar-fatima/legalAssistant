JUDGMENT  
  AMIR HANI MUSLIM, J.  – The relevant facts for the 
purpose of disposal of these Appeals are that the Appellants were posted in 
different Platoons of Frontier Constabulary which were deployed in different 
areas of F.R Peshawar and F.R Kohat. They were dismissed from service on 
the allegations of insubordination and cowardice. The Respondents filed 
Appeals before the Federal Service T ribunal, Islamabad, which were 
allowed, by various judgments passed on different  dates and they were 
reinstated in service with direction to the Appellants to hold de novo 
inqui ries against them and conclude the same within four months, providing 
them full  opportunity of hearing.   
 
2.  After receipt of the judgments of the Federal Service Tribunal, 
the Appellants without formally reinstating the  Respondents , conducted de 
novo inquiry in the light of directions of the Tribunal and dismissed all the 
Responde nts from service. The record shows that a second de novo inquiry 
upon the direction of the Tribunal was conducted against some of the 
Respondents, but they too were dismissed. The record further reveals that 
even 5th de novo inquiry was conducted  against s ome of the Respondents,  
who were dismissed after such inquiries .  
 
3.  Feeling aggrieved, this time the Respondents approached the 
High Court, pleading therein that the orders of dismissal  from service were 
illegal and passed without affording them opportu nity of hearing. The 
learned High Court allowed all the Writ Petitions  holding as under: - 
“In case in hand, no doubt serious allegation were levelled 
against the Petitioners but the standard of proof as well as C.As.No.1122/13 etc.  3 
the procedure adopted by the respondents, whi ch is 
otherwise too noticeable, from the comments filed by 
respondents before this Court, without proper 
documentation and proper and elaborate answer to the 
objections raised by the petitioners in their writ petitions 
give no other reference but to hold t hat dismissal orders 
resulted into miscarriage of justice. The remand of these 
writ petitions would serve no good purpose too as 
respondents have already conducted a number of inquiries 
against the petitioners and another de novo inquiries would 
do nothing  except to increase more agonies while 
petitioners have already suffered for more than four years 
which was a sufficient punishment for any lapses on their 
part (if any).  
30. This while allowing these writ petitions, we set 
aside the impugned orders of dis missal of the petitioners 
from their services and order their re -instatement into 
service from the date when they were dismissed with all 
consequential benefit of the posts from the said date except 
the salary as there is no proof that petitioners remained  
jobless for the whole duration of their dismissal.   
 
4.  The Appellants challenged the judgments of the learned High 
Court before this Court and leave was granted in these appeals, inter alia , to 
consider whether the Respondents are Civil Servants. Hence  these Appeals.  
 
5.  The learned Counsel for the Appellants has contended that the 
Respondents are Civil Servants and the jurisdiction of High Court was 
barred under Article 212 of the Constitution. He submitted that once the 
Respondents had obtained reli ef from the Federal Service Tribunal, they 
could not have approach ed the High Court for the same relief. He next 
contended that the findings of the High Court were erroneous on the point 
that the Appellants had failed to comply with the provisions of Rule 18 of 
the North West Frontier Constabulary Rules, 1958. In support of his C.As.No.1122/13 etc.  4 
submissions, he has relied upon the case of I.G Frontier Corps and others vs 
Ghulam Hussain  (2004 SCMR 1397).  
 
6.  On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the Respondents 
have contended that the Respondents are not Civil Servants and their terms 
and conditions of service are regulated  by the North -West Frontier 
Constabulary Act, 1915, and the Rules framed there -under . They contended 
that the learned  High Court did have the jurisdi ction to adjudicate upon the 
matters relating to terms and conditions of service of the Respondent. They 
next contended that the Appellants had recorded findings in violation of the 
procedure prescribed under Rule 18 of the North West Frontier Constabulary  
Rules of 1958  (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 1958) , therefore, the 
learned High Court was justified in ordering their reinstatement.  
 
7.  The Respondents’ Counsel next contended that the Appeals are 
barred by time and should have been dismissed  on the point of limitation, as 
the grounds taken for condonation of delay are not plausible.  
 
8.  We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at length and 
have perused the record. The Appellants are not Civil Servants as their terms 
and conditions  of service are regulated by the provisions of the North West 
Frontier Constabulary Rules of 1958 . The case law cited by the learned 
Counsel for the Appellants is not relevant after the judgment of this Court in 
the case of Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam and oth ers vs. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2006 SC 602), where this Court has held that the status of a 
Civil Servant cannot be conferred on an employee of the organization by a 
deeming clause which has its own statutory service Rules. The terms and C.As.No.1122/13 etc.  5 
conditions of  service of the Respondents are regulated by the Act of 19 15 
which authorizes the Appellants to frame Rules. The Rules were  framed in 
1958 and are duly notified which regulates the terms and conditions of 
service of the Respondents. The plea of the Appella nts that the Respondents 
are Civil Servants is without force in view of the judgment in the case of 
Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam and others  (supra)  
 
9.  The contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellants that 
proper procedure was followed while dismissin g the Respondents from 
service, we have examined the procedure provided in Rule 18 ( ibid) and the 
material brought on record by the parties. The orders which were impugned 
before the learned High Court are indicative of the fact that procedure as 
defined i n Rule 18 of the Rules of 1958 was not followed. Even the learned 
High Court has observed in the impugned judgment that de novo  inquiries 
were conducted by the Appellants without following the procedure provided 
in Rule 18 of the Rules of 1958. Once the le arned High Court has held that 
the procedure prescribed in Rule 18 ( ibid)  has not been followed while 
dismissing the Respondents from service, it should have remanded the 
matter to the department  after reinstating the Respondents in service  for de 
novo  inquiry.    
 
10.  We, therefore, while partly allowing these Appeals remand the 
matter s to the departmental Authority of the Appellants to hold de novo  
inquiry after reinstating the Respondents in service, by strictly following the 
procedure provided in Rule 18 of the Rules of 1958 and pass appropriate 
orders within four months from the date of communication of this judgment.  C.As.No.1122/13 etc.  6 
11.  Since the points raised in the Appeals are of public importance, 
therefore, the delay in filing the Appeals is condoned on the gro unds taken 
in the Applications for condonation of delay. The above are the reasons for 
our short order of even date which reads as under: - 
 “For reasons to be recorded later, these appeals are 
partially allowed and the impugned judgments of the High 
Court are set aside to the extent of setting aside the order 
of dismissal of the respondents by the Commandant 
Frontier Constabulary. However, since the procedure laid 
down in Rule 18 of the NWFP Frontier Constabulary 
Rules, 1958, had not been followed during th e inquiry 
conducted against the respondents, a de novo inquiry 
according to the said Rule may be conducted against the 
respondents. In order to hold the inquiry the respondents 
have to be reinstated. Since three inquiries have already 
been held, the fresh inquiry shall be concluded within a 
period of four months.”
