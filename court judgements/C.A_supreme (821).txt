O R D E R  
  AMIR HANI MUSLIM, J. -  We have heard the lea rned Counsel 
for the parties. We have noticed that the Miscellaneous Appeal No.58 of 
2015 was filed against the order dated 16.09.2015, of the Pakistan Electronic 
Media Regulatory Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) passed 
under Section 30  of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority 
Ordinance, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance), which order was C.P.No.173/2017.  2 
communicated to the Respondent No.1 on 23.09.2015. This order pertained 
to suspension of licence s of the Respondent No.1. On 28.09.201 6, the 
learned High Court suspended the order of the Authority. On 19.10.201 6, the 
learned High Court was informed that the order dated 16.09.2015 impugned 
in the Appeal was withdrawn by the Authority . The learned High Court in its 
order dated 19. 10.2016 has noticed this fact, but adjourned the matter to 
08.11.2016, though  it ought to have disposed of the Miscellaneous Appeal of 
the Respondent No.1.  
2.  On 23.12.2016, a show cause notice was issued by the 
Authority to the Respondent No.1 on the gr ound that the Ministry of Interior 
have re gretted  the security clearance of the Directors of Respondent No.1. 
This show cause notice was challenged by the Respondent No.1, by filing an 
Application in the Appeal No.58 of 2015 instead of filing reply to the 
Authority. The learned High Court suspended the show cause notice and 
also issue d contempt notice on the Application of the Respondent No.1 , 
which was filed alongwith the aforesaid application for interim relief.   
3.  On 26.01.2017, the authority issued a nother prohibitory order in 
exercise of powers under Section 27 of the Ordinance in relation to a 
programme titled as “ Aisay Nahi Chalay GA ”. This prohibitory order, 
according to the Counsel for the Authority, was issued on the bas is of 
complaints received  to the Authority from different quarters that through the 
said programme Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain  delivers “hate speeches”. The 
order was passed on 26.01.2017, and the show cause was issued to 
Respondent No.1 on 27.01.2017 . The Respondent No.1 challenged both the 
orders of the Authority. The learned High Court while suspending the C.P.No.173/2017.  3 
prohibitory order of the Authority, issued a contempt notice on the 
application to the Chairman of the Authority.  
4.  The learned Counsel for the Respondent No.1 concedes that 
orders dated 23. 09.2016 , 26.01.2017  and 27.01.2017  ought to have been 
challenged by the Respondent No.1, by filing separate Appeals and could 
not have been challenged through C.M.As in a disposed of Appeal, which 
had become infr uctuous after 19.10.2016, when  the Authority ha d 
withdrawn its order s dated 16.09.2015, the subject -matter of the Appeal.  
5.  We, in view of the fair stance taken by the learned Counsel for 
the Respondent No1, hold as under: - 
I. Miscellaneous Appeal No.58 of 2015 on withdrawal of 
the order dated 1 6.09.2015 has become infructuous . All 
the contempt applications made in th e Miscellaneous 
Appeal  by the Respondent No.1 will not be pressed by 
the Respondent No.1 and would stand disposed of .  
II. So far as t he show cause notice issued on 23.1 2.2016 by 
the Authority  is concerned, the Respondent No.1 is at 
liberty to submit reply to the Authority which on receipt 
of the reply will pass appropriate orders, after hearing the 
Respondent No.1 or his representative.  
III. The order dated 26.01.2017 s hall hold the field and the 
Respondent No.1 may file its reply before the Authority . 
Likewise, show cause notice dated 27.01.2017 , issued by 
the Authority  shall also be replied to by the Respondent 
No.1 and after hearing, the Authority shall pass 
appropria te orders.  C.P.No.173/2017.  4 
iv. However, if either of the parties feels aggrieved by any of 
the orders passed by the Authority, it may, if so advised, 
prefer Appeal in terms of the Ordinance.  
6.  This Petition is converted into Appeal and is disposed of in the 
above term s.  
  C.M.A.No.670 of 2017.  
  This Application is disposed of in terms of the above order.
