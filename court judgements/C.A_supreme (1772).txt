whether the said schemes were based on feasible reports. If such 
Schemes are found to be in accordance with the conditions and 
observations made hereinabove the paymen ts to the Contractors may be 
released to the extent of the work already completed.  
3.  As far as the left over work is concerned, it should be

not to be in the public interest or feasible, the same shall be abandoned  
subject to the approval of the Competent Authority i.e . on whose behalf 
the Schemes were initiated ; and the funds so made available shall be 
deposited with the public exchequer. The said Competent Authority
