ORDER  
1. Learned Mr. Salman Aslam Butt states that Bahria Town (Pvt.) 
Limited (‘ Bahria Town ’), whom he represents, has filed Civil Misc. 
Application (‘ CMA ’) Nos. 11052/2019, 1234/2021 , 1235/2021 and 
8884/2023  in February and March 2021, but were not fixed for hearing for 
over two and a half years for no discernible reason. It is submitted that a 
consent order was passed by this Court on 21 March 2019 under which 
Bahria Town was supposed to have been given 16,896 acres of land in 
District Malir but it received  only 11,747 acres of land . In this regard he 
has referred to a letter of Malir Development Authority (‘ MDA ’) which, 
according to learn ed counsel, supports his stance. Therefore, since 16,896 
acres of land were not delivered to Bahria Town it stopped making payment  
to which it had consented and that needs  to be re-assessed.  
 
2. Learned senior counsel Mr. Farooq H. Nae k represents MDA and 
states that MDA filed concise statement (CMA No. 2039/2020 ) with regard 
to CMA No. 11052/2019 which was filed by Bahria Town . He states that 
Bahria Town is in possession of 12,237.5 acres of land and the remaining 
land could not be given to Bahria Town because it was utilized by different 
utility providers.  
 
3. Syed Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi states that it was on his complaint that 
this matter was taken note of by this Court . He states that he has filed 
CMA No. 339/2021 and another applicatio n, which has not been 
numbered, wherein he has alleged that Bahria Town is in possession of 
37,777 acres and the contentions of Bahria Town and MDA are not correct.  
The un -numbered application be numbered and notice of both application s 
be issued to Bahri a Town, to MDA and to the Government of Sindh, who , if 
they dispute the allegation , may file concise statement with requisite proof.  
 
4. The consent order dated 21 March 2019 had mentioned that 460 
billion rupees was the price of the land, the period with in which it was to be 
paid, the mode of its payment, and that if two consecutive installments or 
three installments in toto  were not paid it would constitute a default. The 
past/present  directors/shareholders/promoters  of Bahria Town stood as 
guarantors of the said amount. In view of Bahria Town’s commitment the 
filing of Reference by National Accountability Bureau  was stayed.   Civil Misc. Application No. 8758/18 etc.

5. However, of the agreed amount 460 billion rupees only about 60.72 
billion rupees were paid of which Bahria Town paid 24.26  billion rupees  
and the allottees paid about 1 billion rupees. In response to our query  
learned Mr. Salman Aslam Butt stated that as per media reports certain 
amounts were remitted from abroad and paid pursuant to an agreem ent, 
and that he will be filing requisite documents in this regard.  
 
6. The following persons , as per the consent order , had guaranteed  to 
make payment if Bahria Town fail ed to pay:  
 
(1) Malik Riaz Hussain s on of Malik Aashiq Hussain,  
(2)  Ahmed Ali Riaz s on of Malik Riaz Hussain,  
(3)  Mrs. Bina Riaz w ife of Malik Riaz Hussain and  
(4) Mr. Zain Malik s on of Arshad Malik.  
 
 Therefore, since the interest of the aforesaid may be affected notices 
be issued to them.   
 
 It would be appropriate to also issue notices to those who had 
remitted  monies from abroad  (about UK Pounds 136 million and about US 
Dollars  44 million ), which was converted into Pakistani rupees (about 35 
billion  rupees) , who are  as under:  
 
(1) Fortune Event Limited,  Emirates Hill, MC -2, P.O. Box

EC4 V 4AY , GB.  
  
 Notices to the above be sent through registered post and also through 
the Pakistan Embassy/High Commission or Pakistan Consulate.  
 
7. Learned Mr. Hassan  Akbar , the Advocate -General, Sindh (‘AG’) seeks 
time to file concise statement. He further states that the amount s that were 
paid should be given to the Government of Sindh since the subject land 
was of the Government of Sindh , and in this regard has referred to CMA 
Nos. 8038/2020, 3519/2021 and 7469/2021. However, learned Mr. Farooq 
H. Naek  states that MDA is entitled to the said monies as it had bought the 
land from the Government of Sindh . Since the Government of Sindh and 
MDA have taken contrary positions, they should file concise statements 
with supporting documents of ownership/sale of the said land .  
 
8. Learned Mr. Salman Aslam Butt read paragraph 18 of order dated 4 
May 2018 , and read orders dated 21 March 2019 and 20 October 2020 , 
and its  Annex. All the learned counsel and learned AG state that the 
Commission which had been constituted (detailed in the said Annex ) never 
functioned as the Chief Justice  did not appoint its Chairman . The learned 
AG and the learned counsel to assist whether it is incumbent upon the 
Chief Justice to appoint such Chairman, and if the Chief Justice does not 
appoint the Chairman what would become of the Commission ; in this 
regard we look more towards senior counsel to assist and the seni or most 
counsel before us is Mr. Farooq H. Naek. They should also assist on 
whether the order dated 21 March 2019 can be varied, modified or 
amended . 
 
9. During the hearing we enquired whether MDA and the Sindh 
Building Control Authority (‘ SBCA ’) had issue d requisite approvals to the 
project of Bahria Town. Mr. Farooq H. Naek stated that he will be 
submitting documents on behalf of MDA and the learned AG stated he will 
be submitting the same on behalf of SBCA ; MDA  and SBCA are directed to 
do so through thei r respective concise statements signed by senior most 
persons of the said organizations.  
 Civil Misc. Application No. 8758/18 etc.

10. Learned Mian Abdul Rauf states that he does not want to press Civil 
Misc. Appeal No. 53 of 2020, which was ordered to be fixed in Court . 
Therefore , the same is d ismissed as not pressed.  
  
11. Learned Mr. Haseeb Jamali states that he has filed C ivil Misc. Appeal 
No. 176/2021 on behalf of some of the allottees of Bahria Town, seeking to 
be arrayed as parties. Learned Mr. Aftab Alam Yasir states that he has filed 
Civil Misc. Appeal No. 107/2020 wherein a similar prayer is made.  Learned 
Nayab Hassan Gardezi states that he has filed Criminal Original Petition 
No. 118/2019 on behalf of some allottees. Learned Mr. Salman Aslam Butt 
strongly oppose s entertaining these ap peals/petition as it will result in the 
matter never concluding because there are thousand s of allottees and each 
one may start agitat ing their individual grievance s; the learned AG agrees . 
Since there are a very large number of allottees and as this Court  is 
cognizant of the interest of the allottees, therefore, we do not consider it 
appropriate to array them as parties , but counsel representing the allottees 
may attend Court proceedings and interject whenever they consider the 
interest of the allottees is  being adversely affected . Accordingly, the 
applications and the petition are disposed of , however, t hey may move 
appropriate applications, if subsequently they deemed it necessary .  
 
12. The abovementioned concise statements/document s must be filed 
latest by Monday, 6 November 2023 , failing which the same may not be 
considered.  
 
13. Adjourned to Wednesday,  8 November 2023 . It is clarifi ed that no 
request for adjournment will be entertained, and if any counsel cannot 
attend he or his client s hall make alternate arrangements.
