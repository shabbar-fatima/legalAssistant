O R D E R  
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUHDRY, C.J . — By means 
of the in stant short order, we intend to dispose of Civil Petition No. 
796 of 2007 filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution for leave to 
appeal against the judgment dated 26.06.2007 passed by High Court 
of Balochistan in Const itution Petition No.892 of 2006 , Constitution 
Petitions directly filed before this Court under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution and certain miscellaneous applications .  
2.   We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at 
length  and have gone through the impugned judgment as well a s the 
material placed before us.  
3.   On 25.05.2011, a consent order was passed by this Court 
in the instant  case, reported as Abdul Haq Baloch v. Government of 
Balochistan  (PLD 2011 SC 835) , which contains uncontroverted facts 
between the parties  summari zed in Para. Nos.  2 to 6 & 8. The same 
are reproduced hereunder:  -    
“2.  The uncontroverted facts that emerge from the 
concise statements, documents and submissi ons of the 
parties are that for  the purpose of conducting exploration 
and development of mine ral deposits of gold and copper in 
the agreed Exploration Area, in District Chaghai of the 
Province of Balochistan, Pakistan, Balochistan 
Development Authority (BDA) on the approval of the 
Government of Balochistan (GOB), entered into CHAGHA I CP 796 -2007 etc.  5 
HILLS EXPLORA TION JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT dated 
29th July, 1993 (CHEJVA) with BHP MINERALS 
INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION INC (BHP); a foreign 
company. BDA was to provide administrative support, 
necessary consents, approvals, NOCs, security clearances 
etc., etc., and relaxa tion of certain Rules of the Balochistan 
Mining Concession Rules, 1970. BHP was to undertake the 
work and entire cost of the exploration and infrastructure 
etc. thereof. The respective Percentage Interests were 
25% for BDA and 75% for BHP. The Joint Ventur e was 
granted ten Prospect ing Licenses (P Ls) in 1996 for an area 
of 1000 Sq. Km. BHP carried out reconnaissance and 
detailed work up to 1999 in these areas and reported large 
deposits of Copper, Gold etc. at Reko -Diq. The Joint 
Venture thereafter surrender ed 8-PL's and retained Two 
PLs of Reko -Diq. After the new National Mineral Policy and 
the enactment of Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, a 
consolidated Exploration License No.EL -5 was granted to 
the Joint Venture for a defined area of Reko -Diq in 2002 
for three years. On two renewals thereof, EL -5 was to 
remain valid upto 18th February, 2011.  
3.  During the extended period of EL -5, ADDENDUM 
No.1 to the CHEJVA was signed between BDA/GOB and 
BHP, whereby inter alia, Government of Balochistan 
became  a Joint Ven ture partner in CHEJVA with BDA as its 
Agent. ADDENDUM also permitted transfer or assignment  
of a party's interests in CHEJV A wholly or partly. Whereon 
through intermediary corporate instrumentalities , share 
interest of BHP in CHEJV A was routed and re -routed via 
Mincor Resources N.L/Tethyan Copper Company Ltd., of 
Australia (TCC) per the OPTION AGREEMENT/ALLIANCE 
AGREEMENT. And finally under the NOVATION AGREEMENT 
OF 2006 JVA was novated to substitute TCC for BHP as a 
full party with Deed of Waiver and Cons ent of GOB for 
such transfer. BHP was thus replaced by TCC in the Joint 
Venture which became TCC -BDA/GOB' CHAGAI HILLS 
JOINT VENTURE. The respective Percentage Interests were 
restated for GOB (25%) and TCC (75%). Antofagasta of 
Chile and Barrick Gold Corpo ration of Canada; stated to be 
amongst the largest companies prospecting for gold and 
copper in the world, then stepped in and jointly purchased 
TCC's entire 75% Percentage Interest in the Joint Venture. 
Antofagasta and Barrick Gold; on thus acquiring TCC,  
carried out the drilling and exploration programme at EL -5 
area of Reko -Diq at a claimed expense of millions of US $, 
with no financial cost burden on GOB/BDA.  
4.  In 2006, C.P. No. 892 of 2006 was filed by Maulana 
Abdul Haq etc., in the Balochistan High Court challenging 
legality of CHEJVA, relaxation of 1970 Mining Rules by GOB 
and BHP's lukewarm exploration activity. The Government 
of Balochistan denied illegality of CHEJVA and its alleged 
contrariness to public interest. This Constitutional Petition 
was dismissed by the High Court of Balochistan through CP 796 -2007 etc.  6 
the impugned judgment dated 26 -6-2007. The relaxation 
of 1970 Rules, acts of GOB/BDA and CHEJVA were held to 
be legal. Hence C.P.L.A. No. 796 of 2007 in this Court 
against the above judgment.  
5.  During the pendency of the leave petition, a major 
development took place. Exploration work including drilling 
was completed by TCC within the stipulated period. 
Substantial discoveries of gold and copper etc. were made. 
The license period expired on 18th of Febr uary, 2011. TCC 
submitted to GOB Feasibility Study Report; a study to 
ascertain the commercial feasibility of the mining of the 
resource, treatment of ore obtained in mining operation, 
expected optimum return, life of the mine, mineable 
reserves and grade and the results of geological and 
geophysical investigations etc. The Feasibility Study is 
admittedly under examination of GOB.  
6.  The above mentioned feasibility report was offered 
by the former Advocate General i.e. Mr. Salahuddin 
Mengal to be exclusive ly shared with this Court though 
claiming the same to be sensitive, confidential, highly 
technical and ordinarily beyond the Court's domain.  
7. … …  
8.  During the hearing of the matter, TCC formally 
applied to the Government of Balochistan within the 
visualized period for the grant of the mining lease under 
2002 Rules whic h statedly recognized the licens ee’s 
entitlement to apply for a minin g lease on success of the 
licens ee in the exploration. ”  
The concluding paragraph s therefrom are  also reproduced 
hereinbelow: -   
“13. We are in agreement with the learned counsel for the 
parties and are of the opinion that at this stage it will not 
be proper for us to inquire into the Feasibility Study Report 
or to rule upon the entitlement of TCC to the mining lease. 
The reason  is that under the governing law and 2002 
Rules, this matter falls exclusively within the domain of the 
Government of Balochistan and the Government is also 
seized of the Feasibility Report as well as the application of 
TCC. All the parties have ex pressly admitted that the 
Government of Balochistan being the competent authority 
in this matter, should in due discharge of its obligation, 
make a decision on TCC's application impartially, 
objectively and in accordance with law and thus accept its 
legal responsibility thereof. In this view of the matter, it 
will not be proper for us to pre -empt the decision of the 
Government of Balochistan by entering into the merits of 
the case at this juncture.   CP 796 -2007 etc.  7 
14. As such accepting the consensus of all the learned 
counsel and for the reasons above recorded , the 
restraining order dated 3 -2-2011 is recalled. The 
competent authority in the Government of Balochistan 
shall proceed to expeditiously decide TCC's application for 
the grant of mining lease transparently and fair ly in 
accordance with the law and the rules. In so doing the 
Government of Balochistan shall not be influenced in any 
manner whatsoever by the pendency of these proceedings 
or by the orders therein passed by this Court. Upon 
decision of the matter by the G overnment of Balochistan, 
the learned Advocate General of the Province shall inform 
the Registrar of this Court forthwith. The petitions shall 
remain pending on the file of this Court until the decision 
of the application by the competent authority. ” 
4.  Admittedly, application for grant of mining lease submitted 
by Tethyan Copper Company  Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. (TCCP), incorporated 
in Pakistan , was dismissed by the Mines Committee  constituted under 
the Balochistan Mining Rules, 2002 (hereinafter referred to a s the BMR 
2002) in its special meeting  held on 14.11.2011  and the decision 
communicated to TCC P vide letter dated 15.11.2011. TCCP challenged 
the said decision by means of an administrative appeal  before the 
Secretary, Department of  Mines & Mine rals, Gover nment of 
Balochistan , as provided under the BMR 2002 , which too was 
dismissed. Both these orders were not challenged by TCCP. However, 
Tethyan Copper Company  (TCC), incorporated in Australia , invoked 
the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlem ent of 
Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) against the Government of Balochistan  
(GOB)  seeking specific performance of CHEJVA and grant of mining 
lease. The claim of TCC was not registered by ICSID . Later, TCC filed a 
claim against the Government of Pakistan on th e basis  of the Pakistan -
Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty  of 1998 , which is reportedly 
pending for adjudication . The claimant also moved an application for 
provisional measures to immediately grant a temporary restraint order 
pending disposition of the  request . In the said application, it was CP 796 -2007 etc.  8 
requested to freeze the work of the GOB in 99 square kilomet ers 
including H -4 ‘Tanjeel’ . Dr. Samar Mubarakmand also entered 
appearance as a witness before the Tribunal o n 06.11.2012 and stated 
that the GOB was plan ning to work in H-4 area as early as possible. 
The ICSID  Tribunal vide decision dated 14.12.2012 rejected the 
application of TCC for provisional measures and allowed the GOB and 
Dr. Samar  Mubarakmand to carry out mining in H-4 ‘Tanjeel’ in Reko 
Diq. The pl ea of TCC regarding urgency and irreparable loss was also 
declined.  However, the GOB was asked to keep the Tribunal informed 
of its specific plans and development s at the site.  Simultaneously, TCC 
had also invoked the jurisdiction of the International Cham ber of 
Commerce (ICC)  primarily s eeking specific performance of CHEJVA and 
grant of mining lease in the Reko Diq area of 99 kilometers comprising 
14 deposits.   
5.   These facts have been noted to point out that TCCP on 
having accepted the order of rejectio n of application for grant of 
mining lease as well as  the order of the  appellate authority under the 
BMR 2002 , instead of invoking the jurisdiction of the High Cour t under 
Article  199 of the Constitution  for judicial review of both the orders, 
approach ed ICSID and ICC purportedly in light of the provision of 
Article 15 of CHEJVA executed between BHP and BDA . It may be 
advantageous to reproduce the said Article, which reads as under : -  
15.4  Arbitration   
 
15.4.1  Any dispute in respect of which:  
 
(i) amicabl e settlement has not been 
reached within one hundred and twenty 
(120) days of written notice of the 
dispute;  
(ii) neither Party requests resolution of the 
dispute by the Expert within the thirty 
(30) day period set forth in Clause 15.2 CP 796 -2007 etc.  9 
or a decision by the  Expert pursuant to 
Clause 15.2 has not become final and 
bindin g pursuant to sub -clause 15.2.5;  
or 
(iii) pursuant to sub -clause 15.2.2 the Parties 
fail to agree upon the appointment of an 
Expert,  
 
shall be submitted to the International Centre 
for the Settlement  of Industrial Disputes (the 
“Centre”) established by the Convention for 
Settlement of Other States in effect since 
October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”) .  
 
15.4.2  To the extent required by the ISCID 
Convention each of the Parties agrees to 
submit to a rbitration under the ISCID 
Convention, but should sub -clause 15.4.8 
operate, then the Parties agree to submit to an 
arbitration conducted pur suant to the ICC 
Rules.  
 
15.4.3  In all cases of arbitration pursuant to this 
Clause 15.4:  
 
(a) arbitration shall t ake place in London, 
United Kingdom, unless the Parties 
decide otherwise;  
(b) the language of the arbitration shall be 
English and all hearing materials, 
statements of claims or defence, and 
awards and the reasons supporting them 
shall be in English; and  
(c) the costs of the arbitration shall be borne 
by the losing Party.  
 
15.4.4  In rendering their decision, the arbitrators shall 
consider the intention of the Parties at the time 
of entering into this Agreement insofar as it 
may be ascertained from the Agr eement, 
Pakistan law, and as provided by Article 16, 
generally accepted standards and principles of 
international law applicable to the mining 
industry.  
 
15.4.5  Any arbitrator(s) appointed pursuant to this 
Clause 15.4 shall have the full power to review 
and revise any decision, recommendation or 
opinion of the Expert related to the dispute. No 
Party shall be limited in the arbitral 
proceedings to evidence or arguments 
submitted to the Expert pursuant to Clause 
15.2, and nothing shall prevent the Expert 
from being called as a witness to give evidence 
before the arbitrators.  CP 796 -2007 etc.  10
 
15.4.6  The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final 
and binding upon the Parties, and any Party 
may seek to enforce or execute the award in 
any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties 
hereby waive any defence or sovereign 
immunity they may have or claim to have in 
relation to any action brought to enforce or 
execute any arbitral award.  
 
15.4.7  For the purposes of arbitration pursuant to the 
ICSID Convention, the Parties agree t hat the 
transactions to which this Agreement relates 
constitute an investment within the meaning of 
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.  
  
15.4.8  In case, for whatever reason, the Centre 
should not accept jurisdiction or should reject 
the arbitration req uest, the dispute shall be 
finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation 
and Arbitration of the International Chamber of 
Commerce (the “ICC Rules”) and the 
provisions of sub -clauses 15.4.3, 15.4.4, 
15.4.5 and 15.4.6 shall apply. Arbitration shall 
be cond ucted by one sole arbitrator appointed 
by mutual agreement of the Parties. This 
arbitrator shall have extended experience in 
the mining field. In case the Parties cannot 
agree on the choice of the arbitrator, 
arbitration shall be of a nationality other tha n 
that of the Parties and shall have extended 
experience in the mining field. In case the 
Parties cannot agree on the choice of the 
arbitrator, arbitration shall be conducted by 
three arbitrators named in accordance with the 
ICC Rules.  
   
6.   Before subm itting the application for issuance of 
Prospecting Licence s (PLs) under the Balochistan Mineral Concession 
Rules,  1970 (BMCR 1970) , the counsel of BHP Mr. Martin Harris had 
suggested relaxation of a number of rules, including  the rule relating 
to persons b y whom applications may be made. It appears that the 
request made by BHP ’s counsel  was forwarded by BDA to the  GOB and 
ultimately notification dated 30.01.1994  was issued, whereby following 
relaxations were granted: -  
1. Grant of Exploration Areas   CP 796 -2007 etc.  11
2. Area ava ilable for prospecting Licences  
3. Application for prospecting Licence  
4. Satisfaction of conditions attaching to prospecting 
Licences  
 
5. Exclusive right  
6. Other Minerals  
7. Government rights pre -emption acquisition merger, 
and takin g control in National emergency  
8. Assignment  
9. Application for Mining Licence  
10. Royalty  
11. Penaltie s compensation and cancellation  
12. Employment and tr aining  
13. Mining Lease  
 
7.   In the year  1996, BHP applied for 10 PLs, which were 
granted on 08.12.1996 . It appears that CHEJVA , which was originally 
execu ted between BHP and BDA was suffering from certain legal 
deficiencies, therefore, Addendum No.1 to CHEJVA was executed o n 
04.03.2000 , allegedly under the authorization of the then Governor  of 
Balochistan , Justice (Retd) Amir -ul-Mulk Mengal . It is pertinent  to note 
that t hrough the Addendum , drastic changes were m ade in CHEJVA , 
inasmuch as  permission was granted for transfer or assignment of a 
party ’s interests in the agreement wholly or partly.  Further, the GOB 
was made a joint venture partner  and the BDA r epresented itself as an 
agent of GOB through ratification of agency.  Thus, there are serious 
question marks on the manner in which the then Governor of 
Balochistan  granted authorization by executing an undated document . 
However, from certain documents it a ppears that the same was 
executed on 24.12.1999.  Although prior to this authorization, former 
Governor Syed Fazal Agha had not signed the document, which was 
placed before him for the purpose of executing authorization, prima CP 796 -2007 etc.  12
facie, for the reason that bef ore 12.10.1999, the GOB through the 
Chief Minister had decided to constitute a two -member committee to 
examine th e said document. The need and justification of the 
Addendum is given in Para s A, B, C and D  thereof , which read as 
under: -  
A. The GOB, through t he Chairman of the BDA, and 
BHPM intended to enter into a Joint venture 
Agreement for mineral exploration in the Chagai hills 
in the Province of Balochistan, which was executed 
on 29 .07.1993 (… …) and it is desirable to clarify the 
roles of each of GOB and  the BDA under the JVA;   
B. Pursuant to GOB’s intention to appoint the BDA as its 
agent in connection with the JVA, the BDA has 
exercised its rights and discharged its obligations 
under the JVA as if it were a Joint Venture r rather 
than the agent of the GOB. The GOB and BHPM now 
wish (i) to clarify the role of the BDA under the JVA 
as agent of the GOB and the scope of its authority to 
act on behalf of the GOB in connection with the JVA, 
and (ii) to have the GOB confirm and ratify all past 
actions, matters and things done by the BDA in 
connection with the JVA;   
C. Pursuant to the issue of the JVA, BHPM, on behalf o f 
the Joint Venture, has completed Stage One 
Activities (as defined in sub -clause 1.1 of the JVA) 
and has identified certain anomalous mineralized 
areas in respect of which the BDA and BHPM have 
jointly obtained ten (10) Prospecting Licences  in 
order to enable BHPM to conduct Stage Two 
Activities on behalf of the Joint Venture; and   
D. The GOB and BHPM have agreed to amend certain 
terms of the JVA as set out  hereunder. ”  
 
Thus, by means of the Addendum, in the name of ratification in terms 
of section 196 of the Contract Act, 1872,  instead of supplementing 
CHEJVA,  its entire complexion was changed .  
8.   On the basis of  the Addendum , an ‘Option  Agreement ’ was 
also executed and in the garb of reliance on one of the clauses 
contained in CHEJVA , namely, Article 14 ‘Assignment’, Mincor option 
was created in favour of Mincor NL, a company incorporated in 
Western Australia, enabling it to enter into an Alliance Agree ment 
under clause 3 of the Option Agreement. The Mincor Option gave the CP 796 -2007 etc.  13
sole and exclusive right to Mincor or its nominee to enter into alliance 
with BHP to explore in the region. On 24.10.2000, TCC , as nominee of 
Mincor, exercis ed the Mincor Option and  executed an Alliance 
Agreement on 19.04.2002.  It may be mentioned that TCC was a 
company incorporated in Western Australia with its place of business 
situated at Perth. In 2006 , Antofagasta, a Chilean company registered 
in the United Kingdom through its subs idiary Atacama Copper P vt. 
Ltd., made an offer to buy the shares of TCC, which was accepted by 
the Board of TCC. As such , Antofagasta through Atacama acquired the 
total shares of TCC for AUD 220 million. TCC also purchased the claw 
back right of BHP for US$60 million. In September 2006 , Barrick Gold  
of Canada  purchased 50% shares of Atacama from Antofagasta  
through share -purchase  agreement and thus acquired 50% ownership 
interest of TCC.  Pursuant to the share -sale agreement, an interim 
shareholders agreemen t dated 22.09.2006 was executed between 
Barrick  Gold and Antofagasta to govern their relationship vis-à-vis the 
management of TCC. TCC started its operations in Pakistan through its 
Branch Office registered with the Board of Investment. It also 
incorporate d a local subsidiary in Pakistan called TCCP. I n December, 
2007, TCCP approached the Lahore High Court for amalgamation of 
TCC’s Branch Office in Pakistan  and TCCP , incorporated in Pakistan , 
which had been functioning  simultaneously until that time. 
Subseq uently , the Islamabad High Court , to whose file the case was 
transferred on its establishment,  vide order dated 11. 04.2008 
approved the amalgamation of both the companies as per the scheme 
of arrangement. As such , licences and propert ies held by Pakistan 
Branch of TCC stood transferred to TCCP. In the meanwhile, the BMR 
2002 were enforced , and on 03.09.2002, TCCP applied for an CP 796 -2007 etc.  14
Exploration Licence (EL) for copper , gold and associated minerals in an 
area of 973.75 sq. km. in Chagai District  and was granted EL-5 vide 
letter dated 09.09.2002.  EL-5 was  renewed twice and  remain ed valid 
upto 18 .02.2011.   
9.  In April  2006, BHP, TCC and GOB through its purported 
agent BDA, executed a Novation Agr eement to CHEJVA, whereby the 
75% interest of BHP in the agreement as well as in EL -5 was 
transferred to TCC. The detail of companies involved in the entire 
transaction and the transfer of interest inter se is given below: -

The Novatio n Agreement was purportedly made for the purpose of 
substituting CHEJVA , and the GOB was also made a party to the Joint 
Venture, which was not permissible under BMR 2002 as well as the 
Rules of Business of the Government of Balochistan , particularly Rule 7 CP 796 -2007 etc.  15
and other rules.  The GOB, in purported exercise of the powers vested 
in it under the BMR 2002, granted relaxations in violation of rule 98 
ibid as no reason was assigned for the relaxation of the relevant Rules.  
10.   In addition to these defects, it is i mportant to note that 
after having invoked the jurisdiction of the original as well as the 
appellate authority under the BMR 2002, TCC had submitted to its 
forum/jurisdiction . Both these authorities had derived their  powers and  
jurisdiction from the BMR 2002, which were framed under the Act of 
1948. The findings so recorded are adversely operating against them  
and, for all intent s and purpose s, they have no claim of any nature 
whatsoever against the GOB or the Government of  Pakistan.  
11.   It is also to be  noted that in the Constitution  Petition filed 
before the High Court of Balochistan, the GOB had opposed the 
petition . However, when the matter came up before this Court in CPLA 
in 2007  and order s dated 03.02.2011  and 25.05.2011 w ere passed, 
wherein certai n issues  were noted , the GOB supported the stance of 
the petitioners , who  also filed additional grounds in light of the 
changed circumstances . This Court, besides being seized of CPLA, is 
also seized of Constitution  Petitions under Article  184(3) of the 
Constitution  and miscellaneous applications  filed therein . Accordingly , 
CPLA as well as Constitution  Petition s under Article  184(3) of the 
Constitution  are simultaneously maintainable under the Constitution  
and the scope of the relief claimed by the petition ers can be enlarged 
in view of the facts and circumstances of the case.  
12.   Thus, for detailed reasons to be recorded later , CPLA is 
converted into appeal and the appeal as well as t he Constitution  
Petition s under Article  184(3) of the Constitution  are allowed  with 
costs throughout whereas  the Miscellaneous Applications are disposed CP 796 -2007 etc.  16
of. The Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 
23.07.1993 is held to have been executed contrary to the provisions of 
the Mineral Development Act, 1948, the M ining Concession Rules, 
1970 framed thereunder, the Contract Act, 1872, the Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882, etc., and is even otherwise not valid, therefore, 
the same is declared to be illegal , void and non est. The Addendum 
No. 1 dated 04.03.2000, Option Agreement dated 28.04.2000, Alli ance 
Agreement dated 03.04.2002 and  Novation Agreement dated 
01.04.2006,  which are based upon , and emanate from , CHEJVA  are 
also held to be illegal and void. All these instruments do not confer  any 
right on BHP, MINCOR, TCC, TCCP, Antofagasta  or Barrick Gold  in 
respect of the matters covered therein . It is further held that EL-5 is 
tantamount to exploration contrary to rules and regulations as the 
claim of TCC P is based on CHEJVA , which document itself has been 
held to be non est. Therefore, before exploration it was incumbent 
upon it to have sought rectification of its legal status.
