Dates of Hearing:    2, 4 and 5 January 2024.  
 
JUDGMENT  
Qazi Faez Isa, CJ . On 11 December 2023, these and  all cases  involving the 
same constitutional -legal question were ordered to be fixed before a Bench 
constituted by the Committe e under the Supreme Court (Practice and 
Procedure Act ), 2023 . The Committee decided to fix these cases for hearing 
before this seven -member Bench .  
 
2. The decision in Sami Ullah Baloch v Abdul Karim N ousherwani ,1 
which had interpreted Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan (‘ the Constitution ’) held that once a person is 
disqualified thereunder such person can never again contest elections . 
However, section 232(2) of the Elections Act , 2017 (‘ the Act ’) stipulates that 
such disqualification can last for a maximum period of five years. The 
question for our consideration is whether the decision in the Sami Ullah 
Baloch  case accords with the Constitution .  
 
3. Section 232(2) of the Act  provides that if a pe rson has been declared 
by a court to have violated Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution , such person 
would be disqualified from contesting elections for a period not exceeding 
five years.  Section 232(2) of the Act, which was enacted on 23 June 2022, 
is rep roduced hereunder:  
‘232(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other 
provisions of this Act, and other law for the time being in 
force and judgment, order or decree of any court, including 
the Supreme Court and a High Court, the disqualification of 
a person to be elected, chosen or to remain as a member of 
the Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) or a Provincial Assembly 
under paragraph (f) of clause (1) of Article 62 of the 
Constitution shall be for a period not exceeding five years 
from the declaration by the court of law in that regard and 
such declaration shall be subject to the due process of law .’ 
 
 Until the enactment of section 232(2) the law did not prescribe  the 
period for which the disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution would l ast.  
 
4. In view of the public importance of the question s to be determined by 
this Court, and as the decision may affect others too, vide order dated 11

December 2023,  it was  directed that public notices be issued ; one such 
published Public Notice2 is reproduced hereunder:  
 
‘IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN  
PUBLIC NOTICE  
(Issued pursuant to Supreme Court’s order dated 11 December 2023)  
 
While hearing Civil Appeals No. 981, 984 and 985 of 2018, the 
question of disqualification and period of disqualification under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, the applicability of the decision of the Supreme Court  
in the case of Samiullah Baloch v Abdul Karim Nausherwani  
(PLD 2018 Supreme Court 405) and section 232(2) of the 
Elections Act 2017 arose. Since the decision in the said appeals 
may affect potential candidates in the forthcoming elections, 
public notice i s hereby given to them, and they may file concise 
statements, without reference to facts of individual cases. The 
said appeals and all other cases involving the same questions 
are fixed before a seven -Member Bench on Tuesday, 2 January 
2024.   
                Registrar’  
 
5. Notices were issued to the Attorney -General for Pakistan and to all 
the Advocate Generals of the provinces since the interpretation of the 
Constitution, the Elections Act and the applicability of an earlier decision of 
the Supreme Court w as required. Notice was also issued to the Election 
Commission of Pakistan . Mr. Sami Ullah Baloch , the petitioner in  the Sami 
Ullah Baloch  case was also issued notice and his brother , Mr. Sana Ullah 
Baloch, attended a hearing but then absented himself , therefore, we 
granted Mr. Sami Ullah Baloch another opportunity to attend and/or to 
engage a counsel to represent him but he did not avail  of the same.  
 
6. The Supreme Court had decided the case of Sami Ullah Baloch on 13 
April 2018, which was before the  enactment of section 232(2) which came 
into effect on 23 June 2022. In Sami Ullah Baloch  it was decided that a 
person disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution would not be 
able to contest elections , as under :  
‘… a candidate for election  who has committed misconduct 
falling within the terms of Article  62(1)(f) of the Constitution, 
in particular, misrepresentation,  dishonesty, breach of trust, 
fraud, cheating, lack of fiduciary duty,  conflict of interest, 
deception, dishonest misappropriati on, etc. as  declared by a 
Court of civil jurisdiction has on the Islamic and also  
universal criteria of honesty, integrity and probity, rendered 
himself  unfit to hold public office … a person declared to be 
dishonest or in breach of  his trust or fiduciary d uty or being 
non-righteous or profligate must  suffer the burden of that 
finding of incapacity for as long as the  Court decree remains 
in force. Considering that the Constitution  does not fix the 
period of incapacitation of such a judgment debtor  shows a

clear intention that the lack of qualification under Article  
62(1)(f) of the Constitution should extend so long as the  
declaration  of law envisaged in Article 62(1)(f) remains in the 
field. If such  declaration is final and binding, then the 
incapacity to con test elections to any of the Legislatures 
provided by the Constitution  becomes permanent. ’3 
 
7. My distinguished colleague Yahya Afridi, J based his disagreement 
with us on the assumption that Sami Ullah Baloch  had stated that 
disqualification ‘ under Artic le 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 is neither lifelong nor permanent … ’. However, the lea rned 
Umar Ata Bandial, J (as he then was)  who had authored the judgment in 
Sami Ullah Baloch  had himself noted  that, ‘ In Sami Ullah Baloch’s case this 
Court affirmed the rule that Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution creates a 
permanent bar against contesting the general elections .’4 Additionally, 
through his separate but concurring opinion  in Sami Ullah Baloch  case, Sh. 
Azmat Saeed, J , held, that : 
 
‘… this Court on more than one occasions has already  held 
that lack of qualification suffered under Article62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution is in perpetuity. Reference,  in this behalf, may 
be made to the judgments of this  Court reported as Mian 
Najeeb -ud-Din Owasi and  another v. Amir Yar Waran and 
others (PLD 2013 SC482), Muhammad Nasir Mahmood and 
another v.  Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry 
of Law, Justice and Human Rights Division, Islamabad(PLD 
2009 SC 107) and Allah Dino Khan  Bhayo v.  Election 
Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad and  others (2013 SCMR 
1655), and no reason has been  advanced to persuade me to 
take a different view .’5 
 
History of Article 62 of the Constitution  
 
8. The qualification s required of a person who may contest elections are 
provided in Article 62 and disqualifications  are mentioned in Article 63  of 
the Constitution . The original text of Article 62 , which was unambiguous 
and clear, is reproduced hereunder:  
 
Original text of the 1973 Constitution6 
 
‘62. Qualifications for membership of Parliament .- A person shall 
not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of 
Parliament unless - 
 
(a) he is a citizen of Pakistan;

(b) he is, in the case of the National Assembly, not less than 
twenty -five years of a ge and is enrolled as a voter in any 
electoral roll for election to that Assembly;  
 
(c) he is, in the case of the Senate, not less than thirty years of 
age and is enrolled as a voter in any area in a Province or, as 
the case may be, the Federal Capital or  the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas, from where he seeks membership; 
and 
 
(d) he possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed 
by Act of Parliament. ’ 
 
9. On 5 July 1977 General Muhammad Zia -ul-Haq by force of arms took 
over the running of the country by imposing martial law . Parliament and 
provincial assemblies were dissolved , and the Federal Government and 
provincial government s were dismissed. Democracy was supplanted by one -
man rule and the Constitution configured to perpetuate it. Addit ional 
clauses were arbitrarily added to Article 62 of the Constitution when the 
transition back to democratic rule could no longer be prevented. Eight 
years after jettisoning the Constitution , the Revival  of the Constitution of 
1973 Order, 1985  was present ed to the nation as a fait accompli .7 The price 
extracted for the revival  of the Constitution were the wholesale changes 
made by General Zia -ul-Haq to the Constitution, including those inserted in 
Article 62, reproduced hereunder:  
 
‘62. Qualifications for membership of  Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament ).- A person shall not be qualified to be elected or 
chosen as a member of  Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament ) unless - 
 
(a) he is a citizen of Pakistan;  
 
(b) he is, in the case of the National Assembly, not less than 
twent y-five years of age and is enrolled as a voter in any 
electoral roll for election to a Muslim seat or a non -Muslim seat, 
as the case may be, in that Assembly ;  
 
(c) he is, in the case of the Senate, not less than thirty years of 
age and is enrolled as a vo ter in any area in a Province or, as 
the case may be, the Federal Capital or the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas, fro m where he seeks membership;  
 
(d) he is of good character and is not commonly known as one 
who violates Islamic Injunctions;  
 
(e) he h as adequate knowledge of Islamic teachings and 
practices obligatory duties prescribed by Islam as well as 
abstains from major sins;  
 
(f) he is sagacious, righteous and non -profligate and honest 
and ameen ; 
                                                
7 The Gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary, Part I, 5 December 1984.  Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.

(g) he has not been convicted for a crime involving moral 
turpitude or for giving false evidence;  
 
(h) he has not, after the establishment of Pakistan, work ed 
against the integrity of the country or opposed the ideology of 
Pakistan;  
 
Provided that the disqualifications specified in paragraphs 
(d) and (e) shall not apply to a person who is a non -Muslim, but 
such a person shall have good moral reputation; and  
 
(i) he possesses such other qualifications as may be 
prescribed by Act of Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament). ’ 
 
10. The underlying reason for adding new clauses to Article 62(1)(f) was 
not to ensure that better persons come to represent the people but to 
stymie the detractors  of General Zia -ul-Haq. The original Constitution had 
clearly delineat ed who was qualified and d isqualified to contest elections , 
but matters were obfuscated. The nation was now faced with 
sanctimonious , moralizing and aspirational words, which blurred clarity 
and precision to enable the removal of troublesome candidates.   
 
11. The additions made to  Article 62 (1) of the Constitution now required 
that a candidate in addition to the stipulated requirement must also be: 
 ‘of good character ’ 
 
 ‘not commonly known as one who violates Islamic injunctions ’ 
 
 ‘Has adequate knowledge of Islamic teaching s’ (appli cable to 
Muslims)  
 
 ‘Practices obligatory duties prescribed by Islam ’ (applicable to 
Muslims)  
 
 ‘Abstains from major sins ’ (applicable to Muslims)  
 
 ‘sagacious ’ 
 
 ‘righteous ’ 
 
 ‘non-profligate ’ 
 
 ‘honest and ameen ’ 
 
12. The minefield of vague and emotive language used in clauses (d), (e) 
and (f)  of Article 62(1)  proved difficult to d isarm . What one -man’s 
weaponized pen did to the Constitution could now only be undone by two -
thirds of the entire membership of the National Assembly and the Senate . Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 10
Through th e Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 20108 Parliament 
strived to again democratize Pakistan  and substituted t he text of Article 62 
with the f ollowing:  
  
62. Qualifications for membership of Majlis -e-Shoora 
(Parliament). -(1) A person shall not be qual ified to be elected 
or chosen as a member of Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) unless - 
 
(a) he is a citizen of Pakistan;  
 
(b) he is, in the case of the National Assembly, not less than 
twenty -five years of age and is enro lled as a voter in any 
electoral roll in - 
(i) any part of Pakistan, for election to a general seat 
or a seat reserved for non -Muslims; and  
(ii) any area in a Province from which she seeks 
membership for election to a seat reserved for women.  
 
(c) he is, in the case of Senate, not less than thirt y years of 
age and is enrolled as a voter in any area in a Province or, as 
the case may be, the Federal Capital or the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas, from where he seeks membership;  
 
(d) he is of good character and is not commonly known as 
one who vi olates Islamic Injunctions;  
 
(e) he has adequate knowledge of Islamic teachings and 
practises obligatory duties prescribed by Islam as well as 
abstains from major sins;  
 
(f) he is sagacious, righteous and non -profligate, honest and 
ameen , there being no declaration to the contrary by a court of 
law; 
 
(g) he has not, after the establishment of Pakistan, worked 
against the integrity of the country or opposed the ideology of 
Pakistan.  
 
(2) The disqualifications specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) 
shall not a pply to a person who is a non -Muslim, but such a 
person shall have good moral reputation .’ 
 
The words  - ‘there being no declaration to the contrary by a court of  law’ -
were added to clause (f)  of Article 62(1) of the Constitution . Parliament 
assumed that by requir ing a court declaration the fuse of disqualification 
could no longer be ignited  and since Article 62(1)(f) did not stipulate the 
period of disqualification it could not be conceived to be permanent.  
However, the Sami Ullah Baloch  case by reading in to the Constitution 
(words which were not there) decided that such disqualification is 
permanent.

13. The original text of the Constitution had a clear delineation between 
qualification s and disqualification s. Article 62  of the Constitution  attended 
to the Qualifications for membership of Parliament  and Article 63 to the 
Disqualifications for membership of Parliament . The distinction was blurred 
by the Revival of Constitution Order ; some changes made by it to the 
Constitution, such as adding the word Majlis -e-Shoora  to Parliament  were 
benign , however, other amendments made to the Constitution were 
circuitous and devious . Language was used to deviate from precision and 
was aimed to arouse emotions . The hallmark of any important document, 
in this case one that determine s who may represent the people and  who 
may be eligible to govern , must be precis e and should be objectively 
understandable.   
 
14. Parliamentarians had deliberated and underst ood that by adding the 
caveat - there being no declaration to th e contrary  – they had preserved the 
emotiveness of the words (inserted by General Zia -ul-Haq) in Article 62(1)(f) 
- ‘sagacious, righteous and non -profligate and honest and ameen ’ – while 
render ing these words inconsequen tial, particularly when neither the 
procedure nor any court  was conferred with jurisdiction to issue such a 
declaration mentioned  therein . Therefore, since disqualification under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution was rendered an imp ossibility , 
Parliament did not consider the necessity  to stipulate the duration of the 
disqualification.  
 
Evolving Jurisprudence  
 
15. In the case of Dr. Mobashir Hassan v Federation of Pakistan9 a 
seventeen -member Bench  of this Court had opined that Article 62(1)(f)  of 
the Constitution is not  self-executory . Somewhat the same view was 
expressed by raising the following rhetorical questions in the case of Ishaq 
Khan Khakwani v Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif10 by a seven -member  
Bench of this Court :11 
‘(a) as to which Court will be competent to make such 
declaration or to pass an order convicting a member of 
parliament;  
 
(b) what will be the procedure adopted by such Court for 
rendering such declaration/conviction;  
 
(c) what will be the standard of proof required for making 
such declaration or order of conviction;

 12
(d) as to who will have locus standi  to seek such 
declaration/conviction .’ 
 
16. In the Ishaq Khan Khakwani  case an additional note  was written by 
Jawwad S. Khawaja, J who had observed , ‘which Court will have jurisdiction 
to make the declaration or conviction  envisioned by Articles 62 and 63 will 
also need to be decided .’12 And, Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J in his additional 
note emphatically and categorically declar ed that who ‘is sagacious, 
righteous and non -profligate and honest and ameen ’ cannot be determined, 
by a court of law ; his well articulated opinion stated, as under:13 
‘Whether a person is ‘sagacious’  or not depends upon a 
comprehensive study of his mind which is not possible within 
the limited scope of election authorities or courts  involved in 
election disputes. The acumen or sagacity of a man cannot be 
fathomed. The same is true of being ‘righteous’  and ‘non-
profligate’ . These factors relate to a man's state of mind and 
cannot be properly encompassed without a detailed and in -
depth  study of his entire life. It is proverbial that Devil himself 
knoweth not the intention of man. So, why to have such 
requirements in the law, nay, the Constitution, which cannot 
even be defined, not to talk of proof. The other requirement 
qua being ‘hones t’ and ‘ameen’  have a clear ref erence towards 
the Holy Prophet’ s (p.b.u.h.) attributes as ‘Sadiq’  and ‘Ameen ’. 
This as well as other requirements envisaged by the preceding 
clauses of Article 62, if applied strictly, are probably 
incorporated in the Consti tution to ensure that only the pure 
and pious Muslims (living upto the standard of a prophet of 
God Almighty) should be elected to our Assemblies so that, as 
provided in the Preamble, the sovereignty of God Almighty 
could be exercised by them in the State of Pakistan as a 
sacred trust. But, instead of being idealistic, the Constitution 
of a country should be more practicable. The line of 
prophethood has long been discontinued and now we are left 
with sinful mortals. The political arena in our country is ful l of 
heavyweights whose social and political credentials outweigh 
their moral or religious credentials. Even the electorate in our 
country has also repeatedly demonstrated their preference for 
practical wisdom and utility over religious puritanism. Thus, 
the inclusion of unrealistic and ill -defined requirements in the 
Basic Law of the Land renders the same impracticable and 
detracts from the sanctity which the Constitution otherwise 
deserves. ’ 
 
The Sami Ullah Baloch  case  
 
17. The pertinent  observations made and questions raised in the case s of 
Dr. Mobashir Hassan  (2010) and Ishaq Khan Khakwani  (2015) were ignored 
and neither case was even referred to in the case of Sami Ullah Baloch ; all 
the more surprising since it was heard by a smaller five -member Ben ch as 
opposed to the larger Bench es, respectively of seventeen and seven judges,

13 Ibid., pp. 293 -306. Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 13
just a few years earlier . The judgment in  the case of  Sami Ullah Baloch  
(2018) set out what  it was deciding , as under:  
‘All these connected matters seek a common relief, namely, an 
authoritative pronouncement about the effect of provisions of 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan (“Constitution”) . The crucial question raised is 
whether the inc apacity imposed by Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution upon a person interested to contest an election to 
a seat in the National Assembly or Senate (“Parliament”), is  of 
perpetual effect if there is a declaration against him by a 
Court to the effect that he lacks sagacity or righteousness or is 
profligate or is dishonest or is not Ameen  (untrustworthy). 
This question is posed because Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution does not stipulate the duration of incapacitation 
of a judgment debtor under a judicial  declaration on one or 
more of the aforementioned grounds for contesting an election 
to a seat in Parliament. ’14 
 
And, t he Sami Ullah Baloch  case proceeded to decide : 
‘… that the incapacity created for failing to meet the 
qualifications under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution 
imposes a permanent bar which remains in effect so long as 
the declaratory judgment supporting the conclusion of one of 
the delinquent kinds of conduct under Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution remains in effect. ’15 
 
It is not clear what was meant by the aforesaid words – so long as the 
declaratory judgment … remains in effect . These words become inexplicable 
when a final decision  had been given by this Court. Probably , to clarify this 
ambiguity Sh. Azmat Saeed, J added a separa te concurring opinion  stating 
‘that lack of qualification suffered under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution is 
in perpetuity. ’ 16 
 
Section 232(2) of t he Elections Act , 2017  
 
18. To redress the unexpected interpretation of Article 62(1)(f)  of the 
Constitution , and the consequence s derived thereof , Parliament added 
section 232(2)  to the Elections Act . It legislated that the disqualification  
under Artic le 62(1)(f) shall be for a period not exceeding five years  and that 
section 232(2) will prevail over any decision of the Supreme Court , which 
would include the  decision in the  case of Sami Ullah Baloch . Section 232(2) 
of the Elections Act which has not been challenged before this Court nor 
was it challenged after publication of the above mentioned Public Notice s 
meaning thereby that neither any political party nor any citizen wanted to 
contest it.

Fundamental Rights in the Constitution  
 
 
19. Article 8(2) of the Constitution provides that ‘ The State shall not make 
any law which takes away or abridges the rights’ conferred by or recognised 
as Fundamental Rights .17 The Fundamental Right incorporated in Article 
17(2) entitles a citizen to ‘ form or b e a member of a political party’ . This 
Court ha s held that Article 17(2) include s the right to participate in the 
political process and to contest elections  in the case s of Benazir Bhutto v 
Federation of Pakistan18 and Javed Jabbar v Federation of P akistan ,19 where 
this Court held , that:  
‘[The] right to  contest an election is not only a statutory but 
also a fundamental right conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of 
the Constitution … Such right is guaranteed under Article 17(2) 
of the Constitution and has been recognized as such in Mian 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan  PLD 1993 SC 
473 and Pakistan Muslim League (Q) v. Chief Executive of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan  PLD 2002 SC 994.’  
   
More recently , in the case of Election Commission v Pakistan Tehreek -e-
Insaf , 20 it was held , that: 
‘The Fundamental Right enshrined in  Article 17(2) of the 
Constitution secures the right to form political parties. If  
members of political parties are not allowed to participate in 
intra-party  elections, their Fundamental Right of putting 
themselves forward as  candidates, contesting elections and 
voting for the candidates of their  choice is violated. To hold 
otherwise would render Article 17(2) of the  Constitution, and 
the judgment in the case of Benazir Bhutto v Federation  of 
Pakistan  case, meaningless and inef fective. ’ 
 
20. The decision in the  Sami Ullah Baloch  categorized Article 17(2) and 
Article 62(1)(f)  to have ‘ equal standing ’.21 With respect  we do not agree that 
both have equal standing . Article 17(2) of the Constitution is a 
Fundamental Right whereas Article 62 prescribes who is qualified to 
contest elections. If any provision of the Constitution has the effect of 
curtailing or abridg ing any Fundamental Right it must not be interpreted to 
undermine the Fundamental Right s. Clauses (d), (e) , (f) and (g) of Article 
62(1) of the Constitution do not state that the disqualification of a 
candidate  will be permanent. If clause (f) of Article 62(1) of the Constitution 
is read to mean that it imposes a permanent or lifetime disqualif ication 
then clauses (d), (e) and (g) too can be interpreted in like manner. Applying

the decision in the case of Sami Ullah Baloch  would mean that anyone 
working against the integrity of the country  or opposed  to the ideology of 
Pakistan  would be disquali fied for life, which would conflict with clause (g) 
of Article 63(1) which only disqualifi es for a period of five years  from the 
date the offender  has served out his imprisonment.  The decision in Sami 
Ullah Baloch  has rendered two provisions of the Constitution contradictory 
and irreconcilable. If Parliamentarian s wanted to permanently disqualify 
those not compliant with the provisions of Article 62(1) (d), (e), (f) or (g) they 
did not state this . Neither t he High C ourts nor the Supreme Court can 
rewrite any law, much less the Constitution , nor can they insert anything 
therein. The Constitution was carefully crafted by its framers and the 
domain s of the Judiciary and that of the Legislature  were kept separate. 
The Hi gh Courts and the Supreme Court may strike down any law which is 
unconstitutional, but they are not empowered to legislate .  
 
21. The decision in Sami Ullah Baloch  had equate d a declaration made by 
a court of civil jurisdiction , with regard  to civil rights  and obligations , with 
a declaration  to be made under clause (f) of Article 62(1) of the Constitution . 
The law does not empower a court to make a negative declaration with 
regard to any of the matters mentioned in the said clause (f), that is, to 
declare that someone is not sagacious, is not righteous, is profligate, is 
dishonest or is not ameen . The Constitution does not even disqualify a 
criminal permanently from contesting elections , either under clause (g) or 
clause (h) of Article 63 (1), therefore, it does not then stand to reason that 
indeterminate matters in respect of which opinions may vary - good 
character , sagacity , righteous ness and honesty  - the disqualification would 
be permanent.  
 
22. Judges do not have the ability to adjudicate indeterminate matter s of 
morality , nor are able to bifurcate morality  from immorality , virtue from 
vice, and then proceed to meticulously weigh them . And, even if they could 
would the scale used in measuring morality always give the same reading. 
Human characteristics and qualities seldom remain static ; they change 
even during the course of a single day. Only once a life has been lived out 
and death has intervene d can an opinion be expressed  with some certainty , 
and then too only to the extent of what is publicly known  about a person. 
The good character  of an intensely private altruist will be just as unknown 
as the bad character  of an undetected criminal. Someone devoid of the 
virtues and qualities of Article 6 2(1)(d), (e) and (f) may also come to acquire 
them or possessing them proceed to lose them. And who adjudicates would 
also matter ; one Judge may consider that someone is of good character , etc. Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 16
but another may have the opposite opinion.  Matters which are mentioned 
in clauses (d), (e)  and (f) of Article 62(1)  are inherently subjective , and may 
also change .  Earthly judges should adjudicate those matters which are 
discernible , determinable  and which the law clearly expounds , and avoid 
the domain  of Heaven.  
 
23. The decision in the Sami Ullah Baloch  case did not consider , that 
which was observed by a seventeen -member Bench in the case of Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan , that Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution is not self -
executory , nor attended to the questions formulated by the seven -member 
Bench in the case of Ishaq Khan Khakwani , and disregarded what a learned 
Judge22 had held, which was that a court cannot give a declaration with 
regard to whether a person  is sagacious, righteou s, non-profliga te, honest 
and ameen. The decision in the case of Sami Ullah Baloch  also did not 
consider that Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution does not: (1) specify the  
court of law  that is required to make the declaration , (2) does not provide  
the procedure for making the declaration and (3) does not specify the period 
for which the disqualification is incurred . Whether clauses (d) , (e) and (f) of 
Article 62(1) were m erely aspirational  was also not considered . 
 
Constitutional construction and interpretation in favour of the citizen  
 
24. It may also validly be questioned , that when the Constitution does 
not prescribe permanent disqualification in respect of far more serious 
matters then , with regard to lesser matters and/or with regard to 
misdeclaration(s) in nomination papers , why would it prescribe permanent 
disqualification. The Sami Ullah Baloch  case (in its paragraph 31) lauded 
the limited period of disqualification for those release d from jail:  
 
‘It is in this context that one should look at the disqualification 
under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution for a limited period of 
five years imposed upon a convict after his release from jail. 
Even so, with the limited period of his dis qualification as an ex -
convict for offences involving moral turpitude, he still carries 
the odium of his past conviction before the voters in his 
constituency, whose hearts and minds he has yet to win. An ex  
convict suffers huge handicaps to find dignity a nd acceptance 
for himself in society. The notable effort by the Constitution to 
allow him an opportunity to reform himself and to strive for 
such a position in society cannot be deprecated for providing 
him relief rather than longer disenfranchisement. ’ 
 
The aforesaid reason, which was given in support of attracting permanent 
disqualification, eludes us. It is not comprehensible why those convicted of 
                                                
22 Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J in  Ishaq Khan Khakwani  case, p. 303.   Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 17
criminal offences, including violent or sexual offences, should be provided 
an opportunity to win the heart s and minds  of voters but not those 
disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) for something for less significant. An d, the 
empathy expressed for ex -convicts though commendable should not be a 
factor in interpreting the Constitution.   
 
25. Courts of law deal wit h tangible concepts , and if a law or a 
constitutional provision is vague, it has to be interpreted as per well -
established rules of construction , in favo ur of the citizen . Courts  should 
crystaliz e ambiguities and avoid leaning into them . If the Constitution 
leaves a matter indeterminate or vague it does not mean that jurisdiction 
and authority has been confe rred upon the Courts . Moreover, i n the 
absence of an  objective  standard, judges would be left to decide cases as 
per their individua l preferences and varying perceptions of morality. If this 
is allowed it would be destructive of a clearly defined constitutional and 
legal order  in which the Fundamental Rights of fair trial and due process , 
stipulated in Article 10A of the Constitution , would stand negated . Applying 
different standards would also negate equal treatment as mandated by 
Article 25(1) of the Constitution.  
 
Intent of Parliament   
 
26. Clauses (d) to (g) were added to Ar ticle 62(1) of the Constitution  by 
the Revival of the Constitution of 1973 Order  when the Constitution was in 
abeyance and abrogated. When two interpretations are possible the one 
which accords with the text of the original Constitution is to be preferred  to 
changes made to it during the period of one -man rul e. Insertions made into 
the Constitution by an individual do not have the credibility and 
weightiness of those made by the elected representatives of the people, and 
cannot possibly be equated with the intent of Parliament; as expressed in 
The Judge in a D emocracy :  
‘For statutes enacted during the undemocratic period, little 
weight should be attached to the intention of the undemocratic 
legislature. Indeed, consideration of legislative intent in 
statutory interpretation is based on the need to give express ion 
to the intent of the democratic  legislator.  When a legislator is 
not democratic, there is no reason to give expression to his 
intent ’.23 
 
International standards  
 
27. The Sami Ullah Baloch  judgment relied upon the Code of Conduct for  
Members of Parliament  in the United Kingdom and on it s basis sought to 
                                                
23Aharon Barak, ‘The Judge in a Democracy’ (Princeton 2006) 125 -126.  Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 18
demonstrate that Article 62(1)(f) reflects ‘ the universality of standards of 
honorable conduct in public life in the contemporary democratic world’ . 
However, it neglected to mention that breaches of the Code of Conduct for 
Members of Parliament  do not stipulate disqualification  from contesting 
elections under any circumstances , let alone permanent disqualification. In 
the event that a Member of the British Parliament does not resign when a 
breach o f conduct is proven, sanctions may follow which may include, 
public apology,  mandatory training or suspension.24 Even in the extreme 
and rare case of expulsion from the House does not prevent one to contest 
elections and represent the constituency if re-elected.25 This Court , 
however , set a standard f ar higher than any other in the world, and did so 
by reading words into the Constitution . The learned Mr. Faisal Siddiqui in 
his amicus brief , having researched the matter , wrote that, ‘ there is no 
example in comparative history where honesty has been engineered in 
politics through the judicial process ’.  
 
28. Pakistan is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which provides:  
‘25. Every citizen shall have the right and the 
opportu nity, without any of the distinctions mentioned 
in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:  
 
(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, 
directly or through freely chosen representatives;  
 
(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic 
elections, which shall be by universal and equal 
suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, 
guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the 
electors;  
 
(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to 
public service in his country.’  
 
 The UN Human Rights Committee in its interpretation of the above 
Article 25 of the Covenant has held: ‘ The exercise of these rights by citizens 
may not be suspended or excluded on grounds which are established by law 
and which are objective and reasonable ’.  
 
Reference s to the Holy Qur’an  
 
29. The decision in  the Sami Ullah Baloch  case quoted Qur ’anic passages  
(Al-Ahzab  (3), verse 21 and Yusuf  (12) verse 54-55) and sought to make a

connection  therewith . The decision incomprehensibly stated that the Holy 
Qur’an recognizes the ‘ temporal significance of the character qualities 
specified in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution ’. However , ‘No exegete of the 
Qur’an has interpreted these verses to mean that they are a condition for 
appointing a person to public office.  They only set certain standards that 
people should aspire to attain .’26 The renowned jurist Imam Abu al -Hasan 
‘Ubaydullah al -Karkhi27 mentions the basic presumption of Islamic law in 
the following words: ‘The affairs of the Muslims are to be construed as 
upright and proper, unless the contrary is established. ’28 The illustrious 
jurist Imam Abu Hamid Muhammad al -Ghazali29 goes a step further  in his 
famous monograph Al-Iqtisad fi al -I‘tiqad  (Moderation in Belief ) and devotes 
a whole chapter to the qualification s and conditions for a Muslim ruler, but 
states that the lack of these qualities would not delegitimize the ruler.30  
 
30. The Sami Ullah Baloch  case also mentioned the concept of forgiveness 
(touba  and maghfirat ) but then did not attend to the matter of for giveness, 
let alone how and when it would be applicable. Several Qur’anic verses31 
and Prophetic traditions32 promise great reward for those who show 
remorse after commi tting a sin or crime and repent but these were not 
considered. On the contrary the decision condemned a potential candidate 
in perpetuity, and shut the door to forgiveness and redemption, and did so 
by exceeding the limits prescribed in the Holy Qur’an.33   
 
Sami Ullah Baloch decision was not followed later by its author  
 
31. The learned  Umar Ata Bandial, J had written the main judgment in 
the Sami Ullah Baloch  case but in cases which he subsequently decided he 
did not apply the ratio of Sami Ullah Baloch . In the case of Allah Dino Khan 
Bhayo v Election Commission of Pakistan34 the learned Judge sought to 
dilute his earlier verdict by holding that since in the Allah Dino  Khan Bhayo  
case the determination/disqualification was not by a court of law  but by a 
returning officer, the qualification of the candidate under Article 62(1)( f)

was not permanent.  His lordship further held that , ‘the finding given by the 
Returning Officer in the present case was rendered in 2007 prior to the 
amendment in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution .’ The referred to amendment 
was the Eighteenth Amendme nt to the Constitution which had inserted the 
words – ‘there being no declaration to the contrary by a court of law ’. 
However, if this reasoning is applied then it would follow that all those who 
had been disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) prior to the Ei ghteenth 
Amendment , in the  absence of the said words (inserted pursuant to the 
Eighteenth Amendment ), disqualification was not permissible . The 
alternative interpretation would be that  the Eighteenth Amendment had 
weaponised Article 62(1)(f) , which would be the exact opposite of what 
Parliament had intended , and had done.   
 
32. In yet another decision, in the case of Muhammad Faisal V awda v 
Election Commission of Pakistan ,35 Umar Ata Bandial, J also did not abide 
by the ratio of Sami Ullah Bal och. The Muhammad Faisal V awda case did 
not require the interpretation of indeterminate language used in Article 
62(1)(f). The petitioner had been elected as a Senator in Pakistan while he 
was a citizen of the United States of America . Article 62(1)(a) of the 
Constitution mandates that a candidate for elections , including to the 
Senate of Pakistan,  must be ‘ a citizen of Pakistan ’, which provision has 
always existed in the Constitution and has never undergone a change. The 
petitioner -Sena tor expressed ‘ regret ’ and resigned from his senate seat . 
Nonetheless, t his Court  not only excused the transgression of the 
Constitution but also declared ‘ that the petitioner shall not be considered 
disqualified in any subsequent election .’ The confidence of the people is 
undermined in the judicial process when decision s rendered on the same 
provision of the Constitution are difficult to reconcile . 
 
Conclusion  
 
33. For the aforesaid reasons  and with great respect we have no option 
but to hold that the decision in the case of Sami Ullah Baloch  does not 
conform to the Constitution and overrule  it. The determination in the case 
of Sami Ullah Baloch  and in all those cases in which the returning officers, 
election tribunals, the High Courts and  this Court had issued declarations  
pursuant to Article 62(1) (f) of the Constitution and held such 
disqualification to be permanent  are not sustainable . Parliament has 
enacted  section 232(2) in the Elections  Act, stipulating that disqualification

under Article 62(1)(f) cannot exceed five years, and there is no need to 
examine its validity in the present case . 
 
34. The aforesaid are the reasons for the order dated 8 January 2024, 
reproduced hereunder:  
‘ORDER OF THE COURT  
For the reasons to be recorded later and subject to amplifications and 
explanations made therein, by a majority of 6 to 1 (Yahya Afridi, J. dissenting), it is 
decided and declared that:  
i. Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic Repub lic of Pakistan 
(“Constitution ”) is not a self -executory provision as it does not by itself 
specify the court of law that is to make the declaration mentioned therein 
nor does it provide for any procedure for making, and any period for 
disqualification inc urred by, such declaration.  
ii. There is no law that provides for the procedure, process and the 
identification of the court of law for making the declaration mentioned in 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and the duration of such a declaration, 
for the pur pose of disqualification thereunder, to meet the requirements of 
the Fundamental Right to a fair trial and due process guaranteed by Article 
10A of the Constitution.  
iii. The interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution in imposing a 
lifetime disquali fication upon a person through an implied declaration of a 
court of civil jurisdiction while adjudicating upon some civil rights and 
obligations of the parties is beyond the scope of the said Article and 
amounts to reading into the Constitution.  
iv. Such readi ng into the Constitution is also against the principle of 
harmonious interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution as it 
abridges the Fundamental Right of citizens to contest elections and vote for 
a candidate of their choice enshrined in Article 17  of the Constitution, in the 
absence of reasonable restrictions imposed by law.  
v. Until a law is enacted to make its provisions executory, Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution stands on a similar footing as Article 62(1)(d), (e) and (g), and 
serves as a guid eline for the voters in exercising their right to vote.  
vi. The view taken in Sami Ullah Baloch v Abdul Karim Nausherwani (PLD 2018 
SC 405) treating the declaration made by a court of civil jurisdiction 
regarding breach of certain civil rights and obligations as a declaration 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and making such 
declaration to have a lifelong disqualifying effect amounts to reading into 
the Constitution and is therefore overruled.  
vii. Section 232(2) added in the Elections Act, 2017,  vide the Elections 
(Amendment) Act, 2023 promulgated on 26 June 2023, prescribes a period 
of five years for the disqualification incurred by any judgment, order or 
decree of any court in terms of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and has 
also made such  declaration subject to the due process of law. This provision 
is already in field, and there remains no need to examine its validity and 
scope in the present case.  
2. Consequently, the present civil appeals and petitions are decided in the 
following terms : 
i. Civil Appeal No. 982/2018  is allowed to the extent of the appellant’s 
disqualification to contest elections on the ground stated in the impugned Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.  
 
 22
order of the Lahore High Court, dated 6 July 2018, passed in Writ Petition 
No. 22429/2018, which to that extent is set aside;  
ii. Civil Appeal No. 984/2018 , which has impugned the order of the Lahore 
High Court, dated 11 July 2018, passed in Writ Petition No.  222868/2018 
whereby the respondent’s nomination papers were ordered to be accepted 
and the Returning Officer was directed to include his name (Fazal 
Mehmood) in the list of eligible candidates, is dismissed;  
iii. Civil Appeal No. 880/2015 , which has impugned  the judgment of the 
Election Tribunal, Multan, Punjab, dated 21 August 2015, whereby the 
election of the appellant (Ch. Muhammad Arif Hussain) as returned 
candidate in respect of General Elections held on 11 May 2013 was declared 
as void and the Election Co mmission of Pakistan was directed to hold fresh 
elections which were held and the term of the said assemblies has expired, 
is disposed of as having become infructuous;  
iv. Civil Appeal No. 1946/2023 , which has impugned the order of the High 
Court of Sindh, dat ed 19 October 2023, passed in Constitution Petition No. 
1082/2023 whereby the appellant’s prayer for declaring him to be eligible to 
contest the upcoming elections was disposed of with the observation that 
the same would be decided at the appropriate stage  if his nomination 
papers were rejected, is disposed of in view of the above declarations; and  
v. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2680/2023  is converted into an 
appeal and allowed to the extent of the appellant’s disqualification to 
contest elections on the ground stated in the impugned order of the Lahore 
High Court, dated 4 May 2023, passed in Writ Petition No. 27043/2023, 
which to that extent is set aside.  
3. Learned Syed Ali Imran, the Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar 
Association (‘ SCBA ’), state d that the SCBA sought to withdraw C.M. Appeal No. 
22/2022  and Constitution Petition filed in 2022, which was under objection and 
not numbered, therefore, the said appeal and petition are dismissed as withdrawn. 
Civil Appeals No. 981 & 985/2018, CM Appeal No. 135/2022 in C.P. No. 
NIL/2022  and Constitution Petition No. 40 of 2022  are de -listed, which shall be 
posted for hearing separately before appropriate Benches.

Yahya Afridi, J.  - With profound respect, I disagree. For reasons to follow, the 
extent of lack of qualification of a member of the Parliament, as envisaged under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is neither 
lifelong nor permanent, and the same shall remain effective only during the period 
the declaration so made by a Court of law remains in force. Therefore, the 
conclusion so drawn by this Court in Sami Ullah Baloch Versus Abdul Karim 
Nousherwani (PLD 2018 SC 405)  is legally valid, hence affirmed.

Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. -  
Preface  
Elections play a critical role in democracies, serving as the primary 
mechanism through which citizens exercise their right to choose their 
leaders and influence government policies. Elections encourage civic 
participation and engagement, allowing citizens to be part of the 
decision -making process that affects their lives. Elections confer 
legitimacy on a government by providing a transparent and systematic 
method for the transfer of p ower. This legitimacy is crucial for the 
stability and functioning of a democratic society.   
2. How disqualification s to contest  elections are viewed, touch on the 
core values of dem ocratic governance, rule of law  and individual rights.  
Disqualifying a candidate from contesting elections  should be viewed by 
courts with caution  and circumspection,  recognizing it as a severe 
restriction on the democratic right  to vote and contest elections. 
Ddisqualification  must be based in law, not on surmises or inferen ces. 
This principle ensures that disqualificati on is applied uniformly, fairly  
and transparently, in accordance with established legal standards rather 
than arbitrary decisions.  Character  of a candidate should generally not 
be judged by courts in the absen ce of specific laws dictating such criteria 
for eligibility. In democracies, the assessment of a candidate's character 
is primarily a matter for the voters to consider based on the information 
available to them. In democratic societies, the emphasis is on ensuring 
that the electoral process remains open, fair  and reflective of the society's 
values, rather than allowing judicial or governmental overreach to dictate 
the outcomes of elections or to unduly influence the eligibility of 
candidates based on subjec tive criteria.    
3. Electoral laws typically rely on objective, verifiable criteria for 
disqualification, such as age, citizenship, criminal convictions, etc. These 
criteria can be directly verified through official documents or public 
records, based on tangible evidence. This ensures that disqualification 
decisions are grounded in concrete facts rather than subjective opinions.  
Assessing qu alities like character, ho nesty  or religious knowledge is 
inherently subjective and can vary significantly depending on the 
evaluator's perspectives, biases, or cultural background. Establishing 
uniform standards for such qualities is practically impossible and legally 
contentious.  Given these considerations, electoral laws and practices 3 
 
generally avoid subjective criteria for disqualification, focusing instead on 
objective, verifiable standards.  
4. With this unders tanding of the imp ortance of elections in a 
democracy and of the rights of citizens to contest elections and vote for 
the candidate s of their choice, we approach and deal  with the question  
involved in the present cases. Further , we are guided by two principles: 
First, the judges have nothing to do with shades of public opinion or with 
passions of the day that sway public opinion; their task is to tenaciously 
and fiercely uphold and implement the Constitution and the law.1 They 
are not to make efforts to win accolades from the public but to simply 
decide the matters prese nted before them in accordance with the 
Constitution and the law.2 Second, the courts are to construe the 
fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution progressively and 
liberally,3 but the provisions whether in the Constitution or in any law 
that curt ail or limit the fundamental rights are to be construed 
restrictively and narrowly;4 for the fundamental rights guaranteed in a 
Constitution are the heart and soul of the Constitution.    
Interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and revisiting  of Sami 
Ullah Baloch   
5. The facts of the present cases are somewhat different from each 
other, which shall be described later, but they have given rise to a 
common question as to the interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (“Constitution”)  and 
reconsideration of the construction put to the provisions thereof by a 
five-member  Bench of this Court in Sami Ullah Baloch v. Abdul Karim 
Nousherwani  (PLD 2018 SC 405) .  
6. Since the whole matter revolves around t he provisions of Article 
62(1)(f) , they are cited at the outset  for reading and reference:  
62. (1) A person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a 
member of Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) unless - 
… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … …  … … … …  
(f) he is sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen, there 
being no declaration to the contrary by a court of law ; 
(Emphasis added)

2 Justice Qazi Faez Isa v. President of Pakistan PLD 2021 SC 1 per Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.  
3 Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan PLD 1993 SC 473 and Justice Qazi Faez  Isa v. President of Pakistan 
2022 SCP 140 per Maqbool Baqar, J., et al.  
4 Benazir Bhutto v.  Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 SC 416;  Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi  v. Returning Officer 1994 
SCMR 1299  and Wukala Mahaz Barai Thafaz Dastoor  v. Federation of Pakistan PL D 1998 SC 1263 . 4 
 
A bare reading of Article 62(1)(f) shows that the qualification of being 
sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen  is presumed to be 
fulfilled by every person unless there is a declaration against him or her 
to the contrary by a court of law. The matter of interpretation of Article 
62(1)(f ), therefore , begs answers  to the following questions  raised  in Ishaq 
Khakwani5, which have slightly been rephrased for precision and clarity:   
(i) Which c ourt is competent to make the declaration  
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) ? 
 
(ii) Who has  locus standi  to seek such declaration?  
 
(iii) What is  the procedure for making such  declaration , and 
is Art icle 10A of the Constitution attracted in making 
such declaration ? 
 
(iv) What is the standard of proof required for making such 
declaration ?  
Ishaq Khakwani left these questions to be addressed in some other 
‘appropriate case ’ while Sami Ullah Baloch  provided  the answer  only to 
the first question  which  has, with respect, instead of resolving the 
question added a further complicat ion. Having  the invaluable assistance 
of numerous distinguished lawyers, we are of  the opinion that this is  the 
‘appropriate c ase’ in which the above  questions sho uld be considered 
and addressed . Therefore, we undertake to do so.  
Question (i): Which court is  competent to make the declaration 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f)?  
7. Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution though mentions a declaration to 
be made by a ‘court of law’ that a person is not sagacious, righteous, non -
profligate, honest and ameen , it does not specify which court from among 
the several courts of law will be competent  to make such declaration as 
all courts established by the Constitution or any law in terms of Article 
175(1) of the Constitution are the ‘courts of law’.  Different Benches of 
this Court have, therefore, been endeavouring to identify the ‘court of 
law’ whi ch is com petent to make such declaration .  Some instances of 
such endeavours are cited and discussed hereunder:  
                                                             
5 Ishaq Khakwani v. Nawaz Sharif PLD 2015 SC 275 (7MB).  5 
 
Judicial definitions of the expressions ‘declaration’ and ‘court of law’ 
as used in Article 62(1)(f)  
7.1. In Aftab Ahmad ,6 a three -member Bench of this Court  observed  
that the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f)  can possibly be made by 
the Retuning Officer or the Appellate Tribunal in appeal arising from the 
order of the Returning Officer accepting or rejecting the nomination 
paper , but it cannot be made in writ j urisdiction  under Article 199 of the 
Constitution by the High Courts  when there is a factual controversy 
involved.  The relevant extract is reproduced for ready reference:   
12. …… This means that the declaration, determination and a djudication 
of a person falling within the mischief of the noted Article [62(1)(f)] by 
appropriate forum is a pre -requisite. Such determination in appropriate 
cases can also be possible though the medium of Retuning Officer or the 
appeal arising therefrom,  but it can hardly be agreed if it should be 
straight away done in the Writ Jurisdiction when there is a factual 
controversy involved.  
Both the se statements made in Aftab Ahmad  were dissented from, 
though without reference to Aftab Ahmad  in later cases.  
7.2. In Murad Ali Shah ,7 a three -member Bench of this Court negated 
the statement made in Aftab Ahmad , though without referring thereto,  
that the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) can be made by the 
Retuning Officer, by holding that the declaration given by a Returning 
Officer, who is not a court of law, while rejecting nomination paper in 
summary proceedings is not a declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) of 
the Const itution. The relevant extract from Murad Ali Shah  is 
reproduced : 
9.  ….. In the present case, the only declaration against the respondent 
under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution was given in summary 
proceeding s by the Returning Officer  on 06.04.2013. As already noted 
above, no evidence was recorded by the Returning Officer to sustain his 
finding nor he recorded reasons for invoking disqualification under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. He is not a Court of law  but a 
statutory forum of limited jurisdiction. Therefore, the condition that only 
a Court of law can issue a d eclaration of disqualification under Article 
62(1)(f) of the Constitution is not met in the present case.  
(Emphasis added)  
 
The same view was reiterated in Allah Dino Bhayo8. While t he second 
statement made in Aftab Ahmad,  that the declar ation mentioned in 
Article 62(1) (f) cannot be made in writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of 
                                                             
6 Aftab Ahmad v. Muhammad Ajmal PLD 2010 SC 1066 (3MB).  
7 Roshan Ali Buriro v. Murad Ali Shah 2019 SCMR 1939 (3MB).  
8 Allah Dino Bhayo v. Election Commission of Pakistan PLD  2020 SC 591 (3MB).  6 
 
the Constitution by the High Courts when there is a factual controversy 
involved, was reversed in Sher Alam9 by holding  that such declaration 
can be made in constitutional jurisdi ction of the High Courts and this 
Court under Article 199 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution 
respectively, by holding thus:  
18. …. [W]here unqualified or disqualified person manages to escape 
through the net [under the ROPA of 1976] and trespass into t he Majlis -e-
Shoora or the Provincial Assembly, the Constitutional jurisdiction of the 
learned High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution and of this 
Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution can always be invoked.  
7.3. In the well -known Panama case,10 the majority of a five -member 
Bench of this Court also attempted to give a judicial definition to the 
expression ‘court of law’ used in Article 62(1)(f) as under:  
20. … The expression “a court of law” has not been defined in Article 62 
or any other  provision of the Constitution but it essentially means a 
court of plenary jurisdiction, which has the power to record evidence and 
give a declaration on the basis of the evidence so recorded. Such a court 
would include a court exercising original, appella te or revisional 
jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases.  
The Panama case , thus, identified the ‘court of law’ mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f)  as a ‘court of plenary jurisdiction’, which has the power to record 
evidence and give a declaration on the basis o f the evidence so recorded , 
and further explained that such court includes a court exercising 
original, appellate or revisional jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases.  
The notable  point is that the Panama case  included in the definition of a 
‘court of law’ not only the court s exercising ‘civil jurisdiction ’ but also the 
courts exercising ‘criminal jurisdiction ’; which statement, as mentioned 
herein later, was negated by Sami Ullah Baloch . Although the Panama 
case did not explain how this Court  while exercising its original 
jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution is a ‘court of plenary 
jurisdiction’, it proceeded to determine the matter of qualification of a 
person (the respondent therein) under Article 62(1)(f) by assuming that 
this Court is a court of ‘plenary jurisdiction’ while exercising its original 
jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The Panama case  
thus also negated the statement made in Aftab Ahmad,  that the 
declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) canno t be made in writ 
jurisdiction when there is a factual controversy involved, by proceeding 
to determine the disputed  facts in writ jurisdiction of this Court under 
                                                             
9 Sher Alam v. Abdul Munim PLD 2018 SC 449 (3MB). The same view was reiterated in Shaukat Bhatti v. 
Iftikhar Kiani PLD 2018 SC 578 (3MB).  
10 Imran Khan v. Nawaz Sharif PLD 2017 SC 265 (5MB).  7 
 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution.  Further, t he Bench was perhaps not 
sure of even the definition  provided by itself , as it also mentioned  the 
possibility of making such declaration by the Election T ribunal, in 
addition to the courts of law identified, by observing:  
20. … Returning Officer or any other fora in the hierarchy would not 
reject  the nomination of a person from being elected as a member of 
Parliament unless a court of law has given a declaration that he is not 
sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen. Even the 
Election Tribunal, unless it itself proceeds to give the requisite 
declaration on the basis of the material before it , would not disqualify the 
returned candidate where no declaration, as mentioned above, has been 
given by a court of law.  
(Emphasis added)  
The same uncertain definition of the ‘court of law’ menti oned in Article 
62(1)(f) was reiterated in Allah Dino Bhayo : 
7. …..  [T]he finding given by the Returning Officer in the present case 
was rendered in 2007 prior to the amendment in Article 62(1)( f) of the 
Constitution. Such a finding was not a verdict given after a trial by a 
court of law; namely, for the purposes of this case, an Election Tribunal 
or a Court of plenary jurisdiction .  
(Emphasis added)  
Thus, as per the Panama  case and Allah Dino Bhayo  the court of law 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) means a court of plenary jurisdiction  and 
the Election Tribunal though they do not describe in clear and certain 
terms which courts are the courts of plenary jurisdiction, which aspect 
shall be discussed  herein later.  
7.4. The next important case that also strugg led with the definition of  
the expression ‘ court of law’ used in Article 62(1)(f) is Sami Ullah 
Baloch . Interestingly, the definition given by Sami Ullah Baloch when 
examined closely is found quite different from all the above definitions : 
firstly, it stated that it is a court of ‘civil jurisdiction’, not of criminal 
jurisdiction , that is to make the declaration ; secondly, the declaration 
made by such court involves ‘the breach of a legal duty or obligation 
owed by the candidate for election to another person or the violation of 
the latter’s legal right or privilege’; and thirdly,  such breach of a legal 
duty or obligation warrants  an inference of ‘ [the candidate’s] 
misrepresentation, dishonesty,  breach of trust, fraud, cheating, lack of 
fiduciary duty, conflict of interest, deception, dishonest 
misappropriation, etc. ,’ which through further inference describes him as 
a person who is not  sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and 
ameen  in terms of Article 62(1)(f) . As for the disqualify ing effect of such 8 
 
an inferential declaration by a court of civil jurisdiction,  Sami Ullah 
Baloch  held that the same shall  ‘last for as long as the declaration is in 
force’ and ‘if the declaration by the Court has attained finality, the 
embargo under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution acquires permanent 
effect’. The relevant extract s from  Sami Ullah Baloch  are cited here for 
reference:   
23. … Where a declaration made by a Court of law against a candidate  
for election warrants a conclusion of his misrepresentation, dishonesty, 
breach of trust, fraud, cheating, lack of fiduciary duty, conflict of 
interest, deception, dishonest misappropriation, etc. to be derived from 
such a verdict, then it stands to reaso n that the consequential incapacity 
imposed upon the candidate for election should last for as long as the 
declaration is in force.  
24.  …. [A] valid declaration by the Court would involve the breach of a 
legal duty or obligation owed by the candidate for  election to another 
person or the violation of the latter’s legal right or privilege.  
25.  …. A final decree has binding effect and is commonly described as a 
past and closed transaction having permanent effect. Therefore, the 
consequence of permanent nature i.e. incapacity, following a final and 
binding decree of Court of civil jurisdiction, is the ordinary and lawful 
outcome of civil litigation.  
36. …. [T]he incapacity created for failing to meet the qualifications 
under Article 62(1)(f) of the Consti tution imposes a permanent bar which 
remains in effect so long as the declaratory judgment supporting the 
conclusion of one of the delinquent kinds of conduct under Article 
62(1)(f) of the Constitution remains in effect.  
Thus, as per Sami Ullah Baloch  the declaration mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f) is a declaration made by a court of civil jurisdiction as to the 
commission of misrepresentation, dishonesty, breach of trust, fraud, 
cheating, etc., w hile adjudicating upon an issue arising on a dispute 
between tw o parties regarding the breach of certain civil rights and 
obligations . This definition of the ‘declaration’ and the ‘court of law’ 
contradicts the definition given in the Panama  case and Sher Alam. 
These cases included in those expressions the ‘declarations ’ made by the 
High Courts and this Court in exercise of their jurisdiction under Article 
199 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution  respectively , whereby the legal 
requirements for holding a public office are enforced; n ot the 
adjudication of civil rights and obligations of two private persons as 
observed in Sami Ullah Baloch.   
Analysis of the judicial definitions  
8. We have seen that in several cases, different Benches of this Court 
have been grappling with the problem of ascertaining the tru e meaning 
and scope of the expression s ‘declaration’ and ‘court of law’ as used in 9 
 
Article 62(1)(f) and have come up with different rather divergent 
conclusions . In one case, it is asserted that the Returning Officer can 
make the requisite declaration, while in another, it is stated that, no, he 
cannot. Then, it is asserted that it is a ‘court of plenary jurisdiction’ that 
can make the declaration , which may  be a c ourt of civil jurisdiction or a 
court of criminal jurisdiction. However, the next case maintains  that, no, 
it is only a court of civil jurisdiction that can make the declaration, and 
that too, indirectly, while adjudicating upon the issue of the breach of 
certain civil rights and obligations between tw o parties. At times, it is 
suggested that the Election Tribunal also can make such a declaration, 
in addition to a court of plenary jurisdiction. One case says that the 
requisite declaration cannot be made in writ jurisdiction when there is a 
factual controversy , while the other proceeds to determine the disputed 
facts in writ jurisdiction. With due respect, we observe  that this is not 
the interpretation  of a constitutional provision  but rather is an 
unwarranted reading into the Constitution that amounts to amending 
the Constitution or at best  passes for mere conjectur ing. 
Difference between p rogressive inter pretation and amending the 
Constitution  
9. We are fully cognizant of, and also agree with, the well-settled 
approach of this Court in the matter of interpreting the constitutional 
provisions, i.e., while interpreting constitutional provisions, the judicial 
approach should be dynamic rather than static, pragmatic rather than 
pedantic and elastic rath er than rigid. Courts are to interpret the 
constitutional provisions broadly so that they may meet the requirement s 
of an ever-changing society.11 The doctrine of progressive interpretation, 
which is also referred to as the doctrine of living constitution, is one of 
the means by which the Constitution adapts to the changes in society. 
What this doctrine stipulates is that the meaning of the c onstitution al 
provisions  is not frozen  in time but carries  in it the flexibility  to 
continuously ad apt to new conditions.12 This doctrine is premised on the 
belief that a constitution must be relevant to the society it governs, which

inevitably evolves over time.  With their progressive approach, the courts 
look to the purpose or intent behind a constitutional provision to guide 
its application in modern contexts.  It is a necessary tool for ensuring the 
Constitution remains relevant and capable of protecting the rights of 
citizens and the governmental structure in changing societal context s, 
ensur ing the Constitution remains a living document that evolves 
alongside societal changes.  It is, however, imp ortant to  underline that 
there is  a marked difference between progressive interpretation and 
amendment of the Constitution. By way of progressive interpretation, as 
observed in M.Q.M ,13 “a particular provision, a term or word” of the 
Constitution is “interpreted dynamically and purposively wi th a view to 
achieve the constitutional intent”. Courts cannot , under the disguise of 
progressive interpretation , amend the Constitution  and read that into it 
which is not enshrined in any provision of the Constitution.  Progressive 
interpretation is rooted in constitutional text viewed through a lens of 
contemporary social, eco nomic and political  values but any 
interpretation that does not have any textual mooring  or is not 
entrenched in or flows from any constitutional provision  passes for a  
constit utional amendment by unwarranted reading into the Constitution  
and is beyond the permissible  scope of the judicial act of interpreting the 
Constitution .    
10. With the able assistance rendered at the Bar , we made an earnest 
effort to understand the meaning and scope of th e expressions  
‘declaration’ and ‘court of law’ used in Article 62(1)(f)  both in light of the 
earlier opinions of this Court and independent ly thereof. With respect, we 
are of the considere d opinion that there has been a fundamental error in 
the approach of the Benches that dealt with the question under 
consideration and attempted to determine the ‘court of law’ that has, or 
may have, the jurisdiction to make the ‘declaration ’ mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f), without considering and discussing the provisions of Article 
175(2) of the Constitution.  
Scope of Article 175(2) of the Constitution  
11. Article 175(2) of the Constitution declares it in unequivocal terms 
that no court shall  have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred 
on it by the Constitution or by or under any law.  The opinions of different 
                                                             
13 Province of Sindh v. M.Q.M. PLD 2014 SC 531.  11 
 
Benches of this Court, asserting the competence of various courts to 
make the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) withou t referring to 
any provisions of the Constitution or any law that confers such 
jurisdiction upon those courts, completely lack a legal basis . This 
approach amounts to conferring such jurisdiction on courts by judicial 
decision which is not conferred on them by the Constitution or by or 
under any law in terms of Article 175(2) of the Constitution  and is  thus 
intrinsically unconstitutional . 
12. Any court, including this Court, cannot  by a judicial order confer 
jurisdiction on  itself or any other court, tribunal or authority .14 The 
power to c onfer  jurisdiction is legislative in character ; only the legislature 
possesses  it. No c ourt can create or enlarge its own jurisdiction or any 
other court’s jurisdiction. Nor any court has any inherent or plenary 
jurisdiction. Because of the constitutional command in Article 175(2) of 
the Constitution, the courts in Pakistan do not possess any inherent 
jurisdiction on the basis of some principles of common law, equity or 
good conscience and only have that jurisdiction which is conferred on 
them by the Constitution or by or under any law.15 The s ame is the 
position with the claim of plenary jurisdiction in favour of any court ; no 
court has plenary, i.e., unlimited or indefinite, jurisdiction. Some courts 
may be called the court s of general jurisdiction because of the general 
terms in which the jurisdiction is conferred on them by any law, such as 
the civil courts on which Sect ion 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure 190816 
confers jurisdiction in general terms; but such general jurisdiction is also 
limited and defined in terms of the relevant provisions of the law . 
Therefore, in order to assert  that a particular court has the  jurisd iction 
to make the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) that any person is 
not sagacious, ri ghteous, non -profligate, honest  and ameen , it is 
imperative to identify the provision in the Constitution or under any law 
that confers such jurisdiction.

16 Section 9. Courts to try all Civil Suits unless barred. - The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein cone 
tamed) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizanc e is either 
expressly or impliedly barred.  12 
 
13. The above -discussed cases have held , by espousing  conflicting 
views,  that the Supreme Court, the High Courts, the Election Tribunals, 
and the civil courts have the jurisdiction to make the declaration 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f). The basis and sustainability of their  
finding s need to be examined in terms of the provisions of Article 175(2) 
of the Constitution, i.e., which provisions of the Constitution or any law 
confer such jurisdiction on them.  
No jurisdiction vested in Supreme Court and High Courts to make 
the declaration  
14. First, we take up the matter of competency of the Supreme Court 
and the High Courts to make the said declaration. Some of the  cases that 
so held have refer red to the power of the High Courts to make an order of 
the natur e of a writ of quo warranto  under Article 199(1)(b)(ii)17 and the 
power of the Supreme Court to make an order of the same nature under 
Article 184(3)18 of the Constitution . The basic case they relied  upon for  
this point is Farzand Ali19, decided by a four-member bench of this 
Court.  We have, therefore, minutely examined that case and found that 
the reliance upon it for holding that the declaration mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f) can be made by the High Courts and the Supreme Court in their 
quo warranto  jurisdiction is utterly misplaced.   
15. In Farzand Ali , some Government servants had challenged before 
the High Court  of West Pakistan  in its writ jurisdiction the orders of their 
compulso ry retirement made under the  provisions added in the 1962 
Constitu tion through certain  constitutional amendment s. They had also 
challenged those  constitutional amendment s and collaterally the 
eligibility of some members of the National Assembly who had 
participated in voting for  those amendments . The challenge was based on 
the assertion that those members being lambadar of the villages, 
chairmen of the union councils and reservists of the armed f orces were 
holding offices of profit  in the service of Pakistan and were thereby 
disqualified under Article 103(2)(a) of the 1962 Constitution. The High 
                                                             
17 Article 199. Jurisdiction of High Court .-(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that 
no other adequate remedy is provided by law, —(b) on the application of any person, make an order —(ii) 
requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public offic e to 
show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office.  
18 Article 184. Original Jurisdiction of Supreme Court .- (3) Without prejudice to the pr ovisions of Article 199, 
the Supreme Court shall, if it considers that a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of 
any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of 
the nature mentioned in the said Article.  
19 Farzand Ali v. Province of West Pakistan, PLD 1970 SC 98.  13 
 
Court dismissed their petitions without delving into the question of 
whether the offices held by those members were really the offices of profit 
in the service of Pakistan, holding that this question cou ld not be 
agitated in writ jurisdiction under Article 98 of the 1962 Constitution. On 
appeal , this Court took up and decided the question of examining in writ 
jurisdiction the matter of disqualification of a member of the National 
Assembly . Hamoodur Rahman , C.J., speaking  for the Bench, held:  
[T]he mere fact that the disqualification has been overlooked or what is 
worse, illegally condoned by the authorities who were responsible for 
properly scrutinizing a person's right to be enrolled as a voter or his right 
to be validly nominated for election would not prevent a  person from 
challenging  in the public in terest his r ight to sit in the [H] ouse even after 
his election, if that disqualification is still continuing. Indeed a writ of 
quo warranto  or a proceeding in the nature of info rmation for a quo 
warranto  … is available precisely for such a purpose.20 
The introduction o f election petitions to test the validity of elections and 
statutory provisions for appeals, have no doubt reduced the demand for 
the remedy [of quo warranto ] but have not excluded it altogether.21  
I can see no reason why relief by way of quo warranto  shou ld not be 
available in a case where the remedy by way of an election petition is no 
longer possible or is not the appropriate remedy or the disqualification is 
a continuing one which debars a per son not only from being elected to an 
office but also from holding that office.22 
Although t he Court decided the question of law in the above terms, it 
also, like the High Court,  did not determine the issue of whether the 
offices held by those members were really the offices of profit in the 
service of Pakistan and  they were thereby disqualified under Article 
103(2)(a) of the 1962 Constitution  as the National Assembly had by then 
already dissolved. Rather, the Court dismissed the appeal  by holding that 
the members concerned  were not mere intruders as they had not ac ted 
either mala fide or totally without colo ur of any right or title and that 
their acts were protected not only under Article 110 (1)(d) of the 1962 
Constitution but also on the principle that in collateral proceedings the 
acts of de facto  members of a body cannot be invalidated but must be 
treated as being equivalent to or as good as the acts of de jure  members . 
16. We have  no cavil, but rather agree, to the law declared in Farzand 
Ali that in a case where the disqualification is a continuing one w hich 
debars a perso n not only from being elected  but also from  continuing to 
hold t he office of a member of Parliament and where the remedy by way

21 Ibid, p. 113.  
22 Ibid, p. 114.  14 
 
of an election petition is no longer possible, the remedy of writ of quo 
warranto  remains available. We, with respect, only disagree as to using 
the power to issue a  writ of quo warranto , i.e., to make an order in terms 
of Article 199(1)(b)(ii), by first creating a disqualification through making 
a declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) and then applyi ng that 
disqualification to  declare the person  as disqualified to hold the office of 
a member of Parliament.   
Scope of quo warranto proceedings  
17. A quo warranto  proceeding , in terms of Article 199(1)(b)(ii), involves  
a judicial i nquiry in which the  person  holding a public  office  is called 
upon to  show under what authority of law he holds that  office . In 
essence, through  such proceeding  the appointment  or election  of a 
person  to a public  office  is challenged on the ground  that the same has 
not been made  in accordance with the law, which may include that he 
does not fulfill the qualification  or suffers  from any disqualification 
prescribed  by the law . On this challenge, t he scope of inquiry extends  to 
examining  whether the person holdin g a public office fulfills the required 
qualifications or suffers from any disqualification prescribed by the law 
for holding such office . A quo warranto  proceeding, thus, seeks to ensure 
that the person holding a public office does so in accordance with the 
law, including the fulfilment of the qualification prescribed therein for 
holding that office. It is not a medium to  first create  a disqualification  
and then apply  that disqualification  to the person holdi ng the office for 
making him ineligible to hold the  office.  Rather, its purpose is to examine 
only existing disqualifications or lack of qualifications that may render a 
person ineligible for holding the office he currently holds.  
18. Therefore,  in a quo warranto  proceed ing the disqualification of a 
person holding the office of a member of Parliament cannot be created by 
making a ‘declaration’ in such proceeding in terms of Article 62(1)(f) that 
he is not sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen ;  just as 
his disqualification cannot be c reated , in such proceeding,  by ‘convicting ’ 
him for an offence involving moral turpitude in terms of Artic le 63(1)(h) of 
the Constitution . In a quo warranto  proceeding, the scope of judicial 
inquiry as to qualification prescribed in Arti cle 62(1)(f)  is lim ited to see 
whether or not there is a ‘declaration ’ by a ‘court of law ’ of competent 
jurisdiction against a member of Parliament that has declared that he is 15 
 
not sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen. If the court , 
exercising quo warranto  jurisdiction , finds that there exists such a 
declaration , either before or after his election , rendering him  disqualified 
from holding the office of a member of Parliament, it shall declare that 
the office is not held by him under the authority of law , and 
consequently, the office is vacant, to be filled in accordance with the law. 
But if the court finds that there exis ts no such declaration, it will  drop 
the proceeding. In no way can the court proceed to make the ‘declaration’ 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f ) itself in exercise of its quo warranto  
jurisdiction.  Therefore, in quo warranto  proceedings the Supreme Court 
and the High Courts do not have the jurisdiction  to make the 
‘declaration ’ mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.  
No jurisdiction vested in Election  Tribunals to make the declaration  
19. Next, we examine whether the Election Tribunals have the 
jurisdiction to make the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f). The 
Election Tribunals are not constitutional bodies but rather are statutory 
bodies, which are established under an Act of Parliament enacted in 
pursuance to Article 225 read with Article 222 of the Constitution. In 
this regard, t he law for the time being in force is the Elections Act 2017.  
The Election Tribunals are esta blished by the Election Commission 
under Section 14023 of the Elections Act for the trial of election petitions 
under the said Act, whereas the scope of jurisdiction of the Election  
Tribunals in relation to election petitions is defined in Section 154, whic h 
is reproduced here for ready reference:  
154. Decision of the Election Tribunal. —(1) The Election Tribunal may, 
upon the conclusion of the trial of an election petition, make an order —  
(a) dismissing the petition;  
(b) declaring —  
(i) the election of the  returned candidate to be void and 
directing that fresh poll be held in one or more polling 
stations;  
(ii) the election of the returned candidate to be void and 
the petitioner or any other contesting candidate to have 
been elected; or  
(iii) the election as a whole to be void and directing that 
fresh election be held in the entire constituency.  
(2) Save as provided in section 155, the decision of an Election Tribunal 
on an election petition shall be final.  
                                                             
23 Section 140. Appointment of Election Tribunals. -(1) For the trial of election petitions under this Ac t, the 
Commission shall appoint as many Election Tribunals as may be necessary for swift disposal of electi on 
petitions.  16 
 
A bare reading of the provisions of Sect ion 154 shows that the Election  
Tribunal s have  no jurisdiction to make the ‘declaration’ mentioned in 
Article 62(1)(f) that the returned candidate is not sagacious, righteous, 
non-profligate, honest and ameen. Their jurisdiction is restricted only to 
making the ab ove three declarations , which do not include the 
declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) .  
20. It would also be pertinent to mention  here and also briefly discuss 
the scope of Section 156(1)(b) of the Elections Act, which provides that 
the Election Tribu nals shall declare the election of the returned 
candidate to be void if the returned candidate was not, on the 
nomination day, qualified for, or was disqualified from, being elected as a 
Member. This provision as explicitly mentioned therein relates to the lack 
of qualification or disqualification as existed on the ‘nomination day’, 
which means  that the scope of inquiry in the election petition by the 
Elections Tribunal s is restricted to the existing lack of qualification or 
disqualification and that too, o n the nomination day only .24 If there exists 
no declaration as mentioned  in Article 62(1)(f) against a  returned 
candidate on the nomination day, the Elections Tribunal s cannot 
themselves  make the declaration and apply it to the returned candidate 
retroactively from the ‘nomination day’. Therefore, the Election Tribunals 
also do not have the jurisdiction to make the ‘declaration’ mentioned in 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.  
No jurisdiction vested in civil c ourts to make the declaration  
21. The courts of law that remain to be discussed in relation to their 
asserted competency to make the declaration mention ed in Article 
62(1)(f) are the civil courts.  No doubt, as conferred by Section 9 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure 1908 , the civil courts hav e general jurisdiction to 
try ‘all suits of a civil nature ’ except  those  of which their cognizance is 
either expressly or impliedly barred.  While referring to the explanation of 
Section 9, which says inter alia  that a suit in which the right to an office 
is contested is a suit of a civil nature, it was contended before us that a 
civil court c an try  a suit praying for a declaration as mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f)  as such a suit also involves the right to contest election for the 
                                                             
24 It may be mentioned here for clarity that the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court in quo 
warranto  proceedings extends to lack of qualification or to disqualification that existed on the nomination d ay or 
occurred subsequently, but the jurisdiction of the Elections Tribunals is restricted to lack of qual ification or to 
disqualification that existed on the nomination day .  17 
 
office of a member of Parlia ment . We are afraid, the contention is half 
correct. It is true that Section 9 confers jurisdiction on the civil courts in 
general terms to try ‘all suits o f a civil nature ’ unless their cognizance is 
either expressly or impliedly barred, but it does not grant a substantive 
right of action . The right of action is to be established by reference to 
some substantive law, statutory law or common law. As the ‘suit of a civil 
nature’ is that which involves the enforcement of a ‘civil right’, in order to 
invoke t he general jurisdiction of the civil courts , a person  must have 
such a right under some statute, which for this matter includes the 
Constitution, or under the common law. It is only when such a right 
exists that the  civil courts have the jurisdiction to ta ke cognizance and 
try the suit  involving enforcement of that right .25 In the matter under 
consideration, no provision in the Constitution or any statutory law was 
pointed out to us that confers a right on any person to seek a declaration 
that a nother  person is not sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest 
and ameen. Nor was it even argued , and we may say rightly,  that such a 
right exists in common law. There is at present no such law, neither 
statutory law nor common law, that confers such a civil right on any 
person. Therefore, u ntil any law confers such a civil right the civil courts 
also have no jurisdi ction to try a civil suit filed by a  person, seeking  
against an  other person  a ‘declaration’ as mentioned in Article 62(1)(f ) of 
the Constitution.  
22. The above discussion lead s to the conclusion that the Supreme 
Court, the High Courts,  the Election Tribunals  and the civil courts  do not 
have the jurisdiction to make the declaration mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f). The cases that held otherwise , including Sami Ullah Baloch , have 
not declared the correct law. Not only these courts , we may clarify,  but 
also no other court of law , at present , has such jurisdiction.  
Question (ii): Who has  locus standi  to seek such declaration?  
23. The a nswer to this question, we think, is covered by the discussion 
made above as to the asserted competency of the civil courts to make the 
declaration mention ed in Article 62(1)(f). We have found that  since no 
law, including the Constitution, confers on any p erson a right to seek the 
declaration as mentioned in Article 62(1)(f), the civil courts have no 
jurisdiction to try a suit seeking such declaration. The said finding also 
                                                             
25 Abdur Rahman v. Amir Ali PLD 1978 Lah 113 (DB).  18 
 
answers this question  in terms that as per the existing legal position , no 
person has locus standi  to seek against an other person the declaration 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f).    
Question (iii): What is  the procedure for making such declaration, and is 
Article 10A of the Constitution attracted to making such declaration?  
24. Though we have found that no court of law  is, at pre sent,  
competent to make the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f)  nor is 
there any law that prescribes the procedure for making such declaration, 
we are of the firm opinion that whenever any law confers the right on any 
person  to seek, and the  jurisdiction  on any court of law  to make, the said 
declaration, Article 10A of the Constitution  will definitely stand attract ed 
to the proceedings conducted in exercise of that jurisdiction  for the 
enforcement of that right . Since  any determination made in such 
proceedings shall have the effect of curtailing a  fundamental right26 of 
the person in respect of whom such declaration is sought,  the right to a 
fair trial and due process  guaranteed by Article 10A shall also be 
available to such person.  Aftab Ahmad  and Allah Dino Bhayo  also held 
for applicability of Article 10A to the procedure for making the 
declaration mention ed in Article 62(1)(f). To this extent, we endorse them.  
Question (iv) : What is the standard of  proof required for making such 
declaration?  
25. The declaration that a person is not sagacious, righteous, non -
profligate, honest and ameen is such that create s a serious stigma on the  
reputation of that person. The standard of proof in making such 
declaration should , therefore , not be a mere preponderance of probability 
applied generally in civil cases. Rather, the higher standard of ‘clear and 
convincing proof’ should be applied for making such declaration. In this 
regard, we endorse  the principle enunciated  in Siddique Baloch27 and 
Sumaira Malik28 that the finding on the  fact of disqualification of a 
person under Article 62(1)(f) must be based on affirmative evidence , not 
on presumptions and sur mises. These cases, it may be mentioned, 
borrowed the pr inciple enunciated in Muhammad Yusuf29 regarding all 
                                                             
26 That is, the right to contest the election for the office of member of Parliament, which is enshrine d in the

disqualification s in general by holding that ‘ the law of election requires 
strict proof of the disqualification of a candidate as a corrupt practice 
and a finding with regard to disqualification must be based on positive 
evidence and not inferen tially on mere surmises ’.  
Article 62(1)(f) is not a self -executory provision  
26. As we have seen , Article 62(1)(f) by itself do es not identify  the court 
of law that has the jurisdiction  to make , and the persons who have the 
right to seek , the declaration mentioned in the said Article nor does it 
provide for the manner and procedure of making such declaration . That 
being so, a court  tasked to interpret the provisions of Article 62(1)(f) may 
argua bly have t wo options:  
(i) to progressively and liberally interpret the phrase , “there 
being no declaration to the contrary by a court of law ”, used 
in Article 62(1)(f) and hold that this phrase has impliedly  
conferred the jurisdiction on all courts of law to make, and 
the right of action on all persons to seek , the declaration that 
a person is not sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest 
and ameen ;   
or  
(ii) to restrictively and narrowly interpret this phrase and 
hold that it only means what it has expressly said, nothing 
more nothing less , and that it is for the legislature to make it 
operative by conferring the jurisdiction on a specific court of 
law to make, and the right of action on specified persons  to 
seek, such declaration .   
The first option obviously has the nuance of confer ring by a farfetched 
interpretation or judicial order the jurisdiction  on court s of law to make  
and the right  of action  to seek, the declaration  mentioned in Article 
62(1)(f) , as has been done by different Benches of this Court  in the afore -
discus sed cases. This  option also challenges the unchallenged legal 
position that only the legislature by enacting a law can confer any 
jurisdiction on a court of law and a right of action on a person that do es 
not exist in common law. Besides, while adopting such interpretation, a 
court also has to specify the acts of a person that may entail such 
declaration and provide the procedure for making such declaration. All 
these four acts of conf erring the jurisdiction, vesting the right  of action, 
specifying the acts  and providing the procedure would clearly amount to 
legislating rather than interpreting  law.  20 
 
27. Whereas the second option is consistent with the principle 
mentioned in the preface that the courts are to construe the fundamental 
rights guaranteed in the Constitution progressively and liberally, but the 
provisions whether in  the Constitution or in any law that curtail or limit 
the fundamental rights are to be construed restrictively and narrowly. 
The declaration by a court of law  mentioned in Article 62(1 )(f) has the 
consequence of curtailing the fundamental right of a person to contest 
the election for  the o ffice of a member of Parliament;30 therefore, the said 
principle requires that the provisions that mention such declaration 
should be construed restrictively and narrowly , and not  in a progressive 
and liberal manner to include or read into that which is not expressly 
provided therein. Such reading into the Constitution is also against the 
principle of harmonious interpretation of the provisions of the 
Constitution as it abridges the fundamental ri ght of citizens to co ntest 
the elections and vote for a candidate of their choice enshrined in Article 
17(2) of the Constitution, in the absence of reasonable restrictions 
imposed by law.  
28. Besides, b eing awar e of the fact that the phrase  “there being no 
declaration to the contrary by a court of law ” was added in Article 62(1)(f) 
by the 18th Amendment in the year 2010 , we cannot hold that this  
addition has made no change  in the meaning and scope of Article 62(1)(f) 
as being previously  understood and applied . Ignoring the  purpose of the 
change would be tantamount  to ignoring the intent of the legislature, 
which defies the very object of the judicial act of interpreting a provision 
of law, i.e., to ascertain the legislature ’s intent . Nor can redundancy  be 
attributed to the framers of the Constitution in making this addition  in 
Article 62(1)(f).  Before this addition, t here were several instances31 in 
which without determining the disputed fact s through a fair trial and 
due process, the provisions of Article 62(1)(f) were applied, or sought to 
be applied, for holding a person to be not sagacious, righteous, non -
profligate, honest and ameen. It was this arbitrary and whimsical  
application  of Article 62(1)(f) , or the posisisbility of its application in s uch 
manner, that was intended to be remedied by the legislature through  the 
                                                             
30 Javed Jabbar v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2003 SC 955; P.M.L. (Q) v. Chief Executive of Islamic Rep ublic

2008 Lah 130.  21 
 
addition of that phrase. The legislature’s intent was to restrict, not to 
liberalise, the applicability of Article 62(1)(f).  
29. In making this addition, the l egislature ’s intent  is more than clear 
in that every person must  be presumed  sagacious, righteous, non -
profligate, honest and ameen  unless a court of law has made a 
declaration against him to the contrary.  Holding that the special forums 
under the elections law or the constitu tional courts can declare a person 
disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) in the same way as they were  doing  
before the addition of that phrase would be a sheer negation of the 
legislature’ s intent . By adding that phrase , the legislature made it clear 
that Article 62(1) (f) is not self -executory and therefore cannot be applied 
by the special forums under the elections law or by the constitutional 
courts to disqualify a person from contesting the election for , or holding,  
the office of a member of Parliament , unless a court of law has made a 
declaration that he is not sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest 
and ameen . Therefore , Article 62(1)(f)  of the Constitution , in our 
considered opinion, is not  a self -executory  provision.  
Self-executory or non -self-executory provisions of the Constitution  
30. We may, however, underline here that our Constitution, like most 
of the modern constitutions, contains extensive provisions on certain 
matters that operate directly upon the rights and obligations of people 
and also delineates mostly the functions of different constitutional bodies 
and offices in sufficient details to make them operat ive per se .32 
Therefore, it may  be presumed that all provisions of the Constitution are 
self-executory unless there is an express p rovision or a necessary 
implication that requires or envisages a legislative act to enforce the 
constitutional mandate.  As a constitutional provision is self -executory if 
it does not require legislation to put it into effect,33 the question of 
whether a con stitutional provision is self-executory is largely determined 
by whether legislation  is a necessary prerequisite to the operation of the 
                                                             
32 See Justice Qazi Faez Isa v. President of Pakistan PLD 2023 SC 661 per Maqbool Baqar, J., et al.   wherein it 
was observed that  right conferred by Article  19A is effective in operation (self -executory) without enactment of a 
law; Sharaf Faridi v. Federation of Pakistan  PLD 1989 Kar 404 (7MB ), wherein it was held that Article 203 of 
the Constitution is effective in operation (self -executory) – This judgment was upheld in Govt. of Sindh v. Sharaf 
Faridi PLD 1994 SC 105 with some modifications; and Hakim Khan v. Govt. of Pakistan PLD 1992 SC 59 5, 
wherein it was held that Article 2A of the Constitution is not self -executory.  
33 Hakim Khan v. Govt. of Pakistan PLD 1992 SC 595  per Shafiur Rahman, J. , cited Bindra's Interpretation of 
Statutes, 7th  ed. , which describes that a constitutional provision  is self -executing if it supplies a sufficient rule 
by means of which the right which it grants may be enjoyed and protected, or the duty which it impos es may be 
enforced without the aid of a legislative enactment.    22 
 
provision.34 And the insurmountable difficulties in giving effect to a 
constitutional provision without legislation afford the strongest reason 
for concluding that the provision is not self -executory.35 
31. How then can the disqualification envisaged by Article 62(1)(f) be 
made executory is the question that also begs the answer. The answer is 
quite simple and straightfo rward : through the  legislative action, i.e., the 
enactment of a law.  Just as the declaration and the convictions 
mentioned in Article 63(1)(a), (g) and (h) are to be made by the courts of 
law that have been conferred jurisdiction, and in accordance with the 
procedure pr ovided , by or under the laws enacted by the legislature , the 
declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) is also to be made by a court of 
law that is conferred jurisdiction, and in accord ance with the procedure 
provid ed, by or under the law e nacted by the legislature.  There is, at 
present, no such law. Until such law is enacted to make its provision s 
executory, Article 62(1)(f)  stands on a similar footing as Article 62(1)(d), 
(e) and (g), and only serves as a guideline for the voters in exerci sing their 
right to vote.  
Failure of Sami Ullah Baloch  to adhere  to the principle of harmonious 
interpretation  
32. One of the most celebrated principles of constitutional 
interpretation is that a Constitution is to be read as an organic whole 
and its provisions, especiall y those closely related to each other , are to be 
harmoniously reconciled instead of making out inconsistencies between 
them. One constitutional provision cannot, unless expressly so provided, 
override the other nor can one be so constr ued as to destroy the other 
but rather both are to be construed harmoniously, each sustaining the 
other.36 The meaning and scope of an obscure provision is to be 
ascertained in light of that provision which manifests the intent of the 
constitution makers in  unequivocal terms. Because  the different parts of 
a Constitution are linked into a whole, i.e., the Constitution, and are not 
merely an unconnected bunch of isolated provisions; every provision is

related to a systemic plan and contributes to the function ing of an 
integrated scheme.37  
33. While interpreting Article 62(1)(f), Sami Ullah Baloch  did not notice 
the provisions of Article 175(2) , Article 4  and Article 10A ; did not give due 
effect to the provisions of Article 17(2) ; and did not read the provisions 
thereof  in harmony with the closely related Article 63(1) (h) of the 
Constitution  as it failed inter alia  to appreciate : 
(i) that as per Article 175(2), the jurisdiction to make the 
declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) can only be 
conferred on a  court of law by the Constitution or by or 
under any l aw; 
 
(ii) that as per Article 4, no action detrimental to the reputation 
of a person, such as making the declaration mentioned in 
Article 62(1)(f), can be taken except in accordance with law, 
which requires that there must be a law specifying those 
acts of a person that may entail the making of the 
declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f);  
 
(iii) that as per Article 10A , the person in respect of whom such 
declaration is to be made has a  right to a fair trial and due 
process, which requires that the manner and procedure for 
seeking and defending such declaration must be specified by 
law; 
 
(iv) that as per Article 17(2), the right to contest the election  for 
the office of a member of Parliament  can only be curtailed by 
restrictions imposed by law and that those restrictions  must 
also be reasonable ; and  
 
(v) that as per Article 63(1)(h), the act s of a person that may 
also justify the making of a declaration as mentioned in 
Article 62(1)(f) entail disqualification  only for a period of five 
years, recognizing the possibility of reformation in the 
character of persons  whereas the imposition of lifetime 
disqualification even takes away the incentive to reform one’ s 
character.  
In so doing, Sami Ullah  Baloch  sidestepped  the above -mentioned  
cherished principle of harmonious  interpretation . The most perplexing 
aspect of Sami Ullah Baloch  is that although it stated that ‘since the two 
provisions [Article 62(1)(f) and Article 63(1)(h)] pertain to the same 
subject matter, therefore, they ought to be construed harmoniously’,38 it 
failed to adhere to this principle. It overlooked the fact that as per Article

PLD 2011 SC 407 per Jawad S. Khawaja, J.  
38 Sami Ullah Baloch, para 28.  24 
 
63(1)(h), a conviction and less than a two-year sentence for an offence 
involving moral turpitude does n ot entail a disqualification, even for a 
single day. Therefore, while interpreting Article 62(1)(f), an implied 
intention that directly conflicts with the express constitutional mandate 
cannot be attributed to the constitution -makers, by holding that they 
intended for a civil declaration for the same conduct to have a lifelong 
disqualifying effect.  
Failure of Sami Ullah Baloch  to adhere  to the principle of interpreting 
laws in accordance with Islamic injunctions  
34. The second, but no less  important , principle of interpreting laws , 
as established not only by several judgments of this Court39 but also 
having been incorporated in an Act of Parliament40, is that while 
interpreting laws  if more than one interpretation s are possible, the courts 
should adopt that which is more consistent with the Islamic injunctions . 
On noticing certain directives enshrined in several provisions of the 
Constitution, including Article 227(1) which mandates th at all existing 
laws shall be brought in conformity with the Injunctio ns of Islam as laid 
down in the  Holy Quran and Sunnah and no law shall be enacted which 
is repugnant to such injunctions , this Court observed in Hamida 
Begum41: 
While the responsibility for bringing the existing laws in conformity with 
the Injunctions of Islam, and ensuring that no law shall b e enacted 
which is repugnant to such Injunctions, must rest with the executive and 
the legislative organs of the State, res ponsibility also devolves on the 
Judiciary to implement the spirit underlying these provisions of the 
Constitution. If, therefore, in any given situation, two interpretations are 
possible, one of which is conducive to the application of the laws of 
Islam, then the Courts ought to lean in favour of its adoption.  
In interpreting Article 62(1) (f), Sami Ullah Baloch  circumvented this 
principle also.  It though mentioned the Islamic concept of repentance 
and reformation (tawba  and islah) as argued by some of the learned 
counsel but did not address the same and determine its scope and 
applicability to the duration of the disqualification  incurred by the 
decla ration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f). It failed to appreciate  that 
lifetime disqualification amounts to condemnation in perpetuity and 
shuts the door to repentance and reformation ( tawba  and islah), which is

not consistent with the Islamic injunctions as laid down in the Holy 
Quran.42 In this regard, Sami Ullah Baloch also overlooked a six -member 
Bench judg ment that had given effect to the Islamic concept of 
repentance in Iftikhar Bar43 thus:  
15. However, on account of his confessing repentance shown  through the 
resignation tendered by him and also on account of the fact that we are 
not called upon, in these proceedings, to punish him for his above -
noticed acts, we have decided to exercise restraint in the said connection.  
A later case of Faisal Vawda44 also toed the line of Iftikhar Bar.  
Sami Ullah Baloch  is overruled  
35. There is no provision in the Constitution that obligates this Court 
to follow the law declared or the principle of law enunciated in its 
previous decision but rather it is the doctrin e of stare decisis  based on 
the rule of convenience, expediency and public policy which requires this 
Court to adhere to its previous decisions. We fully recognize  the 
importance  of this doctrine  which  helps  maintain  certainty  and 
consistency , one of the essential elements of the rule of law, and believe 
that unless there are compelling reasons to depart, it must be adhered 
to. Though it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of the reasons  that 
may justify such departure, one reason  may be stated conf idently,  i.e., 
when the previous decision is found to be ‘plainly and palpably wrong’, 
the doctrine of stare decisis does not prevent a court from overruling it.45 
This reason  is also named as ‘a clear manifestation of error’.46  
36. While overruling Dosso47 in Asma Jilani48, after referring to certain 
authorities on the point that in the matter of constitutional 
interpretation , the doctrine  of stare decisis  has limited application, 
Hamoodur  Rehman, CJ. speaking for the Court, observed:   
Whatever be the scope of stare decisis and its limited application to the 
interpretation of constitutional instruments, Kelsen's theory on which 
Munir, C. J., relied was neither a norm of the National Legal Order, nor a 
statutory provision. Its application  in upholding the "victorious 
revolution" by Iskander Mirza did not, therefore, attract the doctrine of 
stare decisis.  
                                                             
42 Qu’ranic verses on the subject include: surah 2, al -Baqarah, verse 160;  surah 4, al -Nisa, verse 146; surah 6, al -
An‘am, verse 54; surah 7, al -Aa‘raf, verse 153; and surah 25, al -Furqan, verse 70..

48 Asma Jilani v. Govt. of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139.  26 
 
The principle deducible from the above ob servation of the learned Chief 
Justice is that where the decision of a court is not based upon some 
constitutional or statutory provision, the doctrine of stare decisis  does 
not apply to such decision.  
37. As observed above, neither the Constitution nor any law specifies 
the court of law that is competent to make the declaration mentioned in 
Articl e 62(1)(f) and provides for the manner and procedure of making 
such declaration. The decision given in Sami Ullah Baloch  that the 
declaration made by a court of civil jurisdiction regarding breach of 
certain civil rights and obligations is a declaration me ntioned in Article 
62(1)(f) and that such declaration has a lifelong disqualifying effect, is not 
based on any constitutional or statutory provision but rather amounts to 
legislating and reading into the Constitution and is therefore found to be 
‘plainly a nd palpably wrong’. Thus, with great  respect to the learned 
Judges who rendered the decision in Sami Ullah Baloch , we hold that the 
statement of law made therein is not correct and  is therefore overrule d. 
Validity  of Section 232(2) of the Elections Act 2017  
38. Section 232(2) added in the Elections Act  2017  vide the Elections 
(Amendment) Act 2023 has prescribed a period of five years for the 
disqualification incurred by any judgment, order or decree of any court 
in terms of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and has also made such 
declaration subject to the due process of law. Although whi le rely ing 
upon a case49 from the neighbouring jurisdiction it was argued before us 
that under  the doctrine of constitutional si lence or abeyance, the 
legislature can by a sub -constitutional law provide for the duration of the 
effect of the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f), we are of the 
opinion , in view of our finding that Article 62(1)(f) is not self -executory, 
there remains no need to examine the validity and scope of Section 
232(2) of the Elections Act.  
Facts of and decisions on the appeals and petitions  
39. Having found that Article 62(1)(f)  is not a self -executory  provision  
and is to be made operative through  enacting a law that specifies the 
court of law which is competent to make the declaration mentioned in 
                                                             
49 Bhanumati v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 2010 SC 3796.  27 
 
Article 62(1)(f) and provides for the manner and procedure of making  
such declarat ion, and that until such law is enacted, Article 62(1)(f) only 
serves as a guideline for the voters in exercising their right to vote, we 
proceed to examine the facts of the present appeals and petitions and 
decide them in accordance with  the said legal po sition.  
Civil Appeal No. 982/2018  
40. The respondent, Muhammad Islam,  was found to have  filed fake 
testimonial s of his education,  in the general elections held in 2013 ; 
therefore, the notification of the Election Commission declaring him the 
returned candidate for a seat of the Punjab Provincial Assembly was set 
aside by this Court vide its order dated 18.07.2013  passed on a CMA in 
Civil Appeals No.191 -L and 409 of 2010 . Later, in the general elections of 
2018, the nomination paper of the respondent was accepted by the 
Returning Officer. The appellant, Hamza Rasheed Khan, alleging 
disqualification of the resplendent under Article 62(1)(f), filed an appeal 
against  the order of the Returning Officer, which was dismissed by the 
Appellate Tribunal with the observation that since there had been no 
declaration against the respondent by a court of law that he was not 
sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen, the objec tion 
was not sustainable.  The appellant challenged  the order of the Appellate 
Tribunal before the Lahore High Court in its writ jurisdiction. The High 
Court dismissed the writ petition  of the appellant , by not only endorsing 
the said observation of the App ellate Tribunal but also further observing 
that in the absence of a positive declaration as contemplated by Article 
62(1)(f), it could not be inferred that the respondent was not sagacious, 
righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen. Hence, this appeal.  We find 
that the observations of the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court are 
perfectly correct  and warrant no interference by this Court . This appeal 
is meritless and is , therefore, dismissed. We may clarify here that in  the 
short order , the appeal  was mistakenly mentioned as involving  
disqualification  of the appellant , instead of the respondent, which error 
stand s corrected  as per this clarification .       
Civil Appeal No. 984/2018  
41. The respondent, Fazal Mehmood,  was found to have filed a fake 
certificate of  his educational qualification as  B.A., in the general elections  28 
 
held in 20 08; therefore, his nomination paper was rejected by the 
Appellate Tribunal . Later, in the general elections of 2018, the 
nomination paper of the respondent was accept ed by the Returning 
Officer. The appellant, Mumtaz Ahmad, filed an appeal against the order 
of the Returning Officer, which was allowed by the Appellate Tribunal , 
and the Returning Officer was directed to exclude the name of the 
respondent from the list of  the contesting candidates, on the ground that 
he did not fulfil the disqualification  contained in  Article 62(1)(f) . The 
respondent challenged the order of the Appellate Tribunal before the 
Lahore High Court in its writ jurisdiction. The High Court accepte d the 
writ petition  of the respondent and directed the Returning Officer to 
include his name in the list of the contesting candidates, with the 
observation  that in the absence of a positive declaration as contemplated 
by Article 62(1)(f), it could not be i nferred that the respondent was not 
sagacious, righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen. Hence,  this 
appeal.  We find that the observation of the High Court  and the impugned 
judgment based thereon are perfectly correct and warrant no interference 
by this  Court. This appeal is meritless and is, therefore, dismissed.  
Civil Appeal No. 880/2015  
42. The appellant, Ch. Muhammad Arif Hussain, a returned  candidate 
for a seat of the National Assembly in the general  elections of 2013, was 
found to have  filed fake testimonials of his education , in the election 
petition filed by the respondent, Fayyaz Ahmad Khan Ghouri ; therefore, 
the Election Tribunal declared his election as a returned candidate void, 
holding him disqualified under Article 62(1)(f). Hence, this app eal. In 
pursuance of the judgment  of the Election Tribunal , the bye -election for 
the seat vacated by the appellant was held and  the term of the said 
Assembly  has also since long expired . The appeal  as such ha s become 
infructuous  and is, therefore, disposed of with the clarification that the 
impugned judgment of the Election Tribunal is not a declaration as 
mentioned in Article 62(1)(f ). 
Civil Appeal No. 1946/2023  
43. The appellant, Muhammad Khan Junejo , was found to have filed 
fake testimonials of his education, in the general elections of 2002 ; 29 
 
therefore, his election as a returned candidate for a seat of the National 
Assembly was declared void.  In the later elections of 2013, he  was again 
declared  disqualified to contest the electi ons because of his foul play 
detected in the previous election , holding that he was  not sagacious, 
righteous, non -profligate, honest and ameen as required to be under 
Article 62(1)(f).  His nomination paper for the bye -election for a seat of the 
National Assembly to be held in 2023 was also rejected on the same 
ground. In 2023, the appellant  while relying upon Allah Dino Bhayo ,  
filed a writ petition in the High Court of Sindh seeking a preemptive relief 
of declaration of h is eligibility to contest the upcoming general elections 
of 2024, on the ground  that any determination of his disqualification  
made under Article 62(1 )(f) before the addition of the phrase “there being 
no declaration to the contrary by a court of law” in t hat article through 
the 18th amendment did not disqualify him for future elections. The High 
Court disposed of the petition, with the observation that the appellant 
may plead that ground at the appropriate stage before the relevant forum 
in the forthcoming  elections. Hence, this appeal. We find that the 
observation of the High Court was correct in the legal position then 
prevailing. But as we have reconsidered  the interpretation of Article 
62(1)(f) and made certain  declarations as to its meaning, scope and 
applicability , this appeal is disposed of in terms of those declarations . 
C.P.L.A No. 2680/2023  
44. The petitioner, Kashif Mehmood, was found to have wrongly 
mentioned his educational qualification as B.B.A. in his nomination 
paper filed in the general elections held in 2018  and in this regard , to 
have also filed a false affidavit ; therefore, he was de-seated by the 
Islamabad High Court from a  seat of the Punjab Provincial Assembly for 
which he had been elected. For the forthcoming elections of 2024, his  
nomination paper was rejected by the Returning Officer holding him 
disqualified under Article 62(1) (f) but  on his appeal, the same  was 
accepted by the Appellate Tribunal with the observation that the 
determination made by the Islamabad High Court was not a declaration 
as mentioned in Article 62(1 )(f). On the writ petition filed by the 
respondent, Mehmood Ahmed, the High Court reversed the decision of 
the Appellate Tribunal and restored that of the Returning Officer. Hence, 30 
 
this appeal. We find that the obs ervation of the Appellate Tribunal and 
the order based thereon were  legally correct, and should not have been 
interfered with by the High Court. The impugned  judgment of the High 
Court, even otherwise, is not sustainable in view of the declaration s 
made above as to the meaning, scope and applic ability of Article 62(1)(f). 
This petition is , therefore , converted into an appeal and the same is 
allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. Consequently, the 
nomination paper of the petitioner stands accep ted.  
45. Civil Appeals No. 981 and 985 of 2018 have different facts,  
involv ing conviction for certain offences; while C.M. Appeal No. 135 of 
2022 and Constitution Petition No. 40 of 2022 invoke different 
jurisdictions , involving  different  implications. Th ese cases are , therefore,  
de-listed, which shall be posted for hearing separately before appropriate 
Benches.  
46. These are the reasons for our short order dated 8 January 2023, 
which has been reproduced in the leading judgment authored by Hon’ble 
the Chief Justice.
