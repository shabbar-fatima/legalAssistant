ORDER  
 
 
The learne d Prosecutor -General  Accountability has informed 
that separate References have already been filed before the 
Registrar of the Accountability Court, Rawalpindi/Islamabad in the 
matter s pertaining to Mr. Ahmed Riaz Sheikh and M r. Adnan A . 
Khawaja . He has also informed that in the matter of Malik 
Muhammad Qayyum the circumstances of the case showed that 
only an offence under section 9(a)(vi) of the National Accountability 
Ordinance, 1999 could be said to have been attracted but i n his Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 486 of 2010  
in Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2002, etc.  3 
opinion no such case is made out which opinion, after a detailed 
discussion, was agreed with by the Executive Board Meeting held 
on 17.09.2012.  
 
2. We note that in this Court’s judgme nt handed down in the 
case of Dr. Mubashir Hassan  this Court had expressly  concluded 
that the letters written by Malik Muhammad Qayyum to the Swiss 
and other authorities were “unauthorized and illegal” and, thus, we 
have been  intrigued  by the fact that the National Accountability  
Bureau has  decided to take no action again st him for such 
unauthorized and illegal action. In this view of the matter  the 
learned Prosecutor -General  Accountability is directed to produce 
before the next date of hearing  a copy of his opinion  as well as a 
copy of the decision taken by the Executive Board Meeting on 
17.09.2012  in the matter of Malik Muhammad Qayyum. In the 
matters pertaining to Mr. Ahmed Riaz Sheikh and Mr. Adnan A. 
Khawaja we note that the beneficiaries  of the illegal 
appointment/promotion as well as the persons directing such 
illega l appointment/promotion have prima facie been screened and 
no Reference has  been filed against them whereas References have 
been filed only against those who had implemented the directions 
so issued. We would like to know the reasons which prevailed with 
the National Accountability  Bureau for no t filing any Reference 
against the beneficiaries  and the persons directing the illegal 
appointment/promotion and for singling out merely those who had 
acted upon the said directions . Let, th erefore, the learned 
Prose cutor -General Accountability submit separate reports in the 
matters of Mr. Ahmed Riaz Sheikh and Mr. Adnan A. Khawaja  Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 486 of 2010  
in Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2002, etc.  4 
pointing out the reasons, factual or legal, prevailing with the 
National Accountability Bureau for not filing any Reference against 
the beneficiaries  and those who had directed the illegal 
appointment/promotion. The requisite report s should be filed with 
the office of this Court before the next date of hearing and copies of 
the same may be supplied to the learned counsel  representing the 
concerned persons.  
 
3. Mr. Shaiq Usmani, Sr. ASC has been representing the 
Chairman, National Accountability Bureau in the present 
proceedings and he has stated that his job has been accomplished 
and he has no further assistance to render in this regard and,  
therefore, he may be relieved of his duties of representing the 
Chairman, National Accountability Bureau henceforth. We note 
that the National Accountability Bureau is already being 
represented in the present proceedings through various officials of 
the s aid Bureau including the learned Prosecutor -General  
Accountability and his team. In these circumstances the request 
made by Mr. Shaiq Usmani, Sr. ASC is acceded to and he is 
relieved of his duties as counsel for the Chairman, National 
Accountability Bureau .
