ORDER  
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha 
A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi , Shahid Waheed and 
Irfan Saadat Khan,  JJ.: For detailed reasons to be recorded later and 
subject to what is set out therein by way of amplification and/or 
explanation or otherwise, these appeals are decided in the follo wing terms:  
1. The impugned judgment dated 25.03.2024 of the learned Full Bench 
of the High Court is set aside to the extent it is or may be inconsistent with 
this Order or the detailed reasons.  
2. The order of the Election Commission of Pakistan (“Commission”) 
dated 01.03.2024 (“Impugned Order”) is declared to be ultra vires the 
Constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  
3. The notifications (of various dates) whereby the persons respectively 
mentioned therein (being the persons identified in th e Commission’s 
notification No.F.5(1)/2024 -Cord. dated 13.05.2024) have been declared to 
be returned candidates for reserved seats for women and minorities in the 
National and Provincial Assemblies are declared to be ultra vires the 
Constitution, without l awful authority and of no legal effect, and are 
quashed from 06.05.2024 onwards, being the date an interim order was 
made by the Court in CPLA Nos. 1328 -9 of 2024, the leave petitions out of 
which the instant appeals arise.  
4. It is declared that the lack or denial of an election symbol does not in 
any manner affect the constitutional and legal rights of a political party to 
participate in an election (whether general or bye) and to field candidates 
and the Commission is under a constitutional duty to act, and  construe 
and apply all statutory provisions, accordingly.    Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.  
 
 5
5. It is declared that for the purposes, and within the meaning, of 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of clause (6) of Article 51 (“Article 51 Provisions”) and 
paragraph (c) of clause (3) of Article 106 (“Art icle 106 Provisions”) of the 
Constitution, the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (“PTI”) was and is a political 
party, which secured or won (the two terms being interchangeable) general 
seats in the National and Provincial Assemblies in the General Elections of 
2024 as herein after provided.  
6. During the course of the hearing of the instant appeals, on 
27.06.2024, learned counsel for the Commission placed before the Court a 
list (“the List”) of 80 returned candidates for the National Assembly (now 
MNAs), setting out i n tabular form particulars relating to their election. 
Learned counsel made a categorical statement that the Commission stood 
by the data so provided to the Court. In particular, the List contained three 
columns marked as follows: (i) “Statement (on nomina tion form) given in 
declaration and oath by the person nominated (i.e.,  ‘I belong to’)”; (ii) 
“Certificate of party affiliation under Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017”; 
and (iii) “Statutory Declaration/affidavit accompanying section 66 
certificate”.  
7. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the General Election of 
2024, it is declared that out of the aforesaid 80 returned candidates (now 
MNAs) those (being 39 in all and whose particulars are set out in Annex A 
to this Order) in respect of whom the C ommission has shown “PTI” in any 
one of the aforesaid columns in the List, were and are the returned 
candidates whose seats were and have been secured by the PTI within the 
meaning, and for purposes of, para 5 above in relation to the Article 51 
Provisions . 
8. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the General Election of 
2024, it is further ordered that any of the remaining 41 returned 
candidates out of the aforesaid 80 (whose particulars are set out in Annex 
B to this Order) may, within 15 working days o f this Order file a statement 
duly signed and notarized stating that he or she contested the General 
Election as a candidate of the political party specified therein. If any such 
statement(s) is/are filed, the Commission shall forthwith but in any case 
within 7 days thereafter give notice to the political party concerned to file, Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.  
 
 6
within 15 working days, a confirmation that the candidate contested the 
General Election as its candidate. A political party may in any case, at any 
time after the filing of a stat ement as aforesaid, of its own motion file its 
confirmation. If such a statement is filed, and is confirmed by the political 
party concerned, then the seat secured by such candidate shall be 
forthwith deemed to be a seat secured by that political party for  the 
purposes of para 5 above in relation to the Article 51 Provisions. The 
Commission shall also forthwith issue, and post on its website, a list of the 
retuned candidates (now MNAs) and seats to which this para applies within 
7 days after the last date o n which a political party may file its confirmation 
and shall simultaneously file a compliance report in the Court.  
9. For the purposes of para 5 of this Order in relation to the Article 51 
Provisions, the number of general seats secured by PTI shall be the t otal of 
the seats declared in terms of para 7 and those, if any, to which para 8 
applies. The PTI shall be entitled to reserved seats for women and 
minorities in the National Assembly accordingly. PTI shall, within 15 
working days of this Order file its li sts of candidates for the said reserved 
seats and the provisions of the Elections Act, 2017 (“Act”) (including in 
particular s. 104) and the Elections Rules, 2017 (“Rules”) shall be applied 
to such lists in such manner as gives effect to this Order in full  measure. 
The Commission shall, out of the reserved seats for women and minorities 
in the National Assembly to which para 3 of this Order applies, notify as 
elected in terms of the Article 51 Provisions, that number of candidates 
from the lists filed (or, as the case may be, to be filed) by the PTI as is 
proportionate to the general seats secured by it in terms of paras 7 and 8 of 
this Order.  
10. The foregoing paras shall apply mutatis mutandis for purposes of the 
Article 106 Provisions in relation to PTI (as s et out in para 5 herein above) 
for the reserved seats for women and minorities in the Khyber Pakhtunkwa, 
Punjab and Sindh Provincial Assemblies to which para 3 of this Order 
applies. In case the Commission or PTI need any clarification or order so as 
to give effect to this para in full measure, it shall forthwith apply to the 
Court by making an appropriate application, which shall be put up before Civil Appeal No. 333 of 2024 etc.
