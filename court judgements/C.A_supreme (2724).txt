2.  It is observed that the amendments made on 
22.04 .2022 in the Exit From Pakistan (Control) Rules, 2010 
(“Rules” ) have been enforce d retrospectively. This appears to 
have been done without the necessary authorizat ion for  giving  
such an effect to the amendment s in the Rules. It is also not 
clear whether the Rules have been approved by the Federal  
Cabinet and , if so, whether beneficiar ies of the amendment s 
recused  themselves from attending the relevant meeting. In 
this regard i t has to be shown whether avoidance  of conflict of 
interest was duly catered for; data regarding the names of the  
beneficiaries  of such relief  who have left Pakistan  also needs 
to be provided . The foregoing information shall be supplied by 
the learned A ttorney General . 
3.  The names of 174 persons who are accused in 
NAB cases have been removed from the E xit Control Lis t 
(“ECL”). This was done , prima facie,  without consult ing the 
NAB authorities and as a result of retrospective 
implementation of the amendmen ts. Learned A ttorney 
General  shall apprise about the grounds that prevailed for 
dispensing with consultation before passing the orders . On 
their part the  NAB authoriti es shall specify the na ture of 
offences under the NAB Ordinance alleged agains t those 
accused per sons whose n ames have been removed from the 
ECL. SMC 2 OF 2022
