IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN  
(Original Jurisdiction)  
  
                 PRESENT : 
MR. JUSTICE IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ  
MR. JUSTICE GULZAR AHMED  
MR. JUSTICE SH. AZMAT SAEED  
                    
(IN THE MATTER OF DEATH/MURDER/ SUICIDE   OF MR. 
KAMRAN FAISAL, (DECEASED)  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR/IO OF 
NAB IN RENTAL POWER PLANTS CASE)  
  
  
Voluntarily appeared:     Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, MNA  
                    Kh. Muhammad Asif, MNA  
  
For the NAB:                   Mr. K.K. Agha, PG, NAB  
  
                 
Date of hearing:  23.01.2013  
ORDER  
  
        Office has submitted a detailed Report based on material inter alia 
stating therein that Kamran Faisal, (deceased) Assistant Director, NAB 
 engaged in the investigation of the High Profile Case of Rental P ower 
Projects   (RPPs Case) was found mysteriously dead in his room at the Federal 
Lodges, Islamabad on Friday i.e. 18.1.2013. This shocking incident of his murder/death/suicide is a sad commentary on the image of a public 
institution, which is supposed to be functioning in a free, fair and 
independent  manner, without being influenced or coursed by anyone. Prima 
facie,  it seems that besides the colleagues of Kamran Faisal (deceased), his 
family members as well as the public at large have shown annoyance and 
raised grievance. According to their versions, they are not expecting a free, 
fair and honest investigation because of the involvement of the highly 
influential, political persons and executive authorities of this country in the 
scam of RPPs.  
2.             We may also point out that it is a fundamental right of all citizens 
that their lives and properties must be protected by a State, particularly, of 
those persons, who honestly and with full dedications, are discharging their 
functions in order to invest igate the allegations against the accused persons, 
involved in the cases of corruption and the corrupt practices, who are, prima 
facie , responsible for looting and plundering the wealth of this country, and if 
there is any failure or disappointment and the  facts come into the notice of 
this Court, it also becomes its duty to look into the matter and   independently 
ensure that the justice is done.  3.             Therefore, we treat this note, sent by the Reg istrar (Office) of this 
Court,  as a Constitution P etition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. As, this Bench is seized with the 
issue relating to the implementation of the judgment of this Court dated 30th 
March, 2012, therefore, Office is directed to place this case before Bench 
No.II headed by Mr. Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja on 24th January, 2013 for 
further proceedings.  
  
                                                            Chief Justice        
  
                                                                Judge  
  
                                                                Judge  
  
Islamabad, the                                          
23rd  January, 2013.
