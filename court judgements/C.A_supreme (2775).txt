  Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. — The case at hand 
involves issues of corruption a nd white collar crime. The case was 
brought to our notice by Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) . 
TIP highlighted  violation s of Public Procurement Rules , 2004 (PPRA 
Rules ) in procurement of properties  in its letter dated 06.05.2010.  
These violations have allegedly caused losses worth  billions of rupees  
in the span of only six months  after appointment of Ayyaz Khan Niazi SMC 18/2010 etc.  3 
as Chairman on 12.12.2009 of the National Insurance Company Ltd. 
(NICL), which is a  public enterprise.    
2.  It is to be noted that N ICL was  initially  established under 
the National Insurance Act, 1976 , but  later it was registered as a 
Public Limited Company through National Insurance Company 
(Reorganization) Ordinance , 2000 . The m ajor Objectives of NICL are 
as follows: - 
(a) To provide insu rance cover to the Government/Semi 
Government organizations at economical cost.  
(b) To reduce outflow of foreign exchange by reducing dependence 
on reinsurance abroad.  
(c) To make significant contributions to public exchequer by 
payment of taxes & dividends.  
(d) To ma ke prudent investments in public as well as private sector 
in order to obtain maximum returns.  
 
TIP alleged  violation s of the PPRA Rules  in respect of following 
transactions: - 
“(1) Procurement of 803 kanal – 19 Marla Plot in Lahore reportedly 
belonging to Ex-MNA Mr. Habibullah Warraich, which had market 
value of Rs.300,000/ - per Kanal, whereas NICL was buying it at 
Rs.2,000,000/ - per Kanal.  
(2)  27000 sft. Office space in Dubai in Liberty tower was purchased 
in July 2009 @ UAE Dirham 2,700 per sft., against  the market 
price of AED 1,200 per sq. ft. allegedly  causing loss to 
exchequer of Rs.900 million.  
 
(3)  10 Acre plot purchased in Korangi Deh Phihai, in August 2009 @ 
Rs.90,000,000/ - per acre, against maximum market price of 
Rs.20,000,000/ - per acre, caus ing loss Rs.70,000,000/ - per 
acre.  
 
(4)  Award of Contracts of painting works and furniture to M/s Casa 
Bella Lahore, Karachi  for Rs.26.987 million and at Islamabad for 
Rs.9.31 million, who was not a license holder of Pakistan 
engineering Council. The ten der for Karachi was for 6 floors but 
the Contractor has been asked to paint only 4 floors.  
 
(5)  Land was purchased in Lahore in the year 2009 from Mr. Mohsin 
Warraich for Rs.1.5 billion, whose market value was Rs.30 
million causing loss to Exchequer Rs.1. 2 billion. ” 
 SMC 18/2010 etc.  4 
3.  The letter of TIP dated 06.05.2010 was registered as 
Human Rights Case No.18567 -S/2010. In the meanwhile , another 
letter by one Asif Ahmed which was mostly based on the same 
allegations was received and numbered as HRC No.3379-S/2010. 
These applications were forwarded for discreet inquiry to National 
Accountability Bureau (NAB), established under National Accountability  
Ordinance, 1999  (NAO , 1999 ). Comments were separately submitted, 
which prima facie  revealed that the managemen t of NICL fa iled to 
observe the PPRA Rules in purchase of the land at Lahore and Karachi 
etc. Similarly, reports from the Chief Secretary and the Board of 
Revenue, Government of Punjab were solicited to ascertain  the 
accuracy  of the allegations brought to our notice.  
4.   Notices were issued to the Chairman NICL  vide order dated 
27.08.2010  and the case was fixed in the Court on 12.10.2010 and 
following order was passed: - 
 “4.  In response to notice, Mr. Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, learned 
senior ASC has appeared along  with Mr. Ayaz Khan Niazi, 
Chairman, NICL and stated that the deal of purchase of 803 
Kanals of the land has been cancelled. It is stated that in the 
meanwhile NAB has also conducted investigation and directed 
that amount which has been obtained by the seller i. e. Owner of 
M/s. Privilege Farms Limited, Lahore be frozen and confirmation 
whereof has also been obtained from the Accountability Court as 
stated by Mr. Muhammad Akbar Tarrar, Additional Prosecutor 
General, NAB.  
5.  We have heard the case at a considerab le length during 
the course whereof it transpired that in respect of the sale of 
803 kanals of the land situated at Mouza Toor Waraich, Off 
Ferozepur Road Tehsil Cantt Distt. Lahore, an amount of Rs.1.6 
billion was paid to the seller without first finalizi ng transfer of 
the property in the name of NICL by registered sale deed and 
mutation entries were also not made in its favour, therefore, SMC 18/2010 etc.  5 
prima -facie, we are of the opinion that this transaction itself is 
sufficient to conclude that the Chairman and other concerned 
persons are responsible for misappropriation of the money taken 
out from NICL account which ultimately belongs to Government 
exchequer and they have indulged into corruption and corrupt 
practices. However, as far as the remaining allegations note d 
hereinabove are concerned they are also required to be probed 
into by the Investigation Agency and the same, too, needs a 
probe by concerned functionaries under Public Procurement 
Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 read with the Public 
Procurement Rule s, 2004 as well as criminal law on the subject.  
6.  In view of above facts, the presence of Secretary, 
Ministry of Commerce and D.G., F.I.A. was procured. The former 
candidly admitted that illegalities have been committed in the 
transactions which are hig hlighted hereinabove. Therefore, 
without further commenting on merits lest it may not prejudice 
the case of any of the parties, the Secretary Commerce is 
directed that he would immediately lodge the criminal 
complaint/report with F.I.A. in respect of these  transactions 
against Ayaz Khan Niazi, Chairman, NICL and all other 
concerned persons. The Director General/Additional Director 
General, F.I.A. is also directed to register the case against all 
the concerned persons for misappropriation of public money and  
indulging in corruption and corrupt practices by following the 
law accordingly and send a copy thereof to the Registrar of this 
Court for placing the same on record. The Director General, 
F.I.A. shall keep the NAB informed of the progress being made 
in the investigation since it was on the orders of the N.A.B., the 
accounts of the seller etc. have been frozen with confirmation 
obtained from Accountability Court. The F.I.A. and the N.A.B. 
shall finally decide the matters relating to the trial of the 
accused  persons. ” 
5.  It is to be observed that NAB has submitted reports 
pursuant to the directions of this Court on 23.04.2010, 19.05.2010 
25.05.2010, 02.06.2010 and 21 .06.2010  passed in Chamber . In this 
context , directions  were issued  to DG FIA to keep NAB informed about 
the progress of the case . NAB ordered the accounts of the seller etc. to SMC 18/2010 etc.  6 
be frozen with confirmation obtained from the Accountability Court. 
During  the course of the investigation two FIRs number ed 24/2010 
and 29/2010 were registered at Lahore and one Habibullah Warraich 
was arrested . Mr. Zafar Ahmed  Qureshi , Additional DG FIA,  report ed 
that out of total liability of Rs.1,68 0 million in FIR No.24/2010 , an 
amount of Rs.1,280 million was recovered and the balance amount of 
Rs.280 million was likely to be recovered by 31.12.2010 as cheques 
have already been issued by Mohsin Habibullah Warraich. A s far as FIR 
No.29/2010 is concerned, Rs.710 million were recovered .  
6.  It so happened that despite the fact that Mr.  Qureshi  
effected the aforementioned recoveries , he was  transferred  from FIA . 
Upon this, the  Secretary Interior was asked to look into the matter on 
25.01.2011 when the following order was passed: - 
“Ch. Qamaruzzaman, Secretary, Ministry of Interior, 
Government of Pakistan has placed on record  the notification 
dated 24.01.2011, issued by the Government of Pakistan 
whereby Capt. (Retd.) Zafar Ahmed Qureshi, Managing Director, 
National Police Foundation has been appointed as Additional 
Director General, FIA in addition to his present assignment w ith 
immediate effect till further orders to supervise investigation of 
the NICL case at Lahore.  
2. It is to be noted that during the period when he was 
supervising the investigation and the investigation was likely to 
make effective progress, he was abrupt ly transferred on the 
pretext that after his promotion in Grade 21 he could not 
continue as a Director over there, but we feel that this device 
was adopted with a mala fide intention otherwise by an identical 
notification as has now been issued, the author ities could have 
allowed him to continue with the investigation of an important 
case, involving a huge public money, which has allegedly been 
looted.  
3. Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi is present. He has explained the 
progress made by him so far in the investigati on of the case. 
When inquired as to why he is not treating all the accused 
persons at par because one of the Directors of NICL, Amin 
Qasim Dada has not been arrested whereas remaining Directors 
have already been taken in custody of the FIA, he answered 
that despite his best efforts he was not allowed to do it. He 
stated that whenever any person is required from Lahore where 
he is posted as a Director, the needful is done, but when he had 
gone to Karachi and contacted Moazzam Jah, Director FIA over SMC 18/2010 etc.  7 
there in connection with the arrest of Amin Qasim Dada, 
Moazzam Jah told him that Amin Qasim Dada used to sit with 
DG, FIA in his camp office, therefore, how he could cause his 
arrest. On Court query, the Director FIA, Karachi, who is 
present, stated that 4 -5 days before the registration of the case 
and after the order had already been passed by this Court, Amin 
Qasim Dada was present with the DG, FIA. Be that as it may, 
DG, FIA is equally responsible for not causing his arrest. It 
seems that instead of allowing his  Director to make progress in 
the case, he is providing shelter to the accused persons; 
therefore, we direct the Additional Director General, FIA, Zafar 
Ahmed Qureshi to take all necessary steps for causing his arrest 
and if on a further probe he comes to the conclusion that the 
accused is being given shelter by the DG, FIA, then he should 
proceed against the DG too in accordance with law because no 
one is above the law. He further explained that all efforts shall 
be made to explore the possibility as to ho w the Government 
money was taken out of the accounts of the NICL, where the 
same was spent and in whose accounts the same was 
deposited. In this behalf, he has particularly made reference to 
the case of M/S Al -Tahoor Co., whose Manager Abdul Maalik has 
already been arrested and stated during interrogation that the 
account was opened in Allied Bank Ltd, Airport Road Branch, 
Lahore in the name of one Adil Manzoor whose name/NIC was 
used but when said Adil Manzoor was interrogated, he stated 
that he had no kno wledge of the same, but according to the 
statement of Manager Abdul Maalik, an amount of 22 crores of 
rupees has been given to Moonis Elahi. According to him, as 
progress was being made in the meanwhile, he was transferred 
and made under orders of DG (Wase em Ahmed) to relinquish 
the charge immediately. Be that as it may, Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi has now again been posted as Additional Director 
General, FIA, therefore, he would be supervising investigation of 
the case pertaining the persons concerned.  
4. Directo r Moazzam Jah also gave progress report, which does 
not seem satisfactory as no step has been taken by him as well 
to cause arrest of the accused persons, who had left the country 
inasmuch as Amin Qasim Dada, who was available in Karachi 
and according to h is information he was sitting with DG, FIA 
after passing of order by this Court, he ought to have taken 
necessary steps to cause his arrest. Similarly, he had taken no 
steps to recover the amount from the account of Ayaz Khan 
except making attachment of th e property but making no probe 
in the matter thoroughly fixing the responsibility upon the 
accused persons, which indicates that the investigation is not 
being carried out honestly, fairly and properly. However, we 
may give him another chance to proceed wi th the matter strictly 
in accordance with law and submit report on the next date of 
hearing in this behalf.  
5. The Secretary Commerce has stated that he has sent a letter 
to the Auditor General of Pakistan to conduct special audit of the 
NICL. ” 
   SMC 18/2010 etc.  8 
7.  In the meanwhile , Mr. Moazzam Jah Ansari, Director FIA  
Karachi,  submitted comprehensive report. The relevant para of the 
order dated 17.02.2011 highlighting the progress in the investigation 
in respect of FIRs No.13, 14 and 21 of 2010 registered at Karachi 
reads as under: - 
“2. The matter was registered as HRC. No.3379 -S/2010 and 
vide letter dated 12.02.2010, report was called from Chief 
Secretary Punjab, who submitted his report on 4.3.2010 stating 
therein that NICL intended to purchase a piece of land for 
developing a housing colony at Lahore at exorbitant price to 
benefit a few persons, who were behind the deal.  
 
3. Vide letter dated 24.3.2010 report was called from 
Secretary Board of Revenue, Punjab, who in his report dated 
2.4.2010 narrated the same answer as was given by the Chief 
Secretary, Punjab. Thereafter, vide order dated 26.4.2010 the 
matter was referred to Chairman NAB for conducting discreet 
inquiry and report. The Chairman NAB, submitted reports dated 
19.5.2010, 1.6.2010 and 14.6.2010. In the ligh t of the reports 
submitted by the authorities, the matter was then registered as 
SMC No.18/2010 and was fixed before the Court on 12.10.2010.  
4. On 12.10.2010, when the matter was taken up in Court 
as Suo Moto Case, the Secretary Commerce was directed to 
lodge criminal complaint/report with F.I.A., in respect of above 
transactions against all concerned, as a result whereof a case 
FIR No.24/2010 dated 12.10.2010 under sections 409, 420, 109 
PPC read with 5(2) PCA was registered with FIA Circle, Lahore. 
Howev er, this Court feeling dissatisfied with the above 
proceedings, directed the FIA to accelerate the proceedings; 
cause arrest of the accused, particularly the influential persons; 
and to register cases regarding other incidents. ” 
 
    
8.  As far as the case s pertaining to Karachi are concerned, 
Mr. Ansari  stated that an amount of Rs.100 million ha d been recovered 
and property worth Rs.500 million ha d been seized but the cash is to 
be managed after putting th e property on auction and hopefully after 
adjustmen t, the government money shall be recovered from the 
property which has already been attached.  
9.  In the meanwhile , Commerce Division had a  special audit 
of NICL  conducted . Mr. Zafar Mehmood, Secretary Commerce SMC 18/2010 etc.  9 
appeared with Mr. Farrukh Ahmad Hamdani, DG Commercial Audit and 
stated that an interim audit report ha d been submitted to his office 
which would  be available on the next date of hearing.  
10.   On 14.04.2011 , Mr. Zafar Ahmed  Qureshi  informed us  that 
in respect of recovery of balance amount of FIR N o.29 of 2010 
amounting to Rs.420 million , post-dated cheques were deposited by 
one Muhammad Akram Warraich (uncle of Mohsin Habib Warraich) 
before the learned Special Judge (Central) Lahore. It has been  further 
brought to our notice that  these cheques have  been dishonoured. Mr. 
Moazzam Jah on the said date of hearing informed that losses 
sustained by NICL have mostly been recovered by attaching property 
or effecting  the recovery in cash.  
11.   In the m idst of all this,  the DG, FIA,  Mr. Waseem Ahmed 
was tran sferred  and his  place was taken by Mr. Malik Muhammad 
Iqbal. Instead of facilitating  Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi in accomplishing 
the task assigned to him by this Court, Mr. Iqbal wrote a letter  dated  
15.04.2011 to Secretary Ministry of Interior stating , “…it will not be 
out of place to mention that the interim challans in NICL cases have 
been submitted in the Court of competent jurisdiction on 11.0 4.2011 
and a report thereof has already been submitted in the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan on 14 .04.2011 b y the said officer.  The 
matter is brought to your notice for further necessary action ”. The 
Ministry of Interior, through letter dated 16.04.2011 forwarded said 
letter to the Establish ment Division  and the Establishment Division,  
issued notification dated 18.04.2011 stating therein that “the DG, 
FIA has intimated that the recoveries have been made and the 
Chalan submitted in the said case. Therefore, the additional charge SMC 18/2010 etc.  10
of the officer as Additional Director General, Federal Investigation 
Agency is hereby withdrawn with immediate effect ”. 
12.  The Court was , prima facie , of the opinion that Malik 
Muhammad  Iqbal created obstacles in the investigation being 
conducted by Mr.  Zafar Ahmed Qureshi  by sending aforementioned 
letter dated 15 .04.2011. In this manner  Malik Muhammad  Iqbal had 
egregiously  flouted  the order s and direction of this Court . The Court 
was of the opinion that by disassociat ing Zafar Ahmed Qureshi from 
the case, Malik Muhammad  Iqbal was effectively committing an 
obstruction of justice.  Therefore , vide order dated 10 .05.2011, 
show -cause notice of contempt of Court was issued to Mr. Iqbal  
under Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 4 and 5 of 
the Contempt of Court Ordinance (Ordinance V) , 2003 to explain as 
to why he should not be proc eeded against for the for removing an 
officer who had been successful in implementing the directions of 
this Court.  
13.  Malik Muhammad  Iqbal, the then DG, FIA  submitted the 
reply of show -cause notice  through CMA 1836/2011 , wherein he 
averred  that on 29.04 .2011, well before the order pass ing of the 
order dated  10.05.2011, he wrote to the Secretary, Ministry of 
Interior specifically requesting that the notification in question may 
be withdrawn and the earlier notification of 24 .01.2011 be restored, 
“so that Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi may comple te the investigation as 
Member of FIA by adjusting him against the post of Additional 
Director General FIA in addition to his present assignment ”; 
however, the authority did not accept his request and Mr. Zafar SMC 18/2010 etc.  11
Qureshi was  not transferred back.  
14.  The Court was not satisfied with the explanation of Malik 
Muhammad  Iqbal . After discussing the case at length , charge was 
framed against him on 03.0 6.2011. However, in reply to the charge  
he submitted that “the undersigned holds  the apex court in the 
highest esteem and respect. I do not want to contest the charge. 
However, most respectfully I submit that it was not my intention or 
object to undermine the authority of this Hon'ble Court and subvert 
its orders/directions. I stand b y my earlier statement dated 
14.05.2011 submitted through my counsel Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan. 
I humbly and respectfully seek mercy and clemency of the august 
Court and by way of extenuating circumstance I submit that I am 
superannuating on 14 -7-2011 and I sh all immediately proceed on 
leave and not serve ”. 
15.  While hearing the contempt proceedings against Malik 
Muhammad Iqbal , notices to Mr. Qamar Zaman Ch . and Abdul  Rauf 
Chaudhry, Secretaries Interior and Establishment respectively were 
issued on 16.6.2011  to appear in Court. However , on having taken 
into consideration the facts and circumstances as well as Rules of 
Business, 1973 to meet the ends of justice it was found  necessary  to 
issue notices under section 17(1) of the Contempt of Court 
Ordinance (Ordin ance V), 2003 to both the Secretaries named 
hereinabove as well as Mr. Khushnood A khtar  Lashari,  the then 
Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister for willful defiance of the 
orders of this Court passed on 24.01.2011. Consequently, a 
separate Criminal Ori ginal Petition No.50/2011 was registered SMC 18/2010 etc.  12
against the above named three officers .  
16.  In the said situation, the  Court vide order dated 
01.07.2011 , suspended operation of notification dated 18.04.2011 
whereby services of Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi were withd rawn as 
Additional Director General, FIA . The then D.G. FIA was also 
directed t o extend all necessary assistance to him.  Strangely, on the 
same day the members of the investigation team working under the 
supervision of Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi , namely, M/s Javed Hussain, 
Dy. Director; Muhammad Ahmad, Assistant Director; Khalid Anees, 
Assistant Director; and Muhammad Sarwar, Inspector,  were 
transferred to different  stations outsid e Lahore, which also includes 
Gowadar (Balochistan)  by the then DG, FIA . 
17.  In addition to it, o n 02.07.2011, Mr. Qureshi was s erved 
with a notice to explain about the news item flashed in the electronic 
media on 02.07.2011 giving impressions that he had written a letter 
to D.G. FIA regarding transfer orders of various officers of F IA. After 
receipt of explanation, Mr. Qureshi was suspended and proceedings 
were initiated against him vide order 04.07.2011.  
18.  When the matter came u p before this Court on 
07.07.2011, the Court passed restraint orders regarding proceedings 
against Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi and the DG, FIA was directed to 
reverse the transfer orders of the officers/members of the 
investigation team of Mr.  Zafar Ahmad Qureshi immediately and 
post them at the places where they were directly performing their 
duties pending de cision of th e matter.  However, d espite restraining 
order fresh proceedings were initiated against Mr. Zafar Ahmad SMC 18/2010 etc.  13
Qureshi on the basis of some other notice. As such vide order dated 
13.07.2011 all notices and communications issued to Mr. Zafar 
Ahmad Quresh i were suspended and the Secretary 
Interior /competent authority was restrained from proceeding 
departmentally against him without prior permission of this Court.  
On 14 .07.2011 it was brought to the notice of the Court that 
officers/members of the investiga tion team of Mr. Zafar Ahmad 
Qureshi had been transferred and posted back to the places where 
they were performing duties.  
19.  It is to be noted that during the investigation of cases , 
Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi approached the Seriou s Organized Crime 
Agency (SOCA),  UK, through Mirza Sultan M. Saleem, the then 
Additional Director NCB/Interpol FIA Headquarters, and succeeded in 
obtaining information from SOCA about the bank account of Moonis 
Elahi with EFG Private Bank Ltd., having a balance of £ 1 .138 
million , in the name of a company owned by him and another 
account in the name of Beenish Khan (wife of Mohsin Habib 
Warraich) in Barclays Bank with a balance of £ 102,307.63 
(transferred from the account in EFG Private Bank Ltd.) . This fact 
has been disclosed in the report submitted in the Court on 
25.07.2011 in pursuance of earlier directions made by this Court. 
The report further indicates that the said amount has been allegedly 
transferred from NICL transactions. The said fact ha d also been 
admitted by the lear ned Attorney General for Pakistan during 
hearing of the case.  
20.  It was reported in print media on 5th and 6th July, 2011 SMC 18/2010 etc.  14
that the suspension of Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi from service was a 
result of political intervention. Reference may be made to a story  
published in the News International, wherein it was , inter alia , 
reported that “another source however insisted that the decision to 
suspend Qureshi had actually been taken in a meeting between 
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gillani, Rehman Malik and Chaudry P ervez 
Elahi”. It was also reported  in another story,  inter alia , that “one of 
the most powerful Ministers summoned the FIA Additional Director 
General Zafar Qureshi on Sunday and gave him four options: leave 
the country immediately; go on a long leave; tel l the Supreme Court 
in writing that he cannot continue with the NICL investigation for 
personal reasons; and, if all the three are not possible, then bail out 
Moonis Elahi, the son of the Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, the new 
coalition partner of the PPP governme nt, the News has learnt ”. On 
the next day it was reported, inter alia , that “Zafar Qureshi wanted 
to proceed against the former DG FIA Waseem Ahmed for not 
cooperating an d providing information about the foreign currency 
accounts of Mo onis Elahi, received by the FIA headquarter s from 
Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) UK, which delayed the 
process from reach ing its logical conclusion.  Sensing the gravity of 
the situation as Zafar Qureshi had started expanding his area of 
investigation former DG FIA , Malik Iqbal stopped him, from further 
pursuing the matter by expressing his displeasure to Zafar Qureshi 
and stating that ‘under the pretext of investigation, you have started 
inquiries about the conduct of FIA officers ’”. 
21.   In the meanwhile , propaganda  was initiated against 
judiciary on the electronic media . Therefore, on having taken into SMC 18/2010 etc.  15
consideration the above facts, on 25.07.2011 following order was 
passed: - 
“44.  In view of the above facts and circumstances, we hold 
that:- 
(1) The order dated 4 -7-2011 and or any other order, suspending 
Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi, Additional D.G. FIA from service 
have been passed to render the judgment/order dated 1 -7-
2011 ineffective and non - operative. Thus, order dated 4 -7-
2011 suspending Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi or any other order, 
is quashed/set aside. He shall be deemed to have been on 
duty as Additional D.G. FIA pursuant to the order of this Court 
dated 1 -7-2011.  
(2) Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi, Addl. D.G. is hereby directed to 
carry out investigation of the cases registe red vide F.I.Rs. 
Nos.24, 29 & 46/2010 and 05/2011 etc., forthwith. He shall 
complete investigation of the cases expeditiously.  
(3) The D.G. FIA, Additional D.G. FIA, Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi 
and other government authorities shall take steps to ensure 
that p ublic money sent abroad noted hereinabove, shall be 
brought back. The D.G. FIA and others shall not create 
hindrance in the investigation being conducted by Mr. Zafar 
Ahmad Qureshi, Addl. D.G, under the direction of this Court.  
(4) In pursuance of order da ted 13 -7-2011 passed by this Court, 
no action shall be taken against Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi 
without prior approval of this Court. The investigation team, 
which had already been assisting him, would join him as, 
team mates, unless he wants otherwise.  
(5) On having made the order dated 1 -7-2011 ineffective, prima 
facie interference has been made in the judicial functioning of 
this Court as a result whereof not only the authority of the 
Court has been eroded but at the same time the investigation 
of the NICL cases have been badly hampered, resultantly 
investigation has come to stand still, no progress has been 
made and looted money, which has been taken outside the 
country is not likely to come back unless the investigation of 
the case is conducted seriously a nd the Government provider 
support to the prosecution instead of withdrawing its support.  
(6) Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi, Addl. D.G. shall be submitting 
fortnightly report about the progress of the investigation duly 
countersigned by the D.G. FIA to Mr. Justi ce Amir Hani Muslim 
for perusal in Chambers.  
(7) Prima facie suspension order dated 4 -7-2011 of Mr. Zafar 
Ahmad Qureshi is the result of political intervention in the 
affairs of this Court and it requires to be determined 
accordingly in view of facts and c ircumstances narrated 
above, which also includes pressurizing Mr. Zafar Ahmad 
Qureshi by the high -ups to dissociate Him from the 
proceedings of the cases, as a follow up political expediency, SMC 18/2010 etc.  16
which has been widely reported by the print media, referred 
to hereinabove, coupled with propaganda on electronic media 
against judiciary by issuing advertisements. The private T.V. 
Channels might have declined to indulge in such campaign but 
the T.V. channels being operated commercially prima facie 
can not be blamed, however, the persons or a specific group 
who have provided finances for this purpose are required to 
be dealt with in accordance with law.  
22.   By means of the said order, a one-man Commission 
comprising Mr. Justice Ghulam Rabbani, former Judge of this Co urt, 
was constituted to answer the following questions: - 
(i) Whether before suspending Mr. Zafar Ahmad Qureshi, 
pressure was exerted upon him by the Interior Minister etc. as 
it has been reported in the newspapers due to political 
expediency, if so, to wha t consequences?  
(ii) Responsibility shall be fixed individually or collectively against 
the persons responsible for making investment to run the 
campaign against the judiciary on the electronic media as it 
has been noted hereinabove. On having determined t he 
particulars of the persons responsible for launching the 
propaganda campaign against the judiciary what action 
against him and or them is called for, to maintain the dignity 
and honour of the Courts.  
23.   The Commission submitted its report in a sealed  envelop 
which was opened in Court on 07.06.2012 and was registered as CMA 
No. 2324/2012 ordered to be made public.  
24.  It is to be observed that the persons,  who had a stake 
against the fair investigation by Mr. Qureshi, continued their efforts to 
keep him away from the investigation and made another attempt for 
the purpose of rendering his efforts ineffective . When  the Court 
insisted on providing him the team  which was associated with him  
earlier , the members of the team were  brought back to Lahore but 
they were sent on leave. Inasmuch as , when Zafar Ahmed Qureshi SMC 18/2010 etc.  17
after reporting his arrival on 11.08.2011 decided to go to his  office at 
Lahore on 13.08.2011, a night before on 12.08.2011 at about 8/9 
p.m. one Khawaja Hammad, Assistant Director, FIA informe d him on 
telephone that he should not go to office because there is a rumor  of 
planting of bomb in the building but despite that he went to office and 
noticed that building of the FIA was locked although few officers were 
present inside the building. Nonet heless, despite his best efforts he 
was not even allowed to enter the building to perform his duties as per 
the order of this Court . Even the files of the case under investigation 
were made available to him. Surprisingly, the then DG FIA, who was 
directed to extend his cooperation to him stated that he had no 
knowledge about the same. Therefore, the police registered the case 
under section 25/D/29 of the Telegraph Act r/w  sections 182/186 PPC , 
in Police Station Civil Lines, Lahore. Further, t he leaves grant ed to the 
Staff attached with Zafar Ahmed Qureshi were cancelled and files were 
handed over to him to continue the investigation.  
25.  It is interesting to not e that during the period of 
dissociation of Zafar Ahmed  Qureshi from the investigation of case 
w.e.f. 19.04.2011 to 13 .08.2011 , an amount of Rs.1 .895 million lying 
in bank account of Agro Tractors Pvt. Ltd. maintained in Al-Barka Bank 
and an amount of Rs .18.522 million  lying in the account of M/s Al-
Tahur (Pvt) Ltd.  maintained in Allied Bank , which w ere fr ozen, prima 
facie, considering the same  to be subject matter of FIRs No.29/11, 
5/11 and 46/2010 , were illegally  activated  without following the 
procedure by Zulfiqar Ali , one of the members of the then investigation 
team with the approval of Waqar Ha ider, Director FIA. On query, Mr. 
Waqar Haider stated that accounts were activated  on the following SMC 18/2010 etc.  18
opinion of Zulfiqar Ali: - 
“I have gone through the papers. Notice under section 5(5) of 
FIA Act was given on 30.3.2011 regarding stoppage of M/s Agro 
Tracto r Accounts maintained in Al -Barka Bank Gulberg Branch 
Lahore being related with case F.I.R. No.46/2010 and 5/2011 of 
FIA/Circle Lahore. Perusal of the file reveals that the said 
account has no nexus with the above said case. The I.O has not 
got regularized  the notice from  the competent court. Thus, 
notice has no legal value  which can be withdrawn.  
If approved, the I.O. maybe directed to withdraw the notice 
dated 30.3.2011 issued u/s 5(5) of FIA Act. ” 
However, directions were made to bring back this amount forthwith 
and deposit the same in  the accounts noted hereinabove, treating it to 
be case property. The o rder was complied with  by the concerned 
authorities .  
26.  It is interesting to note that one of the accused Moonis 
Elahi, who was challaned in cases No . 46/2010 & 05/2011 , was 
acquitted of the charge by the Banking Court  vide judgment dated 
21.10.2011 . It seems that against the acquittal , no appeal was filed by 
the prosecution.  
27.  At that stage i.e. around 15.11.2011 , Mr. Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi , attain ed the age of superannuation and retired. Subsequent 
thereto, except filing the report by commission comprising Mr. Justice 
(R) Ghulam Rabbani , no effective proceedings have been made  and all 
the accused persons were released on bail . The accused failed to ma ke 
payment of balance amount of Rs.420 million as the cheques issued by 
Akram Warraich, reference of which finds mentioned in the order dated 
14.04.2011, were dishonoured and a criminal case under section    SMC 18/2010 etc.  19
489-F PPC was got registered vide FIR dated 20.06 .2012, however, he 
challenged the proceedings before the High Court, where the same are 
pending.  
28.  We have heard the learned Additional Attorney General 
who has appeared on behalf of FIA, Mr. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, 
former Secretary Interior (presently h olding the post of Chairman 
NAB), Mr. Abdul Rauf Chaudhry, former Secretary Establishment (now 
appointed as Federal Tax Ombudsman). Mr. Khushnood Ahmed Lashari 
has not attended the Court.  
29.  On behalf of FIA, it is argued that efforts have been made 
for procuring the attendance of three persons who are outside the 
country and as far as the persons namely Mohsin Warraich, Javed 
Shah, Qasim Amin Dada  and Khawaja Butt  involved in FIRs 
No.24/2010, 29/2010 and 5/2012  are concerned, they  have not been 
arrested . It has been noted with great concern that Mr. Qudratullah , 
incumbent Director FIA Lahore , has  absolutely no interest in 
finalization of the case s and he had exhibited reluctant attitude instead 
of asserting t he enforce ment of  the law for completion of th e 
investigation of the case by causing t he arrest of the accused persons , 
named hereinabove, from within and outside the country,  and als o to 
make efforts to ensure the recovery of Rs.420 million a s well as  to 
make arrangements for ensuring the return of t he money lying in the 
accounts of  accused out side the country especially in UK, in respect 
whereof a letter dated  26.01.2011 had als o been received by FIA from 
SOCA at the ti me when Mr. Waseem Ahmed was DG  FIA, who 
reportedly without any authori ty retaine d that document in his SMC 18/2010 etc.  20
possession for some time and perhaps later on shared information 
about the receipt of the document but no action was taken to retrieve  
the amount belonging to nation lying  in the foreign bank s. We may 
mention that one report dated  18.07.2012 has been submitted, 
wherein it was stated that no case is made out regarding money 
laundering against Moonis Elahi, therefore , vide order dated 
19.07.2012  this Court observed that for such report no action is called 
for at that stage.  
30.    Likew ise, despite alleged efforts of Moazzam Ja h, Director 
FIA Karachi, as per reports, one of the accused in Karachi Land Scam 
Khalid Anwar has not been brought from outside the country.  
31.  Indifferent  attitude of FIA  Authorities noted above and 
other gover nment functionaries i.e. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, the then 
Secretary Interior, Abdul Rauf Chaudhry, former Secretary 
Establishment and Khushnood Akhtar Lashari, Principal Secretary to 
Prime Minister and others  is quite understandable , if same is 
examined, ke eping view the overall circumstances of the case 
commencing from 19.04.2011 to 13.08.2011 , when Mr. Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi former Add l. DG, FIA was kept disassociated , in clandestine 
manner  from investigation of case , as it has been noted hereinabove, 
all pos sible unauthorized tactics were used to create obstacles to 
prevent him to conduct investigation transparently, det ail whereof is 
self explanatory .   
32.  It is to be noted that in the meanwhile, on 24.05.2012 it 
was informed by Mr. Moazzam Jah, Director F IA that out of the money  
belonging to NICL an amount of Rs.40.50 million was deposited in the SMC 18/2010 etc.  21
joint account of the then Commerce Minister Amin Fahim , who later on 
also obtain ed an ex -parte degree on 16.6. 2012 passed in suit 
No.793/2011.  It is stated that t he said Minister got Ayyaz  Khan Niazi  
appointed as  Chairman NICL in pursuance of the summary put up 
before him and subsequent thereto notification of his appointment was 
issued on 12.12.2012.  
33.  Vide notification dated 07.02.2009 by the Establishment 
Division on the summary, which was forwarded to it by the Minister for 
Commerce, Mr. Makhdoom Amin  Fahim , Prima facie his appointment 
has been made contrary to the Civil Servants’ (Appointment, 
Promotions and Transfers) Rules, 1973 because for appointment on  
contract these rules are applicable as it is stated in the summary 
submitted by Tariq Zubair Khan, Section Officer (Insurance), Ministry 
of Commerce in the following para: - 
“3. The post of Chairman, NICL can be filled from officer of (BS -
21/22) or also to  be filled in from private sector on contract basis in 
accordance with the Policy Guidelines for appointments in 
Autonomous/Semi autonomous Bodies circulated by Establishment 
Division vide their OM No.6/2/200 -R3 dated 6th May, 2000 and

and 
above  Minister  - Chairman  
Secretary  - Member  
J.S.(Admn)  - Member -
cum-   Secretary  
 
 SMC 18/2010 etc.  22
34.   One of the most important question s relates to the 
appointment of Ayyaz  Khan Niazi to the post of Chairman NICL, which 
was lyi ng vacant since 15.12 .2008 due to transfer of Mr. Abid  Javed 
Akbar.  
35.   Mr. Tariq Zubair Kha n, Section Officer moved summary on 
22.01.2009 wherein he submitted following order of priority of the 
candidates for appointment as Chairman, NICL: - 
(i) Muhammad Anisul Hussain, (BS -21), Additional Secretary, 
M/o Commerce;  
(ii) Mr. Naveed Arif (BS -21), Commerce &  Trade Group 
Officer, Ministry of Commerce; and  
(iii) Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz  Niazi, Director, Team Lead Pakistan, 
Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore  
 
The Additional Secretary (Implementation), on the said summary 
observed that “a summary for PM to post Chairman NICL is su bmitted 
for approval/signature please ”. The Secretary on the said summary 
observed that “Minister may see and approve before submission ” . The 
Minister for Commerce approved the summary on 23.01.2009.  
36.    In the light of the approval of the Minister fo r Commerce, 
the summary for approval of the Prime Minister was prepared on 
24.01.2009 by Mr. Suleman  Ghani, Secretary Commerce, wherein 
order  above of priority was changed and mentioned as under: - 
(i) Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz  Niazi, Director, Team Lead Pakistan, 
Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore;  
(ii) Mr. Naveed Arif (BS -21), Commerce & Trade Group 
Officer, Ministry of Commerce; and  
(iii) Muhammad Anisul Hussain, (BS -21), Additional Secretary, 
M/o Commerce  
 SMC 18/2010 etc.  23
The said summary was sent to Establishment Division for its onward 
transmis sion to Princip al Secretary to the Prime Minister. On 
07.02.2009 under the signatures of Mr. Ismail Qureshi, the then 
Establishment Secretary added following paras: - 
“7. Out of the panel proposed by the Ministry of Commerce, 
Mr. Naveed Arif, a BS -21 office r of Commerce & Trade Group 
has been recently posted as Additional Secretary (Inchar ge), 
Ministry of Zakat & Ushr (annexure -I). Moreover, Mr.Muhammad 
Ayaz Niazi is from private sector and can be appointed as 
Chairman, National Insurance Company Limited (NI CL), Karachi. 
According to contract policy, appointments on contract have to 
be made in accordance with Civil Servants (Appointment, 
Promotion & Transfer) Rules, 1973, which lay down that the 
post should be advertised.  
8. Proposal of Ministry of Commerce contained in para 4 of 
the Summary read with para 7 above is submitted for kind 
orders of the Prime Minister. ” 
 
The Summary was forwarded to Prime Minister’s Secretariat where on 
10.02.2009 , Ms. Nargis Sethi, Acting Principal Secretary to PM 
informed as fo llows: - 
“9. The Prime Minister has been pleased to approve the 
appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ayyaz Niazi, as Chairman, 
National Insurance Company Limited (NICL) on contract 
basis on standard terms & conditions. ” 
37.   It is necessary to examine further the d ocuments available 
on record, as according to them, Qamar Zaman Chaudhry was the 
Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce and when the file 
was placed before him for approval a name out of the p anel of three 
persons , instead of ensuring  transparen cy in appointment to the 
vacant position of the Chairman NICL through advertisement in 
newspaper, he forwarded the same for the approval  of the Minister of SMC 18/2010 etc.  24
Commerce,  Makhdoom Amin Fahim , as a result whereof the process 
was tainted with arbitrariness . After  approval of the Commerce 
Minister, the summary was endorsed by Suleman  Ghani, Former 
Secretary Commerce as well as by the Commerce Minister and the 
Prime Minister approved the same . As a result , Mr. Ayyaz Khan was 
appointed, although his name was at seria l No.3 and the remaining 
two persons named above were already enjoying the status of BS -21.  
38.   In his concise statement (CMA 2272/2012), Makhdoom 
Amin Fahim , the then Minister for Commerce stated that he exercised 
his powers in a bona fide  manner as he  forward ed the summary to the 
competent authority hence he committed no illegality .  He averred that 
the process of appointment of Chairman NICL was done by the 
Ministry in due course (not by himself) in accordance with the Rules of 
Business. As far as rec eiving the amount of Rs.4.50 million he 
explained that his family members had mortgaged their three 
immovable properties as sureties in Union Bank (presently Standard 
Charted Bank) for repayment of loan amount obtained from  the same  
bank. The installments of loan amount w ere payable by petitioner and 
his family as per bank schedule but due to loss caused to petitioner 
and his family in their agricultural crops, they were unable to pay the 
installments with in stipulated time. The Bank Authorities issued 
several notices to petitioner and i mplored  them to ensure the payment 
of installment according to schedule. He and his family decided to sale 
out one of their immovable mortgaged property, in this connection he 
and his family empowered their Manager namely Al i Hassan Hingorjo 
to make sale transaction of one of their mortgaged property. Mr. 
Muhammad Zafar Saleem approached Mr. Ali Hassan Hingorjo and SMC 18/2010 etc.  25
showed his interest to purchase the Mortgaged Bungalow No.75/1, 
25th street Phase 6 DHA Karachi, and after long bargaining they settled 
the sale transaction. Mr. Zafar Saleem offered to purchase the said 
Bungalow  for sale consideration of Rs.76 millions, and both parties 
entered into a sale agreement/contract dated 23.01.2009.  The 
vendee at the time of agreement pa id Rs.3.5 million as earnest money 
and the remaining amount was to be paid in accordance with the 
terms and condition of agreem ent/contract. Vendee was bound to pay 
the balance amount within twelve months i.e.22.01.2010 and vendor 
was to transfer the above  property in the name of vendee or his 
nominee, failing which it was agreed between both parties that the 
earnest money shall be confiscated and agreement would be 
terminated and defaulter would pay 10% of total sale consideration 
amount paid to vendor. In  the meanwhile, the bank authorities 
pressurized the petitioner and his family to repay the full and final loan 
amount against all properties mortgaged in the bank. Therefore, the 
vendee Zafar Saleem made the payment of Rs.41 million as part 
payment of sal e consideration through a cheque of Dubai Islamic 
Bank, which was directly deposited in Standard Chartered Bank in 
order to settle the loan amount against the mortgaged properties as 
per terms agreed by the Bank and informed the bank the remaining 
loan amo unt would be settled shortly as possible . On the other side , 
his Manager and vendee mutually agreed that when the remaining sale 
consideration amount would be paid by the vendee to the Standard 
Chartered Bank, title of property under sale would be transfer red in his 
favour. Thereafter, Zafar Saleem died in a plan crash in July 2010 . 
Therefore, he approached to the legal heirs of the said vendee to SMC 18/2010 etc.  26
finalize the contract and he also issued the legal notices through his 
advocate to the legal heirs of the vende e to perform their part of 
contract but they failed to abide by the conditions,  in light of which suit 
No.793/2011 for declaration, compensation, damage, cancellation and 
permanent injunction in the High Court of Sindh was filed and 
ultimately de cree was ob tained.  
Whereas on the other hand Moazzam Jah, Director FIA has 
explained as follows: - 
“Makhdoom Amin Faheem  and his family obtained loans from 
M/s      Standard Chartered Bank detailed out as follows: - 
a) Mrs. Rizwana Amin obtained a loan of Rs.25,064.073/ -

15.10.2008, last installment to the tune of Rs.1 52.114.76 
was made. Presently the outstanding amount is 
Rs.49,436,034.36. ” 
FINDINGS OF FIA   
 Regarding the appointment of Ayaz Khan Niazi, it appears 
prima facie that the said appointment was made in SMC 18/2010 etc.  27
contravention of the Insurance Ordinance, without public ation of 
any advertisement or soliciting applications for such senior post 
and without conducting the fit and proper test or following any 
laid down criteria. The biggest question that arises is how his 
name figured in the summary moved to the Prime Minist er for 
such appointment. Admittedly he had no background of 
Insurance business and was not such a prominent person 
wherein some officer could just read about him in the papers 
and place his name at the top of the recommended list of 
nominees for such a pre stigious appointment. An enquiry being 
conducted by Secretary Commerce should reveal full facts but 
so far what has emerged does not absolve the Commerce 
Ministry from acts of favourtism, which subsequently resulted in 
financial impropriety and outright in dulgence in acts of 
corruption.  
  Accused Ayaz Khan Niazi after assuming the charge of 
chairman of NICL went on a money minting spree including the 
purchase of 10 Acre land on exaggerated prices (Case FIR 
No.21/2010 as stated above) causing wrongful loss to public 
exchequer and corresponding wrongful gain to himself and 
others.  
 In the transaction of Rs.41 Million from the account of 
accused Khawaja Akbar Butt credited into the loan account of 
Makhdoom Amin Faheem , it has been observed that the 
arrangement  is not as innocent as it looks. Prima facie, the 
agreement of sale of property is fabricated to hoodwink the 
authorities. It appears to be a device to justify the landing of a 
huge sum of money from the accounts of an accused beneficiary 
of this Mega Scam .  
RECOVERY  
 Against the loss of Rs.487.4 Million caused to public 
exchequer, an amount of Rs.490 Million has been recovered in 
the shape of cash and deposited in the accounts of M/s NICL 
and Mr. Syed Aslam Raja, Executive Director M/s NICL vide his 
letter  dated 21.12.2011 has confirmed that an amount of 
Rs.490 Million has been transferred in the account of M/s NICL 
and the entire loss to the Government Exchequer has been 
recovered. Additionally, properties valuing more than Rs.500 
Million  have also been a ttached through Section 5(5) of FIA Act 
1974 and confirmed by Honourable trial Court as well.  
 The Federal Investigation Agency gives an assurance to 
the Apex Court that FIA has conducted the investigation fairly, 
on merit and strictly in accordance with l aw and shall pursue the 
prosecution in the same manner before the honourable trial 
Court. ” 
 
39.  As has been pointed out  above,  NICL was established 
under National Insurance Act, 1976 but later on converted into Public 
Limited Company under the National In surance Company SMC 18/2010 etc.  28
(Reorganization) Ordinance, 2000. Section 12 of the Ordinance, 2000 
provides for the appointment of Directors and Principal Officers, who 
comply with the criteri a envisaged by the said section . According to 
the stand taken by SECP on the ap pointment of Ayyaz Khan Niazi as 
Chairman NICL , the above criteria were not forwarded to it and the 
Ministry of Commerce got him approved without any involvement 
whatsoever of the SECP .    
40.  It has been disclosed that vide SRO No.708(I )/2009 dated 
27.07 .2009 the process of wide consultation  was started for the 
formulation and sound and prudent management standard containing 
the ‘fit and proper’ criteria in term s of section 12 of NICL Ordinance.    
41.   It seems that after appointment of Mr. Ayyaz Khan N iazi, 
he is allegedly involved in the scam spread ing over billions of rupees . 
Cases have been registered against him at Lahore and Karachi and at 
present five persons , whose names have already been mentioned 
hereinabove, could not be repatriated to Pakista n and according to 
special audit report of NICL following amounts are recoverable: -

42.   As it has been noted in detail , Mr. Qureshi, former 
Additional Director FIA thoroughly conducted investigation , in 
pursuance whereof one Moonis Elahi was also involved in FIR s No. 24, 
29 & 46 of 2010 and 05 of 2011 under section s 409, 420, 109 PPC 
read with 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act,  1947 etc. and trail of 
transactions between Mohsin Habib Warraich and him, prima facie 
proved the use of government money, which had  been received from 
NICL. It has also came to  notice of FI A through SOCA who informed to 
Muhammad Saleem, Additional Director that there were vast amounts 
of money lying in the account s of Moonis Elahi , Mohsin Habib Warraich 
(who is still an absconder) and their family members. Mr. Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi was making serious efforts  in this regard. However, his 
services as Additional Director General, FIA were inexplicably 
withdrawn vide  notification  dated 18. 04.2011 , which is reproduced 
hereinbelow: - 
“F. No. 12/3/81 -E-3 (Police)  
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN  
CABINET SECRETAR IAT 
ESTABLISHMENT DIVISION  
*****  
 
Islamabad, the 18th April, 2011  
 
NOTIFICATION  
Capt. (Ret d) Zafar Ahmed Qureshi (PSP/BS -21) was posted as 
Additional Director General, Federal Investigation Agency, 
under Ministry of Interior, in addition to his present 
assignment as Managing Director, National Police Foundation, 
to/supervise the investigation of NICL case vide this Division's 
Notification of even number, dated 24 -1-2011.  SMC 18/2010 etc.  30
 
2. The Director General, Federal Investigation Agency has 
intimated that the recoverie s have been made and the Chalan 
submitted in the said case. Therefore, the additional charge of 
the officer as Additional Director General, Federal 
Investigation Agency is hereby withdrawn with immediate 
effect.  
 
(Sd.)  
(Shahzad Asif)  
Section Officer to the  
Government of Pakistan ” 
 
43.  It is pertinent to mention that merely three days before 
the issuance of the above notification, Malik Muhammad Iqbal wrote a 
letter dated 15.04.2011 to the Secretary, Ministry of Interior informing 
him that interim challans had been submitted in the court of 
competent jurisdiction on 11.04.2011 and a report thereof had already 
been submitted in this Court on 14.04 .2011 by Mr. Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi. A  perusal of the said letter suggests that there was no 
occasion for addressing a letter to the Secretary Ministry of Interior, 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad because FIA is an independent 
entity and its affairs are run by  the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 
1974, a perusal where of abundantly makes it clear that FIA is an 
Agency for making investigation regarding certain offences committed 
in connection with matters concerning the Federal Government and the 
matters connected therewith. The Federal G overnment has been 
authorized to constitute  an Agency for inquiry and investigation  of the 
offences specified in the schedule , etc. The Federal Government , 
except  for enjoying superintendence and administration of the Agency , 
has not been empowered to interfere  in the independent  and 
transparent investigation of cases, particularly when there are 
allegations against any person(s) of corruption or corrupt practices, or 
covered by any of the provisions of the schedule . In any case , this SMC 18/2010 etc.  31
letter was not meant for any further correspond ing transmission 
because it is now settled law that invest igation/inquiry is required to 
be conducted independently without any influence/  interference of any 
third party like Government.  
44.  Surprisingly, to achieve alleged object of disassociating 
Zafar Ahmed Qureshi from the investigation  by getting him 
transferred,  Mr. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry forwarded th e said  letter to 
the Establishment Division , stating therein that “please find enclosed 
the reference received from the Director General regarding latest 
position of the investigation in NICL case at Lahore ”. It seems that 
Malik Muhammad Iqbal  titled this document as ‘Notification’ , obviously 
with an intention to convey to the Ministry that some notification is 
required to be issued. It may not be out of place to mention that prior 
to the appointment of Malik Mu hammad Iqbal  as DG FIA , Mr. Zafar 
Qureshi was disassociated from the case but on the intervention of the  
Court , Mr. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, who was Secretary Interior at that 
time, cancelled the notification of his transfer and he was reposted on 
24.01.2011 for the purpose of conducting investigation. However, 
instead of app roachin g the Court to inquire about his  further 
requirement to investigate the case or to get him relieved by getting 
Court order, a letter was sent in uncalled  haste to the Secretary 
Establishment, Mr. Abdul Rauf Chaudhry who forwarded the same to 
the then Prime Minister without sending any summary or apprising him 
that Mr.  Zafar Ahmed Qureshi had  been attached with the 
investigation of the case on the intervention of the Court in order to  
investigate the allegations of corruption . Admittedly , on 18.04.20 11, 
during night time at about 9/10 pm the above noted  notification was SMC 18/2010 etc.  32
issued , in pursuance of verbal order , and subsequently summary was 
allegedly got approved on 20.04.2011. It would be appropriate to note 
its contents for the sake of convenience :- 
“SUMMARY FOR THE PRIME MINISTER  
Subject: Withdrawal of additional charge – Capt. (R) 
Zafar Ahmed Qureshi (PSP/BS -21) 
Ministry of Interior vide their U.O. No.3/6/2011 -Estt. FIA,  
dated 16.04.2011  (Annex -I) forwarded letter 
No.PS/DG/FIA/2011/2008, dated 15.04.2011 of Federal 
Investigation  Agency (FIA) on the above subject. The FIA 
correspondence refers to Establishment Division’s 
Notification No.F.12/3/81 -E-3 (Police) dated 24.1.2011 
(Annex -II) re garding posting of Capt.(R)  Zafar Ahmed 
Qureshi (PSP/BS -21) as member of the FIA against the 
post of  Additional Director General/FIA , in addition to his 
present assignment as Managing Director, National Police 
Foundation, so as to supervise the investigati on of NICL 
case at Lahore. It further stated that interim challans in 
NICL case have been submitted in the Court of competent 
jurisdiction on 11.04.2011 and a report thereof had 
already been submitted in the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
on 14.04.2011 by the s aid officer, and the matter  is 
brought to the notice of Ministry of Interior for further 
necessary action. The Ministry of Interior forwarded the 
FIA’s letter to the Establishment Division for further 
necessary action. Subsequently this Divis ion was verbal ly 
informed that the required recoveries have already been 
affected from the accused persons.  
2. In view of the position and in pursuance of the 
directions of the Prime Minister’s Secretariat (Public), the 
additiona l charge of Capt.(Retd) Zafar Ahmed Question  
(PSP/BS -21) as Additional Director General Investigation 
Agency, has been withdrawn with immediate effect. A 
Copy of notification is at Annex -III. 
3. Position in preceding paras is submitted for 
confirmation of orders of Prime Minister’s Secretariat.  
 
(Abdul  Rauf Chaudhry)  
Establishment Secretary ” 
 
 
It is to be noted that there was no such urgency to obtain order of his 
transfer on 18.04.2011 during night time at 9/10 pm and in this behalf 
no explanation has been put forward. Similarly, reference of obtaining  
verbal order normally is pressed into service where there is acute SMC 18/2010 etc.  33
urgency  and without getting transfer order there is likelihood of 
receiving serious threat to nation al security etc. otherwise Rule 5 
(11A) of the Rules of Business, 1973 is sufficient to rebut the 
contention raised by him according to which  if there is an urgency and 
it is not possible to obtain written confirmation of the orders before 
initiating action, the functionary to whom the verbal order s are given 
shall take the action required a nd at the first available opportunity, 
obtain the requisite confirmation while submitting  to the issuing 
authority a report of the action taken by him.  Thus, it is held that in 
future as well, the concerned authorities are required to follow the 
Rules of B usiness strictly, particularly, relevant clause referred and 
discussed herein above.  
45.  Mr. Khushnood Lashari, Principal S ecretary to the Prime 
Minister has  taken the stand that the plain reading of FIA’s 
letter/report dated 15.04.2011 addressed to the Secretary Interior, 
forwarded to Establishment Division , suggested that additional charge 
assigned to Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi in FIA was no longer required 
otherwise there was no other purpose of that letter at all. And that in 
furtherance of the said lett er, he only conveyed to Establishment  
Secretary the directions of the competent authority that necessary 
notification be issued. Accordingly, notification was issued and the 
confirmation of the verbal orders of the competent authority was 
obtained in terms  of rules 5(11 -A) and 15(4) of the Rules of business, 
1973 which cater for implementation of verbal orders of the competent 
authority first and later obtaining the confirmation thereon. As such, 
according to him, he never defied the orders of this Court by  any 
action verbal or written. All actions taken by him were done in good SMC 18/2010 etc.  34
faith, keeping in view  the dignity of the Court and in accordance with 
Rules of Business.  
46.   It is pertinent to note that the mandatory provisions of rule 
5(11A) of the Rules of Business, 1973 have been completely ignored 
by the aforementioned persons. The said Rule provides that, “V erbal 
orders given by a functionary of the Government should as a matter of 
routine be reduced to writing and submitted to the issuing authority. If 
time permits, the confirmation shall invariably be taken before 
initiating action. However, in an exigency where action is required to 
be taken immediately or it is not possible to obtain written 
confirmation of the orders before initiating action, the func tionary to 
whom the verbal orders are given shall take the action required and at 
the first available opportunity obtain the requisite confirmation while 
submitting to the issuing authority a report of the action taken by 
him.” 
47.   It would not be out of  context to note that Malik 
Muhammad Iqbal filed reply through CMA No. 1836/2011, i n response 
to contempt  notice. Relevant paras therefrom are reproduced 
hereinbelow: - 
“5. It is most respectfully submitted that this letter was not  
written either to procure  or seek the transfer of Capt (R) Zafar 
Ahmed Qureshi or to have him relieved of the  additional charge 
as Additional Director General Federal Investigation Agency.  
 
6. It may further be stated that in the said letter all that was  
stated merely by way of information was, “that the interim 
challans in NICL cases have been submitted in the Court of 
competent jurisdiction on 11.4.2011 and a report thereof has 
already been submitted in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan on 14.4.2011 by the said officer. ” This was a mere 
narration of facts. No request was made in this letter or 
otherwise by me to have Mr. Qureshi relieved of his duties as an 
Additional Director of the Federal Investigation Agency 
investigation the NICL cases.  
 SMC 18/2010 etc.  35
7. That on receipt of this lett er the Additional Secretary, 
Ministry of Interior by his letter of 16th April, 2011, informed 
the Establishment Division about the receipt of this letter and, 
to the best of my understanding regarded it simply as a 
communication “regarding the latest posit ion of investigation in 
NICL case at Lahore ”. A copy of this letter is ANNEX ”B”.  
 
8. That in its notification of 18 April 2011, ANNEX “C”, the 
Establishment Division, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of 
Pakistan observed that I have “intimated that the rec overies 
have been made and the Challan submitted in the said case. ” 
The Establishment Division, according to it, therefore, “withdrew 
the additional charge of the officer as Additional Director 
General, Federal Investigation Agency…. ” 
 
9. That it is most r espectfully submitted that there is a  
significant difference between a “Challan ” and an “Interim 
Challan ”. The former expression may mean a final challan but 
the latter expression does not. It is also clear that while an 
investigation may come to an end on  the submission of a final 
challan it does not terminate on the submission of an interim 
challan. I had, therefore, used the cautious and correct latter 
expression in my letter of 15th April, 2011, and had not used the 
former expression. It is  submitted th at the Establishment 
Division has incorrectly attributed the use of the expression 
“Challan’ to me. I never used this word.  
 
10. It is also humbly and most respectfully stated that I had 
not used the words, “recoveries have been made: in my letter of 
15 April, 2011. Even a cursory glance at my letter of 15 April, 
2011 will make it abundantly clear that I had not used these or 
even any similar words. These words have been incorrectly 
attributed to me by the Establishment Division, for reasons best 
known to it.  
 
11. I also voluntarily state that I had not used these words in 
any other communication, either verbal or written, in respect of 
this matter. Being a senior officer and being fully conscious of 
the sensitivities of this case I could not have dared us e such 
loose and incorrect expressions.  
 
12. On 29 April, 2011, well before the order passed by this 
Hon’ble Court on 10 May 2011, I wrote to the Secretary, 
Ministry of Interior specifically requesting that the notification in 
question may be withdrawn an d the earlier notification of 24 
January, 2011 be restored, “so that Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi 
may complete the investigation as Member of FIA by adjusting 
him against the post of Additional Director General FIA in 
addition to his present  
assignment. ”  
 
13. That on 5 May, 2011 in its letter, ANNEX “D: addressed to 
the Secretary, Establishment, the Ministry of Interior endorsed 
my request and attached another copy of it with this letter. ” 
 
48.  This reply was consider ed unsatisfactory . On 3.06.2011 
charge was  framed against him, who replied as follows: - SMC 18/2010 etc.  36
“Respectfully submitted that the undersigned holds the apex 
court in the highest esteem and respect. I do not want to 
contest the charge. However, most respectfully I submit that it 
was not my intention or obje ct to undermine the authority of 
this Honourable Court and subvert its orders/directions. I stand 
by my earlier statement dated 14.5.2011 submitted through my 
counsel Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan. I humbly and respectfully seek 
mercy and clemency of the August Co urt and by way of 
extenuating circumstance I submit that I am superannuating on 
14.7.2011 and I shall immediately proceed on leave and not 
serve .”  
 
49.   Arguments were heard in contempt case but judgment was 
not announced until the proceedings against  Qamar Zaman Ch, 
Secretary, Ministry of Interior; Abdul Rauf   
Chaudhry  Secretary, Establishment Division; and Khushnood Lashari, 
Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, for willful defiance of the 
orders of this Court passed on 24.1.2011, were not complete d. 
50.    The detail s noted hereinabove furnish sufficient ground to 
hold that  the conduct of Mr. Qamar Zaman Chaudhry , Abdul Rauf 
Chaudhry and Khushnood Akhtar Lashari  was a prima facie violation  of 
section 17 (1) of the Contempt Of Court Ordinance, 2003.   
51.    There is another important question . This Court tried to 
ensure that FIA should  conduct investigation in NICL scam honestly 
through an independent officer but attempts were made to abo rt all 
such effort s. Thus, this Court had to exercise jurisdicti on in the light of 
the law laid down in a number of judgments wherein it has been held 
that this Court is not debarred from ensuring fair investigation of the 
case, without any other intention except with object to bring to book 
the persons who were involv ed in corruption and corrupt practices, 
whosoever or how influential he may be, without any discrimination . 
Reference may be made to the case of Vineet Narain v. Union of India  SMC 18/2010 etc.  37
(AIR 1998 SC 889), commonly known as ‘Jan Havala case’, wherein 
the Court obser ved as under :- 
“8. The sum and substance of these orders is that the 
CBI and other Governmental agencies had not carried out 
their public duty to investigate the offences disclosed; that 
none stands above the law so that an alleged offence by 
him is not re quired to be investigated; that we would 
monitor the investigations, in the sense that we would do 
what we permissibly could to see that the investigations 
progressed while yet ensuring that we did not direct or 
channel those investigations or in any other  manner 
prejudice the right of those who might be accused to a full 
and fair trial. We made it clear that the task of the 
monitoring court would and the moment a charge -sheet 
was filed in respect of a particular investigation and that 
the ordinary processe s of the law would then take over. 
Having regard to the direction in which the investigations 
were leading, we found it necessary to direct the CBI not 
to report the progress of the investigations to the person 
occupying the highest office in the political  executive . This 
was done to eliminate any impression of bias or lack of 
fairness or objectivity and to maintain the credibility of the 
investigations. In short, the procedure adopted was of 
“continuing mandamus ”.” 
 
52.   This principle has also been follo wed in the case of Bank of 
Punjab  v. Haris Steel  (PLD 2010 SC 1109 ), wherein it was observed 
that not only a colossal amount of money  and property belonging to a 
large section of the public but the very existence of the Bank of Punjab 
was at stake. T hus, it was not only the right of the Court but in fact its 
onerous obligation was to intervene to forestall the assault on the said 
fundamental right to life and property of the public. In yet another 
case Watan Party v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 201 2 SC 292) SMC 18/2010 etc.  38
following the above principle this Court constituted a commission to 
inquire into th e authenticity of a m emorandum  which allegedly  
affected the sovereignty, independence and security of Pakistan and to 
determine civil and criminal liability  based on  forensic evidence and 
other material . 
53.  The actions of public servants who abet corruption are 
countenanced generally by sections 34, 107, 108, 109 and 119 of the 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (PPC) and specifically by section 9(a)(vi) of 
NAB Ordinance, 1999. Se ction 34 of the PPC deals with the 
commission of crimes by more than one person with a common 
intention and the other sections deal with the liability for abetment of 
crimes. Section 119 deals with public servants who facilitate the 
commission of offences which it is their duty to prevent. In this regard 
it is useful to refer to the definition of “public servant” as given in the 
case of P. V. Narasimha Rao v. State  (AIR 1998 Supreme Court 2120): 
“A public servant is any person who holds an office by virtue of which 
he is authorised or requi red to perform any public duty.”  The 
jurisprudence of the mentioned sections of the PPC are helpful in 
addressing the legal questions in the instant case, but it must be kept 
in mind that according to section 3 of the NAB Ordinance, “ The 
provisions of this Ordinance shall have effect notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force .” Therefore, with 
due deference to the maxim lex specialis derogate legi generali  
(special law derogates general law), it is section 9(a)(vi) of NAB 
Ordinance, 1999 that is squarely applicable in the instant case. The 
said section reads as under:  SMC 18/2010 etc.  39
“Section 9 (a) A holder of a public office, or any other person, 
is said to commit or to have committed the offence of cor ruption 
and corrupt practices - 
(vi)  if he misuses his authority so as to gain any benefit or 
favour for himself or any other person, or  renders or attempts 
to render  or wilfully fails to exercise his authority to prevent the 
grant, or rendition of any und ue benefit or favour which he 
could have prevented by exercising his authority...”  
It is clear from the words “ or renders or attempts to render  or wilfully 
fails to exercise his authority to prevent the grant, or rendition of any 
undue benefit or favour ” that section 9(a)(vi) covers crimes committed 
with a common intention as well as abetment.  
54.  The liability of those who abet in the commission of crimes 
and commit crimes with common intention has been dilated upon in 
the cases mentioned hereinbelow:  
1. Muhammad Ali v. The State  (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 667)  
“5. It is worth mentioning here at this juncture that the 
alleged offence and its mode of commission fall within the ambit 
of "white collar crime" which has its own salient features and 
peculiar characte ristic and therefore, a line of distinction is to be 
drawn between an ordinary offence and that of a "white collar, 
crime' which is to be kept in view while evaluating the evidence 
and approach for such evaluation must be dynamic so that 
conjectural presum ptions and hyper technical hitches having no 
nexus with the merits of the case could be eliminated.  
 
6. The inspection of the spot where new telephone is to be 
installed and testing of new installation are required to be done 
by the SDO and Engineering Sup ervisor. It would be too much to 
hold that only the Lineman is responsible for all what had 
happened as pressed time and again by the learned counsel. It 
must not be lost sight of that Lineman figures in after receiving 
the advice slip and he has nothing t o do with the technical SMC 18/2010 etc.  40
aspects of the said installation. The feasibility report could not 
have been prepared without having examined the premises, 
physical inspection and other technical aspects concerning 
installation of new telephones. The feasibility r eport was found 
signed by Muhammad Amim, SDO and Karamat Hussain, 
Engineering Supervisor but the new installations were not 
installed in the premises where it should have been done. This 
was also in contrav ention of the advice slip which  resulted into a 
huge loss worth whereof runs into millions as the fake 
subscribers could not be traced out subsequently by whom such 
telephones were used but payment of the bills was never made.”  
 
2. Abdul Khaliq v. The State  (2006 SCMR 1886)  
“5. ...The common intention contem plated [section 34]  is 
anterior in time to the commission of the crime, and does not 
refer to the time when the act is committed. The Privy Council 
has held that it must be shown that the criminal act complained 
against was done by one of the accused perso ns in furtherance 
of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for 
the crime may be imposed on anyone of the persons in the same 
manner as if the act were done by him alone. `Common 
intention' within the meaning of the section implies a  pre-
arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying 
the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in 
concert pursuant to the pre -arranged plan. It is difficult if not 
impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the int ention of an 
individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or 
conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case. Same or 
similar intention must not be confused with common intention; 
the partition which divides "their bounds" is often very  thin; 
nevertheless, the distinction is real and substantial, and if 
overlooked, will result in miscarriage of justice. The inference of 
common intention should never be reached unless it is a 
necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the 
case. Common intention does not mean similar intention of 
several persons. To constitute common intention it is necessary SMC 18/2010 etc.  41
that the intention of each one of them be known to the rest of 
them and shared by them. .. 
 
6. After having gone through almost entire law  qua the 
provisions as contained in section 34, in our considered view the 
following are the prerequisites of the section 34 before it could 
be made applicable:  
(a) It must be proved that criminal act was done by various 
persons.  
(b) The completion of crim inal act must be in furtherance of 
common intention as  they all intended to do so. '             
(c) There must be a pre -arranged plan and criminal act should 
have been done in  concert pursuance whereof.  
(d) Existence of strong circumstances (for which no y ardstick 
can be fixed    and    each case will have to be discussed on its 
own merits) to show common intention.  
(e) The real and substantial distinction in between `common 
intention' and `similar intention' be kept in view.”  
 
3. Muhammad Irshad v. Muhammad Ba shir Goraya  (2006 SCMR 
1292)  
“18. It may be noted that th ere is distinction between the 
‘abetment’ and ‘conspiracy’. As far as ‘abetment’  is concerned, it 
is punishable as provided for the original offence, charged 
against the principal accused, falling wi thin the mischief of 
section 1 09, P.P.C.; whereas ‘conspiracy’  itself is an offence and 
person can be sep arately charged with regard to ‘conspiracy’ . In 
this behalf in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Kandimalla Subbaiah  
(AIR 1961 SC 1241 ) it has been held that "there may be an 
element of abetment in conspiracy; it is something m ore than an 
abetment". Whereas ‘ criminal conspi racy’ has been defined in 
Halsbury Laws 4th Edition, Vol.11, para.58, page 44 as 
`conspiracy consists in the agreement of two or more person s to 
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. It is 
an indictable offence at common law, the punishment of which is 
imprisonment or fine or both in the discretion of the Court".  SMC 18/2010 etc.  42
 
4. In re corruption in Rental Power Plants  (2012 SCMR 773):  
“81. ...all the Government functionaries, including the Ministers 
for Water and Power holding charge from 2006 and onward up to 
2008 during whose tenure the RPPs were approved/set up, 
prima facie, violated the principle of transparency, therefore, 
their i nvolvement in getting financial benefits out of the same by 
indulging in corruption and corrupt practices cannot be overruled 
in view of the discussion made hereinabove. Consequently, they 
are liable to be dealt with under the National Accountability 
Ordin ance, 1999 by the NAB.”  
 
5. Jawed Iqbal Bokhari v. NAB  (PLD 2003 Lahore 669)  
“27. In his capacity as a senior civil servant and later as the 
Incharge of the Cooperative Societies, during the crucial period, 
he could exact obedience and in return he allowed ma lpractice to 
take place with impunity, and we have seen the destruction of 
the Cooperative movement in this part of the world because of 
the complicity of the corrupt private sector and the corrupt 
official sector and which resulted in the bankrupting of t he 
Societies after the general loot. People are to this day crying for 
refund of their dues. .. 
34. In a White Collar Crime, there is planning for a considerable 
time where people are cultivated and are bribed indirectly and 
often obliquely so that they wou ld be of use at a time when they 
were needed.  
41. NAB Ordinance has an overriding effect over other laws as 
we see section 3 of the Ordinance. This is a special law which 
came into being for purposes reflected in the preamble. As it had 
an overriding effec t, all cases involving abuse of power and 
default in payment of outstanding amounts due to financial 
institution were brought within its ambit for proceeding in a 
criminal Court. ” 
 
6. Ashfaq Baig v. The State  (PLD 2004 Karachi 353)  SMC 18/2010 etc.  43
“24. A perusal of [section 9(vi), NAB Ordinance] shows that 
following are the ingredients, constituting offence under this 
provision: - 
(a)        A holder of a public office, or any other person misuses 
the authority;  
(b)        so as to gain any benefit or favour for himself or any  
other person;   
(c)        renders or attempts to render or willfully fails to 
exercise his authority;   
(d)        to prevent the grant of rendition of any undue benefit or 
favour which he could have prevented by exercising his 
authority.  
The language of t he provision is very clear and free from any 
ambiguity. The first ingredient is the misuse of authority. 
However, it is not unqualified which is indicated from the use of 
expressions immediately following, "so as to gain any benefit or 
favour for himself o r any other person". Thus, the misuse of 
authority simpliciter, may entail to a disciplinary action under the 
respective efficiency and disciplinary rules by way of an 
administrative/executive action but shall not constitute an 
offence under Section 9(a)(v i) of the NAB Ordinance, until unless 
the misuse of authority is with intention/purpose to gain any 
benefit or favour for himself or any other person or is directed in 
this behalf. Here we will hasten to add that it is not necessary 
that the misuse of auth ority should necessarily result into gain, 
benefit or favour for the person exercising the authority or any 
other person but it would amount to an offence even, if the 
misuse of authority is rendered or there is an attempt to render 
towards the gain, benef it or favour. This intention is manifested 
with the use of words "render or attempt to render". Now we 
come to the second part of the subsection which provides that if 
any person wilfully fails to exercise its authority to prevent the 
grant or rendition of  any undue benefit or favour, which he could 
have prevented by exercising his authority, it would amount to 
commit corruption and corrupt practices. It means that in the 
second part also mere inaction or failure to exercise the SMC 18/2010 etc.  44
authority in deviation or ev en violation of any administrative 
policy decision instructions, rules or regulations, per se, would 
not be a criminal offence under this provision but shall become 
so if the failure or inaction on the part of any person results into 
rendition of any undue  benefit or favour which that person could 
have prevented by exercising his authority or any grant could 
have been prevented but was not so prevented for want of 
action on the part of the person concerned and on account of 
omission of exercise of authority . There are two parts of the 
provision contained in Section 9(a)(vi) of the NAB Ordinance. 
First, resulting from an action on the part of holder of public 
office or any other person and, second, on account of omission 
on the part of such person, the sine q ua non, is that such action 
is with the intention/purpose and in direction towards any gain, 
benefit or favour for such person or any other person and 
rendering of misuse of authority or an attempt to render the 
misuse of authority is necessarily towards t he gain, benefit or 
favour for the person exercising authority or any other person. 
Likewise the omission, failures or inaction in exercise of the 
authority should such that in the event of exercise of authority, 
the grant or rendition of any undue benefit  or favour could have 
been prevented. Thus, the intention of Legislature is very clear 
that in order to constitute an offence under Section 9(a)(vi) of 
the NAB Ordinance, the necessary ingredient is the intention or 
purpose to gain any benefit or favour fo r such person or any 
other person and the inaction/omission is also in the same 
direction.  
 
7. Muhammad Farooq Maan v. Director -General, Anti -Corruption  
(2010 PCr.LJ 997)  
“14. ...it is pertinent to say that said petitioner was also 
member of the Committee as Deputy Secretary (Properties) and 
as such, he should not have been a silent spectator, rather he 
being the person dealing with property affairs, prima facie was 
the person pointing out the properties subject -matter of these 
F.I.Rs. When apparent illegaliti es were being committed, he SMC 18/2010 etc.  45
should have recorded his separate objections, if at all he was not 
party to the deeds of other members. His silence alone is 
sufficient to hold that he had shared the common intention and 
thus he cannot be singled out at this st age.”  
 
The principles applied in the aforementioned cases were also applied 
by the Supreme Court of India in inter alia Central Bureau of 
Investigation v. V. C. Shukla  (AIR 1998 Supreme Court 1406) and 
Krishna Govind Patil v. State of Maharashtra  (AIR 197 3 Supreme Court 
1388). Therefore, it is abundantly clear that public servants who have 
a duty to ensure transparency yet they abet the commission of 
corruption by allowing acts which it is their duty to stop should be 
proceeded against under section 9(a)(v i) of the NAB Ordinance, 1999.  
54.  It is also pertinent to deal with the violations of the PPRA 
Rules that are evident from the above discussion. It is now well -
documented how this Court has been ensuring the enforcement of the 
PPRA Rules. The PPRA Rules  have put the developed common law of 
public procurement on a statutory footing to ensure that State 
largesse is dispensed keeping in view the cardinal principle of avoiding 
excessive and wanton expenditure of public money. A violation of 
these rules is a clear indication of corruption. From the above 
discussion and the documents placed on record, it is patently clear 
that open competitive bidding did not take place nor was the lowest 
bid accepted by NICL in the transactions highlighted in this case.  
55.   In the circumstances explained above, it is established that 
the order dated  24.01.2011 in pursuance  whereof  notification was 
issued on  18.04.2011  allowing  Zafar Ahmed Qureshi to discharge his 
function s as Additional D.G. FIA for completing investigation o f cases  SMC 18/2010 etc.  46
registered at Lahore . There can  be no two opinions that corruption and 
corrupt practices were being committed from  day one i.e. when 
summary was sent for the appointment of Ayyaz Khan Niazi, which 
result ed in all the criminal deeds, ac tions, omissi ons and commissions. 
Had Ministry of Commerce adhere d to Civil Servants (Appointment, 
Promotion and Transfers) Rules, 197 3 i.e. if at all Ayyaz Khan  Niazi 
had to  be appoint ed instead of two other Government officers of BPS -
21, namely , Muhammad Anisul Hussa in and Mr. Naveed Arif through 
publication and SECP had conduct ed fit and proper test under section 
12 of the National Insurance Ordinance, 2000 , there were all 
possibilities to avoid corruption and corrupt practices and 
misappropriation of billions belong ing to public exchequer . 
56.  It would not be out of place to mention here that 
corruption is a particularly iniquitous malady that has plagued Pakistan 
even before its inception. We as a nation have utterly failed to adhere 
to the counsels of our incorrup tible Quaid -e-Azam Muhammad Ali 
Jinnah, who in 1945 wrote a letter to Mirza Abol Hassan Ispahani 
wherein he stated, “ Corruption is a curse in India and amongst 
Muslims, especially the so -called educated and intelligentsia. 
Unfortunately, it is this class t hat is selfish and morally and 
intellectually corrupt. No doubt this disease is common, but amongst 
this particular class of Muslims it is rampant.”  This elite class of 
Muslims continued to survive and thrive in the newly created State of 
Pakistan. This el ite class has seen fit to devour the meagre resources 
of our poverty -stricken country to meet their own ends; to live in 
callous decadence while the vast majority of the population remains in 
a condition of indigence and squalor. There cannot be a more fla grant SMC 18/2010 etc.  47
example of exploitation; a  violation of Article 3 of the Constitution, 
which reads, “The State shall ensure the elimination of all forms of 
exploitation and the gradual fulfilment of the fundamental principle, 
from each according to his ability to ea ch according to his work.” 
Indeed, the renowned British philosopher Edmund Burke was correct 
when he stated, “Among a people generally corrupt, liberty cannot 
long exist.”  
57.  It is particularly pertinent to note how Quaid -e-Azam 
referred to corruption a s a disease. Corruption has been referred to in 
the sense of a physiological sickness ever since the time of Plato, who 
in his magnum opus  “The Republic ” referred to corruption as a disease 
that may strike a person or a city -state in a metaphorical sense. The 
Greek historian Plutarch also equated corruption with physical 
sickness, stating that moral and political corruption struck ancient 
Sparta like a disease. ( The Life of Agis ) We recently dilated upon how 
corruption is akin to disease in Suo Moto Case No . 15 of 2010 
(Corruption in Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation ) (PLD 2012 Supreme 
Court 610) wherein we referred to the decision of the Supreme Court 
of India in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ram Singh  (AIR 2000 Supreme 
Court 870)  which also characterised corru ption as a plague, 
“Corruption in a civilized society is a disease like cancer, which if not 
detected in time is sure to malign the polity of country leading to 
disastrous consequences. It is termed as plague which is not only 
contagious but if not control led spreads like a fire in a jungle. Its virus 
is compared with HIV leading to AIDS being incurable. It has also been 
termed as Royal thievery. The socio -political system exposed to such a 
dreaded communicable disease is likely to crumble under its own SMC 18/2010 etc.  48
weight. Corruption is opposed to democracy and social order, being 
not only anti people, but aimed and targeted against them. It affects 
the economy and destroys the cultural heritage unless nipped in the 
bud at the earliest.”  
58.  Transparency International (TI) conducts a ranking of the 
countries with the most and least corrupt administrations, called the 
Corruption Perception Index. According to TI, “ The CPI scores and 
ranks countries/territories based on how corrupt a country’s public 
sector is perceived t o be. It is a composite index, a combination of 
surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of 
reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of 
corruption worldwide. Corruption generally comprises illegal activities, 
which are deliberately hidden and only come to light through scandals, 
investigations or prosecutions. ” The lower the ranking, the more 
corrupt the country’s administration is. Pakistan’s ranking over the 
years is given in the following table:  
Year  Ranking  
2012 139 
2011 134

2004 129 
2003 92 
2002 77 
2001 79 
  SMC 18/2010 etc.  49
The aforementioned rank ings of TI paint a bleak and dismal  picture. 
Corruption in Pakistan is akin to a cancer which is metastasising; 
growing larger year by year at an alarming rate. The roots of 
corruption are only ingratiating themselves deeper and deeper  in this 
country ’s moral fabric as the days pass. We as a nation, however, are 
content to be enslaved to this Hydra , with no Heracles in sight. In this 
regard, the Bible states, “They promise them freedom, but they 
themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a 
person, to that he is enslaved.” (Bible, 2 Peter 2:19) Governments 
come and go, but corruption is the one constan t that not only remains 
but increases in magnitude. The majority of our population call 
themselves Muslims and proudly claim to be denizens of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan. Some  even go as far to claim that Pakistan is the 
“citadel of Islam”, but we fa il to follow the most basic of the religion’s  
moral tenets. Allah has commanded in the Holy Quran, “And eat not 
up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to gain 
the hearing of judges [and rulers] that ye may knowingly devour a 
portion of  the property of others.” (Al -Quran, Surah al -Baqarah, Verse 
188, translated by Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall)  
59.   The above discussion persuades us to hold as under : - 
(a) That appointment of Ayyaz Khan Niazi was contrary to 
section 12 of the Insurance O rdinance , 2000 a nd rules 
framed thereunder, as non-transparent, illegal and 
unwarranted.  Thus, except one of the officers (Tariq Zubair 
Khan, Section Officer), all others i.e. Qamar Zaman 
Chaudhry, the then Additional Secretary;  Suleman Ghani 
the then Secretary Commerce; Makhdoom Amin Fahim, 
the then Commerce Minister;  Ismail Qureshi,  the then  SMC 18/2010 etc.  50
Secretary Establishment; and Ms. Nargis Sethi, the then  
Acting Principal Secretary to Prime Minister  are involved in 
his appointment and, prima facie, are liable to be dealt 
with under section 9(a)(vi) of the National Accountability 
Ordinance, 1999 [ as amended by National A ccountability 
Bureau (Amendment) Ordinance , 2002 ] on account of 
NICL scam pertaining to Punjab  (Lahore) and Sindh 
(Karachi) where allegedly offenc es of corruption and 
corrup t practices have been committed;  
(b) The notification dated 18.04.2012 transferring Zafar 
Ahmed Qureshi, Director FIA , prima facie , also involve s 
Malik Muhammad Iqbal, former DG, FIA ; Qamar Zaman 
Chaudhry, Abdul Rauf Chaudhry and  Khushood Akhtar 
Lashari (former DG, FIA, Secretary Interior, Secretary 
Establishment and Principal Secretary to Prime Minister 
respectively) as well as Waqar Haider, the then Director 
FIA, Lahore , as they created hurdles and hampered the 
smooth  and transp arent investigation entrusted to Mr. 
Zafar Ahmed Qureshi in NICL scam , pertaining to Lahore . 
Thus, prima facie , they are also required to be dealt with 
under section 9(a)(vi) of NAO , 1999 as they wrongly 
exercised their authority to benefit Ayyaz Khan Niaz i and 
others from public money, which has been looted through  
non-transparent transaction from NICL ; 
(c) On account of transfer of Zafar Ahmed Qureshi an amount 
of Rs.420 million due against Mohsin Habib Warraich and 
others could not be recovered. Likewise , another huge 
amount has been deposited by the accused person s in 
bank account of Moonis Elahi with EFG Private Bank Ltd.,  
London  having a balance of £1.138 million, in the name 
of a company owned by him and another account in the 
name of Beenish Khan (wi fe of Mohsin Habib Warraich) 
in Ba rclays Bank London with a balance of £0. 102 
million , had not been recovered;  SMC 18/2010 etc.  51
(d) FIA after transfer of Zafar Ahmed Qureshi failed to 
retrieve the outstanding amount s which were frozen, but 
were illegally activated without following the procedure, 
during the period he remained disassociated from the 
investigation of the case w.e.f. 19.04.2011 to 13.08.2011 . 
Therefore, Chairman NAB is directed to have all these 
cases transferred on his file and proceed in accordance 
with law , take necessary steps to effect recovery of 
outstanding amount noted above and also  effect the arrest 
of Mohsin Habib Warraich, Amin Qasim Dada, Khalid 
Anwar, etc. , as early as possible;  
(e) M/s Qamar Zaman Chaudhry and Abdul Rauf Chaudhry 
have been found liable for contempt  of Court vide order 
16.06.2012.  The plea put forward in reply to show -cause 
notices under section 17(1) of the Contempt of Court 
Ordinance, 200 3 read with Article 204 of the Constitution, 
are hereby turned down and proceedings are postp oned to 
frame charge against them,  for a date to be fixed by the 
office ; 
(f) Khushnood Akhtar Lashari, though filed reply of show 
cause notice for contempt of Court but had not appeared in 
Court, therefore, proceedings against him be kept pending  
and proce ss be repeated agai nst him to appear in the 
Court;  
 
60.  The Suo Motu Case 18 of 2010 stands disposed of along 
with miscellaneous applications, whereas, Criminal Original Petition 
No.50 of 2011 against Qamar Zaman  Chaudhry , Abdul Rauf  Chaudhry  
and Khushnoo d Akhtar Lashari is adjourned .    
61.  The cases of contempt of Court against Senator A. Rehman 
Malik and others are delinked and ordered to be fixed along  with the SMC 18/2010 etc.  52
cases of all other contemnors  noted hereinabove , including contempt 
of Court against Malik Muhammad Iqbal, Ex. DG, FIA as in his case 
judgment was reserved but now one of the Hon’ble member of the 
Bench has  retired, therefore, his case is also to be heard afresh .
