ORDER  
 Pursuant to the order dated 3 April 2024 the five High Courts have 
submitted their respective proposals which were read out by the learned 
Attorney -General for Pakistan (‘ AG’). Proposals were also sought from the 
Pakistan Bar Council (‘ PBC’) and the Supreme Court Bar Association 
(‘SCBA ’). PBC has submitted its proposals and the Vice President and 
Additional Secretary of SCBA state that since a meeting of the SCBA had 
not taken place they will be submitting their proposals before the next date 
of hearing.  
 
2. Few petitions and a number of applications have been filed by other 
bar councils and bar ass ociations seeking to be joined as parties to these 
proceedings. Others too have filed similar applications. However, we will 
only entertain the same to the extent of considering proposals made 
therein.  
 
3. It would be appropriate and helpful if bar council s and bar 
associations come together and preferably file one document containing 
their proposals. However, if agreement cannot be reached amongst them 
they may file separate proposals.  
 
4. If any bar council or association wants to obtain copies of the 
proposals submitted by the High Courts they may obtain the same from the 
office.  
 
5. The learned AG may also submit proposals on behalf of the 
Federation. With regard to the allegations levelled in the letter of the six 
Hon’ble Judges of the Islamabad High Co urt against the Federation, or any 
agency under the Federal Government, responses thereto be submitted 
through the learned AG before the next date of hearing.  
 
6. To come up on Tuesday, 7 May 2024 at 11.30 am.

The Federal Government has to submit its 
response to the grave status of interference by 
the executive as highlighted by all the High 
Courts. This is the most serious and grave 
undermining of the independence of ju diciary 
which cannot be trivialised.  The Federal 
Government controls the Intelligence Agencies 
and it is for it to explain its position before this 
Court. The buck stops with the Federal 
Government. The High Courts have indicated 
that the phenomenon has ex isted till recently.
