JUDGMENT  
 
 SMC. No. 7/2017  2
Qazi Faez Isa, J.   
Background  
1.  Muslim candidates contesting elections have to submit a 
declaration in a prescribed written form affirming  that Prophet 
Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the last prophet  
sent by Almighty Allah . This declaration used to state , “I solemnly 
swear… ” but the words were substituted , in the Elections Act, 
2017 with, “I believe …”1. Due to  the change in the wording of the 
declaration  there were widespread protests. The Government  
decided to undo the change  made  to the wording of the declaration 
and revert the law to its original position.   
 
2. The Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs on 5th 
October, 2017  introduced  a bill  to revert  to the original text of the 
said declaration . The “Statement of Objects and Reasons ” of th e 
Bill2 is reproduced hereunder:  
Subsequent to the enactment of the Election s Act, 2017 
(XXXIII of 2017), misgiving s have been expressed in the 
National Assembly and also reported in the media 
regarding the wording of the “DECLARATIONS BY THE 
CANDIDATE” in the nomination form (FORM A) attached 
with the Act.  
 
2. In order to avoid further controversy, there is 
consensus a mongst the political parties in the National 
Assembly that the original text of “DECLARATION AND 
OATH BY THE PERSON NOMINATED”, included in 
original Form -IA, should be restored in toto.  
 
3. Misgiving s have also been expressed regarding the 
omission of Articles 7B and 7C consequent upon the 
repeal of the Conduct of General Elections Order, 2002 
(Chief Executive’s Order No. 7 of 2002). Again to avoid 
further controversy, there is consensus amongst the 
political parties that the provisions of Article 7B and 7C 
ibid be retained through amendment in section 241 of the 
Election s Act, 2017. Hence this Bill.

 Parliament accepted the aforesaid amendment and the 
Elections (Amendment) Act, 20173 was enacted on 1 9th October, 
2017 and the words “ solemnly swear ” found their way back into 
the law.  The rel evant part of the declaration  as it stands since 19th 
October, 2017  is reproduced here under:  
 I, the above mentioned candidate, solemnly swear that:  
 
(i) I believe i n the absolute and unqualified finality of 
the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon 
him), the last of the prophets and that I am not the 
follower of any one who claims to be a Prophet in 
any sense of the word or of any description 
whatsoever after Prophe t Muhammad (peace be 
upon him), and that I do not recognize such a 
claimant to be Prop het or a religious reformer, nor  
do I belong to the Qadiani group or the Lahori 
group or call myself an Ahmadi.  
 
(ii) I will be faithful to the declaration made by the 
Founder of Pakistan Quaid -e-Azam Muhammad Ali 
Jinnah, that Pakistan would be a democratic state 
based on Islamic principles of social justice. I will 
bear true faith and allegiance to Pakistan and 
uphold the sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan 
and that I w ill strive to preserve the Islamic 
Ideology which is the basis for the creation of 
Pakistan.   
 
 
TLP’s Dharna  
3. Parliament had resolved t he misgiving s with regard to the 
language of the declaration (on 19th October, 2017 ), however,  the 
Tehreek -e-Labaik Pakistan (“ TLP”), a recently formed political 
party , continued to protest. On 5th November, 2017  the member s 
of TLP and its supporters occupied a road junction (interchange) 
known as the ‘Faizabad Interchange’, which is one of the main 
entry-exit points to  Pakistan’s C apital, Islamabad , and its fourth 
largest city, Rawalpindi. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles 
traverse Faizabad Interchange daily. TLP demanded the removal of 
the Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and, then, 
called for the re signation of the government itself. The sit -in, 
colloquially referred to as dharna , at the Faizabad Interchange 
                                       
3 Act No. XXXV of 2017, The Gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary, Part I, 19th 
October, 2017.  SMC. No. 7/2017  4
effectively paralyzed the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The 
working of the courts, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
was disrupted.  Many litigants and their counsel could not attend 
to their cases. The threats and abuse continued unabated and  the 
situation exacerbated. On 21st November, 2017 a number of 
counsel could  not attend  Court  because of the dharna . The Deputy 
Attorney General for Pakistan complained that he reached the 
Supreme Court with great difficulty , and only managed to do  so by 
using an alternative route , which took three hours longer than his 
usual travelling time. The public ’s movement was restricted or 
altogether stopp ed. They could not commute, could not get  to 
courts, schools, colleges, universities, their place of work, et cetera . 
Those needing medical treatment could  not reach doctors or 
hospitals . Ambulances  transport ing the seriously ill  could not get 
to Emergenc y.  
 
4. The leaders of the dharna  intimidated, hurled threats , 
abused , provoked and promoted hatred. The media provided 
unabated coverage  to TLP. Anyone having a grouse against the 
government joined in. The report4 submitted by Inter Services 
Intelligence (“ISI”) under the title “Public Support” and subtitle 
“Political Parties/Personalities” listed the following: “1) Sheikh 
Rasheed Ahmed (Chairman AML), 2) Ejaz-ul-Haq (PML -Z), 3) PTI 
Ulema Wing Islamabad released audio message  and 4) Sheikh 
Hameed ( PPP)”. Inflammatory speeches were delivered  by 
irresponsible politician s. Some unscrupulous  talk-show hosts 
incited and provoked  citizens . The free publicity  made TLP , a little 
known political party , into a pheno menon. Basking in the 
                                       
4 C. M. A. No. 1229/2018.  SMC. No. 7/2017  5
limelight, TLP’s leadership became ever more intransigent, abusive 
and aggressive . With each  passing day, as they grew in strength 
and number they became  delusional  and alleged that people  would 
be rendered objects of Divine displeasure  (which is a criminal 
offence5) unless they follow ed the chosen path of the TLP.  Protests 
turned  violent and spread to other cities.  
 
5. It was in abovementioned  background that  on 21st 
November, 2017, this Court passed an order , the relevant part 
whereof is reproduced hereunder :  
4.  The prevailing situation demonstrates that the 
matter is one of public interest and a number of 
Fundamental Rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, including, right to life 
(Article  9), freedom of movement (Art icle 15), right to 
education (Article 25A) are prima facie being infringed, which 
enables this Court to take notice under Article 184  (3) of the 
Constitution…  
 
6.  We would therefore issue notices to the Attorney 
General for Pakistan, Secretary Interior, S ecretary Defence 
and Advocate General Punjab. The Learned Attorney General 
for Pakistan is also directed to file comments of the Ministry 
of Interior and Defence, the intelligence agencies under their 
respective ministries, including the Intelligence Burea u (IB) 
and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and to submit what, if 
any, measures have been taken to ensure that the 
Constitutional rights of citizens of Pakistan are protected and 
enforced in accordance with law.  
 
Article 184 (3) of the Constitution  and Supreme Court’s 
Jurisdiction  
 
6. This Court had invoked  jurisdiction under Article 184 (3)  of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  (“the 
Constitution ”), which provision is reproduced hereunder : 
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 199, the 
Supreme Court shall, if it considers that a question of 
public importance with reference to the enforcement of 
any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of 
Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of the 
nature  mentioned in the said Article.  
 
                                       
5 Section 508 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 makes it a punishable offence to 
induce a person to believe that he will be rendered an obje ct of Divine 
Displeasure, and illustration (a) thereunder is with regard to a person who “sits 
dhurna ”. SMC. No. 7/2017  6
Chapter 1 of Part II  referred  to in Article 184 (3)  of the 
Constitution  is titled “ Fundamental Rights ” and Articles  9 through 
to 28 of the Constitution  set out specific fundamental rights . These 
fundamental r ights are categorized as human rights in many 
countries and in international treaties .  
 
7. The jurisdiction invoked by this Court  was neither 
questioned nor challenged . However, as the original jurisdiction of 
this Court  was invoked we should e nsure that  it was done in  
accordance with the Constitution . Part VII of the Constitution is 
titled “ The Judicature ” and is divided into different chapters:  
Chapter 1  – The Court, Chapter 2 – The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, Chapter 3  – The High Courts and Chapter 3A – Federal 
Shariat Courts. The Constitution stipulates  that, “ No court shall 
have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the 
Constitution or by or under any law ”6. The Constitution  confers a  
number of different jurisdictions  on the Supreme  Court. The most 
commonly used  one is this Court’s  appellate jurisdiction7 
whereunder  appeals and petitions for leave to appeal are heard ; 
these  arise from cases already decided by a High  Court or 
tribunal8. Under  its transfer  jurisdiction this Court may, “transfer 
any case, appeal or other proceedings pending before any High 
Court to any other High Court ”.9 The advisory jurisdiction  of this 
Court may be  availed  of by the President to seek the opinion  of this 
Court , “on any question of law which he considers of public 
                                       
6 Article 175 ( 2) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  
7 Article 185 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  
8 Article 185 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  
9 Article 186A inserted by the Revival of the Constitution of 1973 Order 
(Presidential Order No. 14 of 1973) affirmed by the Constitution (Eighth 
Amendment Act, 1985 and incorporated as Ar ticle 270A in the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  SMC. No. 7/2017  7
importance ”10. The Supreme Court is also empowered to decide, 
“Any dispute between any two or more Governments ”11. In the 
exercise of its review jurisdiction this Court has the power to 
review its own  judgme nts and orders12. The Supreme Court also 
has an ancillary  power , “for doing complete justice in any case or 
matter pending before it” 13.  
 
8. Jurisdiction under  Article 184 (3 ) may be invoked  by th e 
Supreme Court  if two preconditions are met. Firstly, the matter 
must be one of public importance  and, secondly, it must  pertain to 
the enforcement of any of the F undamental Rights. The term public 
importance however is not defined in the Constitution. We may 
therefore, in accordance with settled principles of interpretation, 
consider whether the same phrase – public importance – is used 
elsewhere in the Constitution, and if so, by reference thereto  the 
scope of these words can be bette r determine d. Every citizen has 
the fundamental right to access “ information in all matters of 
public importance ”14. The President may “ obtain the opinion of the 
Supreme Court on any question of law which he consider s of public 
importance ”15. Appeals from a judgment, decree, order or 
sentence of an Administrative Court or Tribunal lies to the 
Supreme Court if it, “ involves a substantial question of law of 
public importance ”16. These provisions like Article 184 (3) of the 
Constitution use the word  “public ” in conjunction with the word  
“importance ” meaning  thereby  that the mere importance of  a

matter isn’t, in itself , sufficient  to invoke jurisdiction . The matter 
must be one of public importance , that is,  it must involve the rights 
of the public  too.  
 
9. In the case of Benazir Bhutto v Federation of Pakistan17 this 
Court held that, “ It is only when the element of “public importance” 
is involved that the Supreme Court can exercise its power to issue 
the writ ”18. In the case of Manzoor Elahi v Federatio n of Pakistan19, 
this Court had deliberated on what is meant by public  importance :  
Now, what is meant by a question of public importance. 
The term “public” is invariably employed  in 
contradistinction to the terms private or individual , and 
connotes, as an adjective , something pe rtaining to, or 
belonging to, the people; relating to a nation, state, or 
community . In other words, it refers to something which is 
to be shared or participated  in or enjoyed by the public at 
large, and is not limited or restricted to any particular  
class of the community. As observed by the Judicial 
Committee of the Privy Council in Hamabai  Franjee Petit v. 
Secretary of State for India -in-Council  ILR 39 Bomb. 279, 
while construing the words public purpose  such a phrase 
“whatever else it may mean must include a pu rpose, that 
is an object or aim, in which the general interest of the 
community, as opposed to the particular interest of 
individuals, is directly and vitally concerned”.  This 
definition appears to me to be equally applica ble to the 
phrase “public importance” .  
 
The aforesaid definition  of public importance , has been 
consistently followed by this Court. In Suo Moto Case No. 1320 the 
definition as had been enunciated in the cases  Manzoor Elah i and 
Benazir Bhutto  (above ) was reiterated :  
The public importance of case is determined as observed 
by this Court in Manzoor Elahi ’s case (supra ) on question 
affecting the legal rights and liberties of the people at 
large, even though the individual  who may have brought 
the matter before the Court is of no significance. Similarly, 
it was observed in Benazir Bhutto’s  case (supra ), that 
public importance should be viewed with reference  to 
freedom and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, 
their protection and invasion of these rights in a manner, 
which raises a serious question regarding their 
enforcement, irrespective of the fact whether such 
infraction of right, freedom or liberty is alleged by an 
individual or a group of in dividuals .

v Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1988 SC 161, 2092).  
19 Manzoor Elahi v Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1975 SC 66, 144 -145).  
20 Suo Motu Case No. 13 of 2007  (PLD 2009 SC 217, 229).  SMC. No. 7/2017  9
 
 In Sohail Butt v Deputy Inspector General of Police21 this 
Court  observed :  
Public importance must include a purpose or aim in which 
general interest of the community  as opposed to the 
particular interest of the individuals is directly and vitally 
concerned.  
 
 In Watan Party v Federation of Pakistan22 this Court  said 
that the scope of public importance had been settled , and it related 
to the general interest of the community :  
It is settled that public importance  must include a 
purpose or aim in which the general interest of the 
community as opposed to the particular interest of the 
individuals is  directly and vitally concerned.  
 
Thus, a fortiori,  this Court may  invoke its  power under 
Article 184 (3)  of the Consti tution provided  the matter is one  of 
public  importance  and pertains to the enforcement of  any of the  
Fundamental R ights .  
 
10. To ensure that in matters of public importance the  citizens 
are not deprived of their  fundamental rights  is the underlying  
objective of Article 184 (3) of the Constitution . Before an order is 
made under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution it would be 
appropriate if this Court identifies the public importance  of the 
matter  and the fundamental right/s requiring enforcement. And  
every possible care should be taken before making an order  under 
Article 184 (3) since there is no right to  appeal such an order .  
 
Applicability of Article 184 ( 3) of the Constitution to this C ase

pelted stones, damaged and burnt vehicles and properties .

providing emergency services , including  those  of firefighters , Bomb 
Disposa l and  Rescue  were prevented from rendering emergency 
assistance  or would get  unreasonably delayed  searching for 
alternative  routes to the emergency . Deprived of access to doctors 
and medical facilities  countless people suffered . An eight -year-old 
boy lost his life because the dharna on the Faizabad Interchan ge 
prevented the ambulance , in which he was being taken , to reach 
the hospital23. There may have been many  more  such similar  cases 
which were not reported .  
 
12. Preventing  the sick from reaching doctors and hospitals 
infringes their right to life (guaranteed under Article 9 of the 
Constitution ) which  requires  enforce ment . Blocking  roads for  long 
duration s prevents  citizens from exercising  their right to  freedom  of 
movement  (guaranteed by Article 1 5 of the Constitution) and this 
right of theirs  requires  enforce ment . When students cannot  attend  
schools and educational institutions  their right to education 
(guaranteed under Article 25A of the Constitution)  requires  
enforcement . When  litigants ’ access to courts is blocked  their right 
to fair trial a nd due process ( guaranteed by Article 10A of the 
Constitution ) requires  enforcement . Abusing , threatening  and 
attacking people undermines their right to live  a life of  “dignity ” 
(guaranteed under Article 14 (1) of the Constitution ) which requires  
enforcement . When shops and businesses are forced to shut, when 
people cannot pursue their vocation, when poor daily workers are 
denied the possibility of earning a livelihood  their right to work  
(guaranteed by Article 18  of the Constitution ) requires

enforcement . When property is damaged or destroyed the right to 
hold and enjoy property ( guaranteed under Article 23 of the 
Constitution ) requires  enforcement .  
 
13. Rawalpindi  and Islamabad  were brought to a grinding halt . 
Protests spread to other cities . The country effectively came under 
lockdown. The matter  undisputedly  was one of public importance  
and required  the enforcement of the fundamental r ights of nearly 
every citizen . This Court therefore invoked  its jurisdiction under 
Article 184 (3) of the Co nstitution . 
 
Reports and Proceedings  
14. On 23rd November, 2017 the learned Attorney General for 
Pakistan (“ AGP”) submitted in Court the Intelligence Bureau (“ IB”) 
report24 which stated that, “To keep the participants of sit -in 
engaged and charged, the TLP leadership resorted to delivering 
provocative speeches ”. The report further stated  that, “ TLP is 
determined to exploit the situation and gain political mileage to gain 
support for next general elections”. As per t he IB  report  the, “normal 
life of the ordin ary citizens of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, especially 
those visiting twin cities on daily basis for routine purposes stand 
paralyzed ”. The report25 submitted by  the Ministry of Interior 
confirmed the content s of the  IB report . It also disclosed that the  
requisite permission to take out a rally or to stage a sit -in (dharna ) 
was not obtained by the TLP and that TLP’s  leadership repeatedly  
broke their promise to relocate to the designa ted protest areas , 
namely , the Democracy Park and the Speech Corner. The report26

of the Inspector General of Police, Islamabad (“ IGP Islamabad ”) 
correspond s with the reports of IB and the Min istry of Interior and 
highlighted  the illegal actions of the protestors, including causing 
the death of a seriousl y ill eight -year-old child. The ISI report27 did 
not negate  the reports  submitted by  IB, Ministry of interior and 
IGP Islamabad . 
 
15. On 25th November, 2017 the law enforcement  personnel  
used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protestors , but 
failed , and gave up after a hundred and seventy -three  of them  
suffered serious injur y. The law enforcement personnel were  not 
allowed to use firearms and were provided only with anti -riot 
equipment28. “The mob/protestors were so prepared that they even 
cut the wi res of all relevant cameras installed within the jurisdiction 
of Islamabad and Rawalpindi…  The level of preparedness of the 
protestors can be well imagin ed from the fact that they  cut the 
cables of CCTV cameras installed around the sit -in places through 
which their activities were monitored. ”29 The Government then 
invoked Article 245 of the Constitution and sought the assistance 
of the Army . But, before  the Army was deployed the matter was 
resolved  between the Government and the protestors  on the night 
of 26th November, 201730, and TLP and its supporters, who 
received payment from men in uniform31, dispersed .  
 
16. We had sought  additional information from PEMRA , the 
Ministry of Defence and the ISI  on 19th March, 2018 and on 24th

April, 2018 . Inexplicably, t he case was not fixed again for over five 
months . On  11th October, 2018, we directed the Election 
Commission of Pakistan (“ the Election Commission ”) to submit a 
report  regarding the registration of TLP as a political party  and the 
provisions where under it was registered. Information as to whether  
TLP abides  by the political parties’ code of c onduct, whether it is 
foreign funded and whether it has  foreign membership  was also 
sought . The matter next came up for hearing on 16th November, 
2018 when it was noted  (in the following paragraphs ) that some of 
the information had still not been provided:   
2.  On the last date of hearing the Inter 
Services  Intelligence (“ ISI”) submitted CMA No. 8712/2018 
which was to be considered today. With the assistance of the 
learned DAG, we have examined the report which states that 
ISI can neither ascertain whether a person has a bank 
account nor if he is a  tax payer,  and such information can 
only be obtained from the State Bank of Pakistan (“ SBP”) and 
Federal Board of Re venue (“ FBR”) respectively. We  enquired 
from Brigadier Falak Naz, Director (Legal) about the 
law/regulations/instructions which determine the mandate 
of ISI. He states that ISI is governed by the “laws of the 
country”, but without mentioning any law. We ac cordingly 
direct the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, which is stated to 
be the ministry under which ISI comes, and the learned AGP 
to submit the law/rules/instructions  governing ISI and its 
mandate…  
 
5.  We expect the learned AGP to come prepared to 
attend  to the matters noted herein as well as those in earlier 
orders. We also need to determine the parameters of protests 
and how these have to be handled by the State. In this regard 
whether there are parallels with earlier protests and how 
those were handled , including those of 12th May, 2007 in 
Karachi and the Pakistan Tehreek -e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan 
Awami Tehreek (PAT) dharna  at D-Chowk, Islamabad.  
 
6.  To be continued to be treated as part heard. To 
come up on 22nd November, 2018.  
 
17. All the hearings in this case were conducted in open court. 
We had permitted those  aggrieved  and those whose interest  may be 
affected to come  forward and had also permitted  them to file 
documents and written submissions. Two applications were 
submitted.  The first application32 was by Syed Iftikhar Hussain 
Gilani, a senior advocate of this Court, who stated that his normal 
                                       
32 C. M. A. No. 8732/2017.  SMC. No. 7/2017  14
commute from his  residence to the Supreme Court  took about 
thirty -five minutes , which now, on account of the dharna , was 
taking three hours . He further compla ined that the administration  
had adopted  a siege mentality  by placing  large shipping containers 
across  roads to block  the protestors  from continuing their advance . 
He also pointed out that  the protest had spread to other parts of 
Pakistan and was causing massive losses to the economy. The 
other  application33 was submitted by Mr. Siraj Ahmad, a local 
advocate of Islamabad.  He drew attention  to the State ’s 
inconsistent approach and different treatment of protestors . He 
cited the 2014 dharna by two political parties,  the Pakistan 
Tehreek -e-Insaf (“ PTI”) and the Pakistan Awami Tehreek (“ PAT”), 
when  the State did not remove the  protestors  who gathered  in front 
of the Presidency , Parliament, Supreme Court, Prime Minster’s and 
Cabinet Secretariats , all of which fel l within the designated ‘Red 
Zone’. During the PTI -PAT dharna  the protestors had  camped on 
D-Chowk and on Constitution Avenue for over three months . He 
also wanted  this Court to inves tigate those , “responsible for 
tampering with divine law and abrogation of the provisions of the 
Constitution of Pakistan 1973 ”34. 
 
18. The last hearing in this case took place  on 22nd November, 
2018 when we again heard the learned AGP and others . After 
hearing them  we permitted an additional four weeks  for the  
submission  of documents,  reports and written arguments . 
However, there was no filing and the  four weeks ended  on 22nd 
December, 2018.

19. When this case commenced , both in the Federation and the 
Province of Punjab , the governments were of  the Pakistan Muslim 
League (N awaz ) (“PML (N) ”) with Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif  as 
the Prime Minister and Mr. Ashtar Ausaf Ali as the AGP. After the 
general election of 25th July, 2018 both these governments were 
replaced by the  PTI and Mr. Imran Khan became the Prime 
Minister and Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan the AGP. Mr. Anwar 
Mansoor Khan, the law officers of Punjab and those of the Capital 
Territory , representing PTI’s governments, s tood by the reports  
which had been  submitted during the tenure of the PML (N)  
governments.  
 
Previous Protests and TLP Dharna  
20. Mr. Siraj Ahmed  in his application35 complained that the 
protestors of the 2014  dharna by PTI -PAT were not treated  like 
those of the TLP . We also wanted to understand the difference in 
approach and had referred to the 12th May, 2007 Karachi 
massacre , the 2014 dharna by PTI-PAT in Islamabad (referred to by  
Mr. Siraj Ahmed ) and the TLP Faizabad Interchange dharna  by 
TLP36. Were the earlier gather ings handled differently by the State ?  
 
21. 12th May, 2007  Karachi Massacre : General Pervez 
Musharraf  had removed Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad 
Chaudhry on 9th March, 2007 . A peaceful movement , which came 
to be known as ‘The Lawyers Movement’, to restore him  and the 
independence of the judiciary  commenced . On 12th May, 2007 the 
Chief  Justice was flying  in to Karachi . Lawyers and people from all 
walks of life wanted  to receive the Chief J ustice at the airport  to 
                                       
35 C. M. A. No. 8803/2017.  
36 Order of 16th November, 2018.  SMC. No. 7/2017  16
express their support for him and an independent judiciary. 
General Musharraf however did not want the Chief Justice  to be 
welcomed . Massive shipping containers were brought from the port 
on trucks and by using  mobile  cranes  were placed  across all roads 
leading to the airport . But this did not deter the people,  who 
abandoned  their vehicles and peacefully proceed ed on foot  to the 
airport , and this is when they were targeted by gunmen . Fifty-five 
persons were mercilessly killed  and hundreds suffered bullet 
injuries  on 12th May. 2007 . The Mutta hida Qaumi Movement 
(“MQM ”) and its leader, Mr. Altaf Hussain , supported  General 
Musharraf . Incidentally, the shipping containers used to bloc k 
roads were brought from po rts, which were under the domain of 
the Federal Minister incharge of ports, a nominee of the MQM .  
  
22. 2014 dharna  by PTI-PAT at Islamabad : PTI, PAT and their 
supporters  had alleged that the results of the general elections 
held on 11th May, 2013 were rigged. They protested and camp ed 
outside the National Assembly, played loud music till late at night  
and disrupted  the peace  and sleep  of those  living in the area. 
Litigants, and even  judges, had to find alternative routes to reach  
the Supreme  Court.  The PTI-PAT dharna  took place  on 
Constitution Avenue , but  it did not paralyze the Capital . The PML 
(N), as a consequence of t he continuous pressure , agreed  to the 
demand of PTI to promulgate  a Presidential Ordinance  to enable  
the setting up of a judicial commission to inquire  into the conduct 
of the general e lections of 2013. The Statement of Objects and 
Reasons  of the Ordinance37 explains the matter:  
Pursuant to allegation of rigging in the General Elections 
2013 in particular by Pakistan Tehreek -e-Insaf, a political 
                                       
37 The General Elections 2013 Inquiry Commission  Ordinance, 2015, T he 
Gazette of Pakistan, Extraordinary, Part -I, dated 4th April, 2015.  SMC. No. 7/2017  17
party and denied by Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), a 
political p arty and a party in power, an accord was arrived 
at between them to setup a Commission to inquire into 
the allegation of rigging in the General Elections 2013. The 
Commission to be known as the General Elections 2013 
Inquiry Commission shall comprise three  Judges of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan to be constituted by the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan on the request of the Federal 
Government. The Commission shall inquire into and 
determine whether or not, the General Elections 2013 
were organised and conducted im partially, honestly, fairly, 
justly and in accordance with law; the General Elections 
2013 were manipulated or influenced pursuant to a 
systematic effort by design by anyone; and the results of 
the General Elections 2013, on an overall basis, are a true 
and fair reflection of the mandate given by the electorate . 
 
The judicial commission  which was  constituted was  headed 
by Mr. Nasirul Mulk, the then Chief Justice of Pakistan . He and 
two senior  judges were the  three -member Inquiry Commission , 
which  examined the allegations leveled by the PTI . The 
Commission found that,  “the 2013 general elections were in large 
part organized and conducted fairly and in accordance with the 
law”38. The Commission’ s findings were not disputed  by PTI . 
 
23. We have considered three different protests and the State’s 
handling of them. On 12th May, 2007 unarmed citizens  wanted to 
go to the airport to receive the Chief Justice  of Pakistan. The 
Constitution guarantees  the freedom of movement , however, 
citizens  were preve nted from g oing to the airport . Large  shipping 
containers were placed across roads  by the State at public 
expense . The citizens  were not deterred and  proceeded on foot  
when they were fired upon and by  day’s end  fifty-five lay dead and 
hundreds more were injured.  Seven years later came  the PTI -PAT 
dharna . The three -member  Inquiry  Commission , headed by  the 
Chief J ustice  of Pakistan , unanimously concluded  that the results 
of the general election s of 2013  reflected the mandate of the

people. Then t hree years later the country was  faced  with the TLP 
dharna . 
 
TLP’s Methodology   
24. The leadership of  TLP must have  noted  that despite the 
daylight slaughter of  innocents  on the streets of Karachi on 12th 
May, 2007  its principal conspirators and beneficiar ies were not 
punished . They must also have noted  that when  PTI-PAT had 
camp ed in the Red Zone for several months they had achieved  the 
setting up of a  judicial inquiry c ommission . Though the findings of 
the Inquiry Commission had rebutted  PTI’s allegations no adverse 
consequences followed . PTI’s leadership did not even tende r an 
apology, let alone clean  up the area or pay to clean and restore it. 
Instead PTI received a lot of free publicity. TLP had demanded that 
the words solemnly swear  in the declaration of Muslim candidates 
be restored. The government conceded  and the law was amended. 
As per  unanimous view of all the intelligence agencies TLP wanted 
to maximize political mileage for itself39. The ambitious leadership  
of a fledgling poli tical party  projected itself as the defender of the 
Muslim faith . They provoked  religious sentiment , stoked the flames 
of hatred, abused, resorted to violence  and destroyed property 
worth 163,952,000 rupees40. Nearly a ll economic activity in the 
country  was brought to a  virtual  standstill  by TLP . Pakistan’ s 
Gross Domestic Pr oduct for the year 2017  was 
32,406,956,000,000 rupees41, therefore, each day’s shutdown is

calculated  to be 88,786,180,821 rupees42. Intelligence agencies 
reported that politicians  visited TLP’s leadership  camped on the 
Faizabad Interchange43. TLP received  prime -time free media 
coverage and publicity, transforming it over night  into a household 
name. Two of its candidates got elected as members of the Sindh 
Assembly and TLP got a sizeable number of vo tes in the 25th July 
general elections .  
 
The Right to Protest  
25. The Constitution does not specifically stipulate a right to 
protest. However, democracy recogni zes such a right, and it was 
through democratic means that Pakistan was achieved.  The people 
of the subcontinent acquired  independence from British -colonial 
rule by the efforts of the All India Muslim League and the Indian 
National Congress; they peacefully protested, demonstrated, held 
meetings and expressed themselves through  election s, as a 
consequence of which two independent countries, Pakistan and 
India , emerged . Our Constitution is moored in democracy. The 
people of Pakistan have declared,  “that Pakistan  would be a 
democratic State ”44 and that its citizens are , “dedicated to the 
preservation of democracy ”45. Citizens  have the right to peacefully 
protest and hold demonstrations, and may do so against any 
action or decision of a government or authority. The right to 
protest is also implied in “the right to assemble peacefully ”46, in the 
“right to form associations  or union s”47, in the “ right to  form or be a 
                                       
42 32,406,956,000,000 divided by 365 is equal to  approximately

The Failure of the State   
26. The TLP and its followers, from all accounts, were 
determined to disrupt civic life. But, to meet this challenge there 
was little preparation or preplanning by the government, the police 
and other law enforcement agencies. No plan was apparently 
prepared to attend to the different eventualities likely to e merge50. 
The lack of preparedness to deal with similar events is most likely  
the situation even today. It is also not clear whether there was 
sufficient coordination between different authorities. A lack of 
vision, clarity and indecisiveness seemed to preva il. The District 
Magistrate of the Islamabad Capital Territory had written a letter51 
to the TLP  leadership stating that an order had been issued  under 
section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code , which prevented  
public gatherings and cautioned them to abide  by it. He had also 
informed them that if they wanted to protest they should do so at 
the Democracy Park or the Speech Corner and if they wanted to 
take out  a “Long March/Rally” they should obtain the requisite 
prior permission. TLP’s leadership paid no he ed to the District 
Magistrate ’s letter, yet  no prosecution was launched against them 
in this regard. When those breaking the law know that there shall 
be no consequences it only emboldens others. The citizens of

Pakistan have reposed their trust in the Sta te to ensure that their 
fundamental rights are upheld. Citizens must be kept safe, their 
properties protected and they should be allowed to move freely. 
The State however let them down.   
 
The Right to Assemble Peacefully  
27. The “right to assemble peacefully and without arms ”52 is 
“subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the 
interest of public order ”53. The right of assembly is recognized as a 
right to  preserve  the democratic  order , but it can not be used to 
overthrow a lawful  governme nt. Nor can the right of assembly  be 
used to bring about a  revolution or insurrection.  These principles 
were enunciated in the case of Islamic Republic of Pakistan v Abdul 
Wali Khan54:  
It goes without saying that while the right of Assembly is a 
very impor tant right for the preservation of a democratic 
political system yet it cannot be denied that no State can 
tolerate utterances or actions which threaten to overthrow 
the Government established by law in that State by 
unlawful or unconstitutional means. As observed by the 
American Supreme Court in the case of American 
Communications v. Douds [(1951) 340 US 268], ‘Freedom 
of speech, press and Assembly are dependent upon the 
power of the constitutional Government to survive. If it is 
to survive, it must have t he power to protect itself against 
unlawful conduct and, under some circumstance, against 
incitements to commit unlawful acts ’. 
 
The maintenance of public order is the paramount duty of 
the State. If anyone propagates, “ hatred or contempt , or excites  or 
attempts to excite disaffection towards the Federal or Provincial 
Government ”55 they commit the offence of sedition for which the 
punishment is imprisonment for life . TLP sowed discord and 
dissension, it resorted to mob -rule, rioting and the destruction  of 
property.

28. The House of Lords  of the U nited Kingdom has determined  
that, “ The right of assembly, of demonstration, is of great 
importance but in English  law it is not an absolute right which 
requires all limitations on other rights to be set aside or ignored ”56. 
With regard to assembly on a p ublic highway or a public place  it 
observed that if these :  
… are reasonable, do not involve the commission of a 
public or private nuisance, and do not amount to an 
obstruction of the highway  unreasonably impeding the 
primary right of the general public to pass and repas s, 
they should not constitute a trespass. Subject to these 
qualification s, therefore , there  would be a public right of 
peaceful assembly on the public highway.57  
 
29. The rights to free movement, peaceful assembly and freedom 
of speech and expression (respectively Article s 15, 16 and 19 of the 
Constitution ) are provided  in Articl e 19 of the Indian Constitution , 
but in India too such rights are not absolute . The Indian Supreme 
Court  elaborated  in the case of Bimal Gurun v Union of India58, 
that: 
Demonstrations whether political , religious or social or 
other demonstrations which create public disturbances or 
operate as nuisances, or create or manifestly threaten 
some tangible publ ic or private mischief, are not covered 
by protection under Article 19(1). A demonstration might 
take the for m of an assembly and even then the intention 
is to convey  to the person or authority to who m the 
communication is intended the feelings of the grou p which 
assembles. From the very nature of things a 
demonst ration may take various forms; ‘ it may be noisy 
and disorderly’ , for instance stone -throwing by a crowd 
may be cited as an example of a violent and disorderly 
demonstration and this would not obvio usly be within 
Article 19(1)(a) or (b)”.59

To maintain and preserve public peace, and public order 
is unequivocal duty of the State and its organs… There 
can be no social order or proper State governance without 
the State performing this function and duty in all its 
spheres.61 
 
 The right of assembly,  the freedom of association and the 
freedom of speech  cannot be exercised by infringing  the 
fundamental  rights of others . Without obtai ning permission public 
meetings cannot be held on roads . Nor can a road  be used as a 
camp ing ground  or to assemble  on it indefinitely.  Roads are  for 
vehicular use  and pavements are for the use of pedestrians  to 
enable the travelling public to move freely , which is  their 
fundamental right62. 
 
TLP and the Election Commission  
30. “Every citizen not being in the service  of Pakistan shall have 
the right to form or be a member of a political party ”63, however , as 
this fundamental r ight itself stipulates , it is one which vests in 
every  citizen  of Pakistan. Political part ies must not  act in a 
manner , “prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan ”64 
and they “shall account for the source of funds ”65. TLP was 
registered as a political party on 25th May, 201766 under the 
Political Parties Order, 2002. The Political Parties Order, 2002 was 
subsequently substituted on 2nd October, 2017 by the Elections 
Act, 2017 . The documents67 filed with the Election Commission

was “ entitled visa free entry to Pakistan ”, represent ed TLP before 
the Election Commiss ion and attend ed to all its matters  and 
secure d TLP’s  registration  as a political party . Subsection (4) of 
section 3  of the Political Parties Order, 2002  (the old law) and 
subsection (4) of section 200 of the Elections Act, 2017 (the new 
law) prohibit political parties  to: 
(a) propagate any opinion, or act in a manner 
prejudicial to the fundamental principles 
enshrined in the Constitution;  
 
(b) undermine the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, 
public order or public morality or indulge in 
terrorism;  
 
(c) promote sectarian, regional or provincial hatred or,

 The phrase “ foreign -aided political party ”, includes , receiving  
“any portion of its funds from foreign nationals ”69.  
 
31. If a political party “ is a foreign aided political party or has 
been formed or is op erating in a manner prejudicial to the 
sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan or is indulging in terrorism ” the 
Election Commission may submit a reference to the Federal 
Government  under section 212 of the Elections Act, 2017. When 
such a reference  is submit ted the Federal Government  may issue a

32. The Election Commission ’s report73 states  that TLP did not 
provide  information about  its funding despite  repeatedly directing 
it to do so . Section 211 of the Elections Act, 2017 and rule 161  (2) 
of the Elections Rules, 2017 , which were referred  to by the Election 
Commission in its notices to TLP,  require  that political parties 
submit the following financial details : 
  Section 211 of the Election s Act, 2017  
 
(1) A p olitical party shall furnish to the Commission the 
list of contributors who have dona ted or contributed an 
amount equal to or more than one hundred thousand 
rupees to the political party for  its election campaign 
expenses.  
 
(2) A political p arty shall furnish to the Commission 
details of the election ex penses incurred by it during a 
general e lection.  
 
  Rule 161 (2) of the Election s Rules, 2017  
 
(2) The details of election expenses under this rule shall be 
submitted by the political p arty within sixty days of the 
publication of the name s of returned candidates in the 
official gazette.  
 
 The Director General (Law) and the Secretary  of the Election 
Commission  confirmed  that TLP did not provide  the requisite 
financial information , however , stated that  the law is (to use their 
words) cosmetic in nature74 therefore the Election Commission 
could  not take action against TLP.

33. The Election Com mission is a constitutional body75 and t he 
Constitution  stipulates that the Election Commission shall ensure 
that, “the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in 
accordance with law, and that co rrupt practices are guarded 
against ”76. The Election Commission is also required to undertake,  
“such other functions as may be specified by an Act of Majlis -e-
Shoora (Parliament) ”77. Article 17 (3) of the Constitution requires 
political parties to account fo r the source of their funds and section 
211 of the Elections Act, 2017 demands that  details of election 
expenses  be provided . The Election Commission confirmed  that 
TLP did not account for its funds and election expenses, but , 
surprisingly , professes its helplessness  because the law  according 
to it  is cosmetic in nature . The Election Commission should  
disabuse itself that constitutional and legal provisions are 
cosmetic . The responsibilities placed on the Election Commission 
by the Constitution and the law  must  be fulfilled, they are not 
optional . The Constitution also empowers  the Election Commission 
to get requisite informati on from any executive authority - “All 
executive authorities in the Federation and in the Provinces to assist 
the Commissioner and t he Election Commission in the discharge of 
his or their functions ”78. 
 
Freedom of Speech, Expression, Press and PEMRA  
34. The freedom of speech and expression and of the press are 
fundamental rights79. However, t hese rights cannot be used to 
denigrate or undermine :

79 Article 19 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  SMC. No. 7/2017  27
… the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of 
Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign 
States , public order, decency or morality  or in relation  to 
contempt of court, or commission of or incitement to an 
offence.80 
 
The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority 
Ordinance , 2002 (the “ PEMRA Ordinance ”) mirrors the aforesaid 
restrictions as set out in the aforequoted Article 19 of the 
Constitution and further  prohibits broadcasts  which are , “likely to 
create hatred among the people or is prejudicial to the maintenance 
of law and order or is likely to disturb public peace and 
tranquility ”81. The licence s which PEMRA issues  further  stipulate  
that broadcast s cannot be made which , “encourage violence, 
terrorism, ra cial, ethnic or religious discrimination, sectarianism, 
extremism, militancy, hatred ”82. 
 
35. TLP’s leaders hip created  hatred  amongst the people , they 
abused, th reatened  and advocated violence ; and this was 
broadcast ed by some private television channels. ISI’s report83 
identified “Channel 92 ” as a television channel  supporting TLP and 
stated that its owners had supplied food to the protestors 
occupying the Faizabad Interchange. PEMRA , however , did not 
take action under the PEMRA Ordinance against any of its  
licenc ees for violat ing the terms of their licenc es. PEMRA abdicated 
its statutory duty , a duty which it was legally obliged to fulfi l.  
 
36. PEMRA also failed to protect the legitimate rights of its 
licensed broadcasters. Broadcasts by “DAWN” and “Geo”  television 
channels  were stopped/interrupted ; complaints stating  this were

acknowledged by PEMRA84. “DAWN” and “Geo” were particularly 
targeted  in the cantonment and defence housing a uthority areas  of 
the country , which too was  confirmed by PEMRA . But, s adly, 
PEMRA looked the other way. It did nothing to protect the interests 
of its licenc ees nor took action against those cable operators who 
were responsible . On 19th March, 2018 and on 24th April, 2018, 
information was sought from PEMRA as to who was responsible , 
but PEMRA  professed ignorance.  
 
37. In compliance  with our order85 the Pakistan 
Telecommunication Authority through the Deputy Attorney 
General for Pakistan submitted a report86 which pointed out that 
under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes A ct, 201687 the 
preparation and dissemination of hate speech  and terrorism  
through electronic means is a serious offence. Section  11 and 12 of 
this Act  respectively  state: 
11.   Hate speech   
Whoever prepares or disseminates information, through 
any information system or device, that advances or is 
likely to advance interfaith, sectarian or racial hatred, 
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to seven y ears or with fine or with both.  
 
12.   Recruitment, funding and planning o f terrorism   
Whoever prepares or disseminates information, through 
any information system or device, that invites or motivates 
to fund, or recruit people for terrorism or plans for 
terrorism shall be punished with imprisonment for a term 
which may extend t o seven years or with fine or with both.  
 
The hate which was spread and the violence which was 
incited  through electronic means  appears not to have been 
invest igated, let alone the violators  prosecuted and punished. If 
serious violation s of the law are ign ored then the law l oses respect 
and efficacy.

Censorship  
38. Television channels and newspapers had complained about 
interference in their broadcasts and the deli very of their 
publications. We,  therefore , tried to determine whether there was 
substance in their complaints. The organisation of journalists88, 
editors89, broadcasters90 and newspapers91 complained  that media 
is being suppressed and at times even silenced. The resolution92 of 
the Federal Executive Co uncil of Pakistan Federal Union of 
Journalists (“ PFUJ ”) make s troubling allegations :  
The Press Freedom in Pakistan is under great threat as 
there is an unannounced censo rship imposed by the S tate 
institutions across  in Pakistan … through coercion, control 
on advertisement, harassment and even carrying attacks 
on the journalists … Journalists in particular and society 
as a whole is scared of from those elements who are either 
guns, or claiming to be the religious god -fathers.   
 
The Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (“ CPNE”) has 
allege d93 “media repression ”, “that editors and journ alists are forced 
to self -censor their work amid pressure from certain quarters ” and it 
“appealed to all state and non -state actors to re frain from such 
unconstitutional pra ctices ”. It seems that “DAWN”, the oldest 
English language newspaper of the country, which was founded by 
Quaid -e-Azam  Muhammad Al i Jinnah , was targeted the most . 
 
39. Overt and cover t censorship is unconstitutional and illegal. 
Nebulous tactics, such as  issuing advice to self -censor , to suppress 
independent  viewpoints , to project prescribed ones, to direct who

should be hired or fired by media organisations is also illegal . This 
Court has castigated those who had resorted to such tactics in the 
past. It had directed that there should be  “no hindrance or 
obstruction ”94 of television broadcasts and the Provincial Police 
Officers  were directed  to take action against the perpetrators . No 
one, including any government, department or intelligence agency 
can curtail  the fundamen tal right of freedom of spee ch, expression 
and press beyond  the parameters mentioned  in Article 19 of the 
Constitution . Those who resort to such tactics under the mistaken 
belief that they serve some higher goal delude themselves. Paki stan 
is governed by the Constitution and, “ Obedience to the Constitution 
and the law is the inviolable obligation of every citizen wherever he 
may be and of every other person for the time being in Pakistan ”95.  
 
40. A half  century ago  Justice Brendeis96 of the Supreme Court 
of the United States of America  articulated  why the American 
Constitution had guaranteed free speech and assembly :  
Those who  won our independence believed t hat the final 
end of the state was to make men free to develop their 
faculties, and that in its government the deliberative 
forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued 
liberty both as an end and as a means . They believed 
liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the 
secret of  liberty. They believed that freedom to think as 
you will and to speak as you think  are means 
indispensible to the discovery and spread of political 
truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion 
would b e futile; that with them discussion affords 
ordinarily adequate protection  against the dissemination 
of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is 
an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; 
and that this should be a fundamen tal principle of the 
American government. They recognized the risks to which 
all human institutions are subject. But they knew that 
order cannot be secured  merely through fear of 
punishment  for its infraction; that it is hazardous to 
discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear 
breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate 
menaces stable government; that the path of safety lied in

the opportunity to discuss freely supposed  grievances and 
proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil 
counsels is good ones … Men feared witches and burnt 
women . It is the function of speech to free men from the 
bondage of irrational fears97.  
 
41. Freedom of speech, expression and the p ress are guaranteed 
as fundamental rights in the Constitution . Therefore, the 
quintessential words of  Justice Brendeis  are equally applicable to 
the rights conferred by the Constitution upon the citizens of this 
great country. Quaid -e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah wanted 
journalists to be responsible, independent and fearless and 
welcomed criticism. He said:  
The power of the press is great, but you must remember 
that this power which you are wielding is a trust. Look 
upon it as a gr eat trust, and remember that you are 
guiding honestly and sincerely the progress and welfare of 
your nation. At the same time, I expect you to be 
completely fearless … If I go wrong, or if the League goes 
wrong in any direction of its policy or programme, I  want 
you to criticise it honestly .98 
 
Intelligence Agencies  
42.  The report submitted by ISI did not disclose  the “source of 
livelihood, place of work, address, funding of their organisations, et 
cetera ”99 of the TLP leadership. Subsequently, we had i nquired 
whether they paid income tax or had bank accounts.  ISI responded 
by stating that it did not have the mandate to gather  such 
information and  therefore was unable to  provide answers to our 
queries100. The learned AGP  was thus asked101 to inform us about  
the law/rules/ regulations governing ISI and its mandate . The 
learned AGP tendered  a document (in a sealed envelope ) which 
spelled  out ISI’s mandate , but requested  that the mandate  of ISI 
should  not be disclosed . He did not give any  reason for such

secrecy except that this was also the practice in other countries 
but did not cite the example of a single one. We, therefore 
ascertain ed whether other countries  maintained secrecy  about  the 
mandate of  their intelligence agencies.

 We are disappointed in the manner in which the Government 
handled this aspect of the case ; by ignoring an issue it does not go 
away. The perception that ISI may be  involved in or interferes with 
matters with which an intelligence agency should no t be concern ed 
with, including politics , therefore was no t put to rest.  
 SMC. No. 7/2017  33
44. The late Air Marshal Asghar Khan, the youngest officer who 
headed Pakistan’s Air Force, was concerned that  ISI and some  
Armed Forces personnel pursued  a political agenda. He expressed 
these concerns  to the Supreme  Court and this Court took 
cognizance  of the matter under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution , 
as it was a matter  of public importanc e regarding the enforcement 
of fundamental rights. T he decision102 of this  Court referred to the 
oath, “Every member of the Armed Forces shall make ”103 swearing 
“allegiance to Pakistan and [to] uphold the Constitution ” and “ not 
engage myself in any political activities whatsoever ”104. The 
decision in the case of Air Marshal  Asghar Khan  declared , that: 
Involvement of the officers/members of secret agencie s i.e. 
ISI, MI, IB, etc. in unlawful activities, individually or 
collectively calls for strict action being, violative of oath of 
their offices, and if involved, they are liable to be dealt 
with under the Constitution and the Law.105 
 
45. Pursuant to the judgment in Air Marshal Asghar Khan ’s case 
the involvement of ISI and of the  members of the Armed Forces in 
politics, media and other “unlawful activities ” should have stopped. 
Instead  when TLP’s dharna  participants received  cash handouts 
from men in uniform106 the perce ption of their involvement gained  
traction. The Director General of the Inter -Services Public 
Relations ( “ISPR”) has also taken to commenting  on political 
matters:  “history will prove the 2018 general elections were 
transparent ”107. The Armed Forces, and all agencies manned by the

personnel of the Armed Forces, including ISI, Military Intelligence 
(“MI”) and I SPR serve  Pakistan , and thu s all its citizens . They must 
never  be perceived  to support a particular  political party, faction or 
politician.  If any personnel of the Armed Forces indulges in any 
form of politicking  or tries to manipulate  the media he undermines 
the integrity and professionalism of the Armed Forces. The duties  
of the Armed Forces are clearly spelt out in the Constitution , they , 
“shall under the direction of the Federal Government defend 
Pakistan against external aggression or threat of war, and, subject 
to law, act in aid civil power when called upon to do so ”108. We must 
not allow the honour  and esteem due to those who lay down their 
lives for others  to be undermined by the illegal actions of a few.  
 
46. ISI states that it cannot monitor the financials of those 
advocating violence and carrying out violent acts. However,  in the 
context of terrorism , the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 does envisage a 
role for “ Intelligence Agencies, Armed Forces and Civil Armed 
Forces ”109. Intelligence agencies should not ignore  those who 
promote  violence and hate. If the proponents of violent ide ology  
and action  are not monitored and checked they often mutate  
against the State and terrorize  the people . Those who resort to 
abuse, hate and violence should never be pampered , instead they 
should  fear the State, its p olice and intelligence agencies . 
 
47. The Directorate of the Inter Service Intelligence was 
established  during the Premiership  of Mr. Liaqu at Ali Khan . The 
Directorate’s first  head, designated as the Director of Intelligence ,

was Brigadier S. Shahid Hamid110. With very limited resources  the 
Directorate  had managed to fulfill its assigned responsibilities and 
it did so professionally and by strictly adhering  to its prescribed  
mandate (as disclosed to us) , which did not include  either  politics 
or the media . The newly founded State of Pakistan, which includ ed 
the then East Pakistan, quickly rose in stature and gained a place 
of res pect in the comity of nations. W hen institutions stay within 
their designated constitutional boundaries and  there is  an effective 
system of check and balance , citizens  stay safe and the State 
prospers . The trouble starts with s elf-proclaimed -saviours , who 
must  be reminded that sovereignty , “belongs to Almighty Allah 
alone, and the authority to be exercised… is a sacred trust ”111. 
Quaid -e-Azam  Muhammad Ali Jinnah  visualized  Pakistan to be , 
“based on the fundamental principles of democracy, not bureaucracy 
or autocracy or dictatorship ”112. We must hold stead fast to the 
Constitution and the ideals  of our leader . 
 
Freedom Movement and Pakistan  
48. Pakistan was achieved through d emocratic and 
constitutional means . The All India Muslim League and its 
President, Mr. Jinnah, articulated their demands  and peacefully 
strove to achieve them . They  did not  exhort  their followers  to 
violence. They did not abuse or threaten  the British  rulers, from 
whom they wanted freedom , nor their political opponents, the 
Indian National Congress, or any religious community . The 
leadership of the League  was guided by the great example of 
                                       
110 Brigadier S. Shahid Hamid, who retired from Pakistan Army as a Major 
General, was the elder brother of Qazi Faez Isa, J’s mother.

112 Air Marshal (Retd.) Muhammad Asghar Khan v General (Retd.) Mirza Aslam 
Baig, Former Chief of Army Staff  (PLD 2013 SC 1, 101)  [84], quoting Quaid -e-
Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.  SMC. No. 7/2017  36
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) , the 
founder of the great Islamic tradition of akhlaq (ethics and morals) 
and aadab (decency and etiquette), who never uttered  an abuse 
nor a word which could be construed  as abusive. M en and women 
of integrity, sincerity and good manners  achieved Pakistan . 
 
Islam  
49. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is 
designated as Rehmatul lil Aalameen (Mercy of the Worlds). Divine 
revelation states that his was  a “great moral character ”113 (khuluqin 
azimin ). The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)  said, “I am 
sent only to perfect the noble qualities of character ”114; to bring 
about a moral -ethical transformation. He was the epitome of  
virtue, ethics, morality and self -abnegation . Threatening another, 
violating the law , occupying public roads,  destroy ing property, 
injuring  or causing  death does not emulate  the example of the 
Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) , his akhlaq and aadab . 
Those who employ  such tactics  cannot be the standard bearer s of 
the Muslim faith.  Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be 
upon him)  taught his followers to live in peace  and taught them  to 
greet by saying – “assalam -u-aleykum ” (peace be upon you)  and to 
respond  to the greeting  by saying  - “walaykum assalam ” (and upon 
you too) or with  a still better response – “waleykum assalam wa 
rahmatullahe barakatuhu ” (and upon you too and upon you be the 
Blessings and the Mercy of Allah).  Muslims must remain  vigilant 
against  the self-righteous and arrogant . “The servant s of (Allah)  
Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and 
when the ignorant address them, they say, ‘Peace ’ ”. The Almighty 
                                       
113 Al-Quran, Surah Al-Qalam (68) verse 4.  
114 Reported in Tirmidhi . SMC. No. 7/2017  37
dislikes pride and conceit – “Allah likes not the proud and boastful ”. 
Those hurling abuses  wantonly  need to study  the Holy Quran 
which denigrates even the raising of one’s voice – “The harshest of 
sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass ”115. 
 
50. The first words inscribed  in the Constitution are – “In the 
name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful ”116. Its 
preamble  then unequivocal ly affirms  that sovereignty belongs to 
Allah Almighty alone and that the authority is to be exercised by 
the people “ within the limits prescribed by Him ”117. The 
Constitution does not permit  “the glory of Islam ”118 to be 
denigrated . When a mob abuses, threatens and resorts to violence 
ostensibly  in the name of Islam  it does  exactly  this. True believers 
abhor  such conduct . Slowly, and over a period of time, the real 
face of Islam is being effaced and the voices of believers, who 
practice akhlaq and aadab , have been muffled. Ironically, t he most 
offensive speech and violent behavior purports to represent Islam 
and Muslims ; this is against Islam and the sunnah  of Prophet 
Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) . The Constitution 
holds out the promise that Muslims  will be enabled  to live “ in 
accordance with the fundamental principles and basic concepts of 
Islam ”119, and the State shall endeavo ur, “to promote unity and 
observance of the Islamic moral standard ”120. Abuse, threats and 
violence are the antithesis of the Islamic moral standard .

51. This case brought to the fore a number of important matters. 
We examined the Constitution, determined what constitutes public 
importance, interpreted fundamental rights, considered the 
consequences of institutional overreach, the tactics used to achieve 
political agendas, how the State protects citizens and their 
fundamental rights, the security mechanisms in place, the 
mandate and role of the intelligence agencies, the independence 
and obligations of the media , the responsibilities of PEMRA, the 
role of the Election Com mission and what Islam teaches.  
 
52. We are aware that some of the matters  considered by us are 
moral , political  and religious . For instance , those in government on 
12th May, 2007  (when unarm ed citizens were massacred)  or those 
who extended support  to the Faizabad Interchange mob  (who 
disrupted ci vic life and destroyed property)  are today in coveted 
positions at t he hi ghest levels of government. W hile the general 
moral decline and the loss of political and religious values can only 
be commented upon  we however have not  lost sight of the 
parameters of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184 (3) of 
the Constitution.  
 
Conclusion  
53. For the reasons mentioned above this case is disposed of 
with the following  declarations and directions:  
 
(1) Subject to reasona ble restrictions imposed by law , citizens 
have the right to form and to be members of political parties . 
 SMC. No. 7/2017  39
(2) Every citizen and political party has the right to assemble 
and protest provided such assembly and protest is peaceful 
and complies with the law imposing reasonable restrictions 
in the interest of public order. The right to assemble and 
protest is circumsc ribed only to the extent that it infringes  
on the fundamental rights of others, including their right to 
free movement  and to hold and enjoy property .  
 
(3) Protestors who obstruct  people’s right to use roads and 
damage or destroy property must be proceeded ag ainst in 
accordance with the law and held accountable.  
 
(4) The Constitution earmarks the responsibilities of the 
Election Commission which  it must fulfill. If a political party 
does not comply with the law governing political parties then 
the Election Commiss ion must proceed agains t it in 
accordance with the law.  The law  is most certainly not 
cosmetic  as contended on beha lf of the Election Commission.  
 
(5) All political parties have to account for the source of their 
funds in accordance with  the law. 
 
(6) The State must always act impartially and fairly. The law is 
applicable to all, including those who are in government and 
institutions must act independently of those in government.  
 
(7) When the State failed to prosecute those  at the highest  
echelons of government  who were responsible for the murder 
and attempted murder of peaceful citizens on the streets of SMC. No. 7/2017  40
Karachi on 12th May, 2007  it set a bad precedent and 
encouraged others to resort to vio lence to achieve their 
agendas.  
 
(8) A person issuing  an edict or fatwa , which ha rms another or 
puts another in harm’s way , must be criminally prosecuted 
under  the Pakistan Penal Code , the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 
and/or the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 . 
 
(9) Broadcasters who broadcast  messages advocating  or inciting  
the commission of an offence violate the PEMRA Ordinance 
and the terms of their licences and must  be proceeded 
against by PEMRA in accordance with the law.   
 
(10) Cable operators who stopped or interr upted the broadcast of 
licenced broadcasters must  be proceeded against by PEMRA 
in accordance with the PEMRA Ordinance , and if this was 
done on the behest of others then PEMRA should report 
those so directing the cable operators to the concerned 
authorities.  
 
(11) Those spreading  messages through electronic means  which 
advocate or incite the commission of an offence  are liable to 
be prosecut ed under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 
2016.  
 
(12) All intelligence agencies (including ISI, IB and MI) and the 
ISPR must not  exceed their respective mandates. They 
cannot curtail the freedom of speech and expression and do SMC. No. 7/2017  41
not have the authority to interfere with broadcast s and 
publication s, in the management of broadcaster s/publisher s 
and in the distribution of newspapers.  
 
(13) Intelligence agencies should  monitor acti vities of all those 
who threaten the territorial integrity of the country and all 
those who undermine the security of the people and the 
State by resorting to or inciting violence.  
 
(14) To best ensure transparency and the rule of law it would be 
appropriate t o enact laws  which  clearly stipulate  the 
respective  mandates of the intelligence agencies.  
 
(15) The Constitution emphatically prohibits members of the 
Armed Forces from engaging in any kind of political activity, 
which includes supporting a political party, faction or 
individual. The Government of Pakistan through the Ministry 
of Defence and the respective Chiefs of the Army, the Navy  
and the Air Force are directed to initiate action against the 
personnel under their command who are found to  have 
violated their oath.   
 
(16) The police and other law enforcement agencies are directed 
to develop standard plans and procedure with regard to  how 
best to handle rallies, protests and dharnas , and ensure that 
such plans/procedures are flexible enough to attend to 
different situations. It is clarified that though the making of 
such plans/procedures is not within the jurisdiction of this 
Court however we expect that in the maintenance  of law and SMC. No. 7/2017  42
order every effort will be taken to avoid causing injury and 
loss of life.  
 
(17) We direct the Federal and provincial governments to monitor 
those advocating hate, extremism and terrorism and 
prosecute the perpetrators in accordance with the law.  
 
54.  It would be apt to conclude  this judgmen t by quoting Quaid -
e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah:  
I consider it my duty to call upon the Muslims to temper 
their resentment with reaso n and to beware of the dangers  
which may well overwhelm their own State. Should they 
allow their feelings of th e moment to gain mastery over 
their actions .121 
 
It is of utmost importance that Pakistan should be kept 
free from disorder, because the outbreak of lawlessness… 
is bound to shake… its foundation and cause irreparable 
damage to its future .122 
 
I pray to God th at He who has bestowed on us this great 
boon of a sovereign State, may now give our people 
courage to… preserve intact the peace of Pakistan for the 
sake of Pakistan .123
