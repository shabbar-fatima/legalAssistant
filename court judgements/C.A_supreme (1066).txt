Civil Petition No.4333 of 2021 a nd Civil Petitions No.1503, 
1504 & 1505 of 2022 : Through these petitions orders dated 28 
April 2022 and 30 June 2021 passed by the Islamabad High Court 
are assailed. Learned Attorney -General  for Pakistan (‘ AGP’) states 
that he is under instructions to with draw these petition s. He 
further states that  the orders impugned herein have been  
implemented and that he will be filing  a concise statement in this 
regard. Accordingly these petitions are dismissed  as withdrawn, 
however, learned AGP to file concise statemen t as stated.  
2. Constitution Petition No.50 of 2023 : Mrs. Amina Masood 
Janjua  states that her husband Mr. Masood Janjua was travell ing 
from Rawalpindi to Peshawar on 30 July 2005 and has not been 
found since. She states that she approached the Commission of 
Enquiry on Enfo rced Disappearances (‘ the Commission ’), which 
was notified by the Federal Government , compris ing of the 
following:  
Justice Javed Iqbal, former Judge SCP, Chairman  
Justice Amanull ah Yaseenzai, former Judge HC B, Member  
Justice Zi a Pervaiz, former Judge HC S, Member  
Muhammad Sharif Virk, Member  
She states that she is not satisfied with the working of the 
Commission. The other petitioners too have expressed reservation s 
about the effectiveness of the Commission.  
3. Mr. Khalid Naseem , the Registrar of the Commission , states 
that the Commission has done considerable work and due to its 
efforts  a number of persons  have been recovered/ returned home.  
On our query he states that the Commission does not work 
voluntarily but has a budget and  its Chairman, Members and 
employees are paid by the Government.   
4. Mr. Faisal Siddiq i, Advocate  Supreme Court,  present in 
Court has  stepped -up to  render assistance . He has pointed out 
that the production orders  issued by the Commission have not 2S. C.P.1503 of 2022, etc. (final)    3  
   been honoured. Sinc e this matter pertains to  Fundamental Rights 
and assistance is required  by this Court, we appoint  Mr. Faisal 
Siddiqi, ASC, as amicus  curiae . The Federal Government shall 
refund  his costs of travel and lodging .  
5. C.M.Appeal.124/2022 : The Registrar  has raised objections 
on the maintainability of  the constitution petition filed by Mr. 
Khushdil Khan Malik , who has also raised  his personal grievances  
therein . Office objections are overruled and his petition be 
numbered , however, we restrict his petition to the ext ent of 
missing person s and if he has any  other grievances the same may 
be raised at the appropriate forum.  
6. C.M.Appeal.161/2023 : The Registrar  has raised objections 
on the maintainability of constitution petition  filed by Mr. Aitzaz 
Ahsan, a Senior Advoc ate. The petition also atten ds to matter of 
missing persons, but also refers to a few politically aligned persons 
who are stated to have been picked up and have since returned 
home. Those persons who have returned cannot be categorized  as 
missing per sons, in respect of whom writs  of habeas corpus can be 
issued. Moreover, the petitioner has not been authorized to 
represent them. Therefore, while we overrule the office objections 
we restrict the scope of this petition to missing persons. Office is 
directed to  number the petition . 
7. During the course of hearing reference was made to the Bill 
submitted in the National Assembly with regards to the subject of 
missing persons and that when it reached the Senate it vanished . 
Therefore, we enquired who was  the custod ian of the Senate and 
were told that it was  the Chairman Senate, Mr. Sadiq Sanjrani, 
who was elected by those who were then in government. It is 
alleged that a Federal Minister’s efforts were thwarted by the 
Chairman Senate, who was elected by the votes of  the same party. 
This is a very serious allegation levelled against Mr. Sadiq Sanjrani 
and which pertains to missing persons. However, we note that the 
Chairman Senate, Mr. Sadiq Sanjrani, has not been arrayed as a 
party, therefore, unless the petitioner array s him as a party it 
would not be appropriate to  attend to  allegations  made against 
him. 2S. C.P.1503 of 2022, etc. (final)    4  
   8. To proceed further in a meaningful manner and with a view 
to resolve this matter it would be appropriate to ascertain facts 
from the Commission. Therefore, the Commission is direct ed to 
collate and submit : (a) the names with parentage and addresses of  
those who went missing,  (b) name and relationship of the person 
who reported the missing person , (c) the date they went  missing, 
(d) those who w ere in government in the Federation and the 
concerned province  at that time , (e) wheth er the missing person 
was recovered or not,  and (f) if not  recovered the efforts, if an y, 
taken to find out the whereabouts  of the missing person. In 
addition, (g)  all those in respect of who m production orders  were 
issued but were not produced, and (h) what w as the follow -up by 
the Commission when its production orders were not complied 
with.  
9. The above information be provided electronically and 
through hard copy to the office of the  learned  Attorney -General 
within ten days, who upon receipt thereof will submit resp onse, 
including  why production orders  issue d by the Commission  were 
not complied with, within twenty days after the Commission 
supplies the said information. The learned Attorney -General to 
submit report (hard copy and electronically) to this Court.  
10. It will be appropri ate if the budget, staff and resources of the 
Commission are disclosed,  as the people ’s Fundamental Right, 
under Article 19A of the Constitution, grants them the right to 
information.  
11. The Federal Government is directed to submit undertaking 
in w riting, signed by seni or most o fficers of the concerned 
ministries, that henceforth no one shall be picked up other  than in 
accordance with the law.  
12. During the hearing it was brought to our attention that 
during the Court’s winter vacations the families of protesting 
missing perso ns at Islamabad  were manhandled  by police/law 
enforce ment  personnel . This Court takes great exception to such 
high h andedness because the right to peaceful protest is amongst 
the guaranteed Fundamental Rights which must be honourd in 
letter and spirit. This Court has a lready held that:  2S. C.P.1503 of 2022, etc. (final)    5  
   ‘Every citizen and political party has the right to 
assemble and protest provided such assembly and 
protest is peaceful and complies with the law 
imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of 
public order. The right to assemble and protest is 
circumscribed only to the extent that it infringes on 
the fundamental rights of others, including their 
right to free movement and to hold and enjoy 
property. ’1 
13. To be fixed in Court for further proceedings after expiry of 
the documentation pe riod.
