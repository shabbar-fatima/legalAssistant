ORDER  
 We had earlier directed the personal attendance of the appellant, Mr. Qasim 
Khan Soori , and repeated attempts have been made to effect service upon him. 
The process server’s report states that the appellant’s  brother, Mr. Bilal Soori , 
refused to receive notice on his behalf. It has become quite clear that the appellant 
is avoiding service of notice which conduct , by a former parliamentarian and 
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly , is unfortu nate.  
 
2. Therefore, since the appellant is avoiding service he be served through 
publication in U rdu newspaper Jang  published from Quetta and English 
newspaper DAWN . Notice be also sent  to him  by registered post and it should also 
be sent through process server and pasted on the outer door  of his last k nown 
address. The notices  should state that the appellant is required to  personally 
attend the Court on the next date of hearing , which is Tuesday, 9 July 2024.
