ORDER  
 Jawwad S. Khawaja, J .- Crl. O. P. 115/2015:  When this case was called, a letter 
dated 17.3.2015 was placed before us through  Crl. M .A. No.245 of 2015 which had been 
issued by Bashir Ahmed (Director Industries and Labour) ICT. The contents of the letter are 
reproduced below be cause of their  relevance :- 
“In pursuance of the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s orders dated 16th March, 2015, in 
CRPs No. 315, 316 of 2013 in CMAs -6158 -6159/13 in SMC -20 of 2007 AND 
Crl.O.P.No. 115 of 2014, Mining Lease of M/s FECTO Cement Limited issued vide  
letter No.DDI&MD/ICT/LL -5/Vol -1/2467, dated 21 -12-2011 is hereby cancelled with 
immediate effect. You are directed to stop all activities and remove all installation 
forthwith”     
2. Upon the cursory examination of the letter, it is evident to us that the n ame of this 
Court has been used in an unjustified manner because we had unambiguously mentioned 
in our order of 16.3.2015 that we would ensure compliance of our order of 25.10.2013, the 
relevant part thereof, for ease of reference, is reproduced:  
“5.   Thu s, Chairman CDA, Chairman NHA and any other executing agency are 
hereby restrained not to undertake any exercise towards the construction of Tunnel in 
the Margallah Hills enroute to the Province of KPK, nor CDA shall grant licence of 
crushing stones from t he Margallah Hills. The Chairman CDA is further directed to 
constitute a team which shall put up a report that no activity of constructing of 
Tunnel or crushing of stones or encroachment or any other activity in the National 
Park is going on. If there is a ny such activity, the same shall be stopped at once. Copy 
of the compliance report shall be submitted before this Court through Registrar for our 
perusal in Chambers and passing further orders if need be” . 
 
3. We may note that the Director (Industries and Labour) was directed telephonically 
to appear and explain the contents of his letter. However, because it was already much 
after Court hours and he was unable to reach the Court before we rose for the day, the 
matter is being adjourned for hearing tomorrow  i.e. 19.3.2015.
