These Intra Court Appeals filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice 
and Procedure) Act , 2023 are directed against the impugned  Order dated 
23.10.2023 passed by the learned b ench of this Court in Constitution Petition 
Nos.24, 25, 26, 27,  28, 30 & 35 of 2023, whereby , for detailed reasons to be 
recorded  later, the aforesaid Constitution  Petitions were decided in the 
following terms:  
 
 
“ORDER OF THE COURT  
 
For detailed reasons to be recorded later, and subject to such 
amplification and/or explanation therein as is considered 
appropriate, these petitions are decided in the following terms:  
 
 i. It is hereby declared by Mr. Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan, Mr. Justice 
Munib Akhtar, Mr. Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and 
Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik that clause (d) of subsection (1) of 
Section 2 of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (in both of its sub 
clauses (i) & (ii)) and subsection (4) of Section  59 of the said Act 
are ultra vires the Constitution and of no legal effect.  
 
ii. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the trials 
of civilians and accused persons, being around 103 persons who 
were identified in the list provided to the Co urt by the learned ICAs 5 -25/23  3 
 
Attorney General for Pakistan by way of CMA No.5327 of 2023 in 
Constitution Petition No.24 of 2023 and all other persons who 
are now or may at any time be similarly placed in relation to the 
events arising from and out of 9th and 10th May, 2023 shall be 
tried by Criminal Courts of competent jurisdiction established 
under the ordinary and / or special law of the land in relation to 
such offences of which they may stand accused.  
 
iii. It is further declared that any action or proceedings u nder 
the Army Act in respect of the aforesaid persons or any other 
persons so similarly placed (including but not limited to trial by 
Court Martial) are and would be of no legal effect.  
 
iv. Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi reserves judgment as to para (i) 
above,  but joins the other members of the Bench as regards 
paras (ii) and (iii)”  
 
  
2. The learned counsel for the appellants  argued , inter alia , that on 
09.05.2023, numerous military installations and establishments throughout 
the country  faced  targeted attacks  for which several  First Information Reports  
(FIRs ) were lodged at different Police Stations. In itially, in some FIRs, the 
offences covered under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (“Army Act ”) were not 
mentioned , but subsequently  the said offences were also added  for the trial of 
the accused  persons . According  to the learned counsel, 103 persons have been 
found to be involved in the offenc es under the Army Act, and were taken into 
custody  in accordance with law and procedure . It was further contended that 
the detailed reasons in support of the short order ha ve not been released by the 
learned bench so far , but keeping in mind the urgency , and to avoid the rigors 
of limitation, the present Intra Court Appeals have been filed without prejudice 
to the right of  filing  amended memo  of appeal s upon the detailed reasons  being 
released . It was further averred that, in the light of sub -clause (a) to clause (3) 
of Article 8 of the Constitution  of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , 1973  
(“Constitution ”), the laws relating to members of the Armed Forces for the 
purpose of ensuring the proper discharge of their duties or the maintenance of 
discipline among them are not susceptible to be adjudged on the touchstone of 
the Fundamental Rights as contained in the Constit ution . It was further 
contended that while declaring clause (d) of sub -section (1) of Section 2 of the  
Army Act  (in both of its sub -clauses (i) and (ii)) , and sub -section (4) of Section 
59 of the said Act as ultra vires  the Constitution , the learned b ench has 
deviated from the ratio of the judgment  rendered by this Court in Brig. (Retd.) 
F. B. Ali's case  (infra) whereby the provisions of the Army Act  were declared 
intra vires  the Constitution , hence there was no justification for holding clause 
(d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Army Act  (in both its sub -clauses (i) 
and (ii)), and sub - section (4) of Section 59 of the said Act ultra vires  the ICAs 5 -25/23  4 
 
Constitution.  It was further argued that the c ourts under the Army Act do not 
form part of the judicial hierarchy contemplated by Articles 175 and 203 of the 
Constitution and , as such, neither the provisions of clause (3) of Article 175 of 
the Constitution , nor those of Article 203 are applicable to , or have any 
relevance to the said Courts.  It was further c ontended that the process of trial 
under the Army Act is consistent with the recognized  principles of criminal 
justice as held in Brig. (Retd.) F. B. Ali's case  (PLD 1975 SC 506 ), Shahida 
Zahir Abbasi's case  (PLD 1996 SC 632 ), and the majority judgment of this 
Court rendered in the case of  District Bar Rawalpindi  case (PLD 2015 SC 
401). It was further contended that clause 2 (d) was inserted  into the Army Act  
vide Section 2 of the Defence Services Laws Amendment  Ordinance , 1967 
which is protected under Art icle 268 of the Constitution. It was further argued 
that due to the striking down of the law in question by dint of the impugned  
order, no action can be taken against the hardcore  criminals and terrorists 
involved in the attacks on army installations and/ or against the martyr dom of 
innocent civilians  and personnel of the armed forces  who are devoting and 
sacrificing their precious lives to combating the menace of terrorism . He further 
argued that even in the present situation, no action can be taken agains t the 
persons accused of espionage. In the end, all the counsel for the appellants 
collectively  request ed that the impugned  Order may be suspended till further 
orders , because the detailed  reasons have not been released .  
 
 
3. Although it is the first date  of hearing and no notice has been issued to the 
respondents , some of the respondents are represented by their counsel who 
addressed their preliminary arguments . They have  insisted that the detailed 
reasons be allowed to be released by the learned bench of  this Court before the 
passing of any interim order (s) in these Intra Court Appeals , but it is an 
admitted position that the detailed reasons have not been released  hitherto to 
expound and amplify  the reasons for striking down  the law in question.   
 
 
4. Issue notice to the respondents  for a date that may be fixed by the office in 
the third week of January  2024. Office is further directed  to append the 
detailed reasons , if released  by the learned bench initially seized of the matter , 
on the next date of he aring.  
 
 
CMAs No.10534 to 10551  of 2023   
 
 
Notice. Since t he appellants have raised various questions of law which require 
consideration , therefore  till the next date of hearing, with the majority of five  to ICAs 5 -25/23  5 
 
one (the latter being Musarrat Hilali -J, who only issued n otice on the stay 
application s and main appeals ), the operation of the impugned Order striking 
down clause (d) of subs ection (1) of Section 2 of the  Army Act (in both of its sub 
clauses (i) & (ii) ), and subsection (4) of Section 59 of the said  Act as being ultra 
vires the Constitution , is suspended subject to the condition that no final 
judgment shall be passed against the 103 accused persons  by the Military  
Courts .  
The Civil Misc. Application No.10514/2023 filed by respondent No.1 in 
ICA.No.5 /2023 for reconstitution of bench and Civil Misc. Application 
No.10522/2023 filed by respondent No s.1 to 5 in ICA No.10/2023 for
