ORDER  
 
  Jawwad S. Khawaja, J. - When we ha d taken up this 
matter at Sl. No.1  first thing in the morning,  Mr. Aamir Rehman, 
learned Addl. AGP stated that there is a meeting in progress on this 
matter and if  the case can be taken up after 12:00  noon, he will be 
able to place complete information b efore the Court. At 11:15 a.m. , 
we have exhausted the cause list. In these circumstances, let the 
hearing of t his matter continue in Chambers at 12:00 noon.  
In Chambers at 12:00 noon  
2.  The learned Attorney General for Pakistan is also now 
present. He sta tes that the matter in the Senate has passed the 
Committee Stage on 30.6.2015. The proposed legislation has now 
been placed in the current session of the Senate on 6th July, 2015 and 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Senate will take a decision 
on the matter during the current week.  
3.  The reason for our concern in this matter is that the 
citizens of the Islamabad Capital Territory s till appear to be waiting Constn. P. No.77 -2010 etc ICT elections  - 3 - 
 3 for Local Government Elections. The last such elections were held in 
the Islamabad Capita l Territory in 1992 and already a period of 23 
years has elapsed since then. The urgency in the matter and the need 
to provide elected Local Governments at the gr ass-roots level, at the 
earliest, cannot be gainsaid , particularly in view of the fact that Local 
Government Elections have already been held in Balochistan, KPK 
and in the Cantonment Boards while  such election in Si ndh and 
Punjab are scheduled for mid -September.   
4.  Needless to say , in view of the fact that the expected 
legislation is not as yet in place, the Election Commission of Pakistan 
may notify a revised schedule f or the said elections  if this becomes 
necessary on account of delays in Parliament.  We may note that the 
National Assembly passed the Local Government Bill on 26.3.2015 
and since then it is pending with the Senate.  
5.  To come up on 03.8.2015  when we may consider the 
possibility  of Local Government Elections under previously existing 
legislation, so that the citizens of ICT  are not discriminated against 
and receive their right t o elect their local bodies.
