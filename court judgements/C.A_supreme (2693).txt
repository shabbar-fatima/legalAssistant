ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ . –  
CIVIL REVIEW PETITION NO. 199 OF 2010 :  
  The learned AOR for the petitioner does not pr ess this 
review petition. Dismissed.  
CIVIL REVIEW PETITION NO. 129 OF 2010 : 
2.   Mr. Kamal Azfar, Sr. ASC read out a written statement (not 
filed in Co urt) and stated that though it wa s always a privilege to 
appear and assist th e apex  Court, but in the in stant case, the 
Federation of Pakistan had taken away brief from him,  and instructed  
Dr. Khalid Ranjha to appear and argue the case. It was pointed out to 
him that in his letter dated 30th October, 2010, after having tendered 
resignation from the post of A dvisor to the Prime Minister against 
which he was appointed a day or so before the hearing of the petition 
fixed on 13th October, 2010, he had stated that he was available to 
argue the case. The contents of the letter are reproduced below: -  CRP 129/201 0 etc. 
3 
“This has ref erence to your letter dated 29 October 2010 
Ref: C.R.P. No. 129 of 2010 SCJ.  
 
I have subsequently resigned on 19th October 2010 by 
letter addressed to the President of Pakistan and also 
informed the Pakistan Bar Council by the letter dated 27 
October 2010 .  
 
Copies of my resignation to the president of Pakistan and 
the letter to the Pakistan Bar Council are attached.  
 
I hope this clarifies the position that acceptance of 
resignation is not necessary in this case.”   
 
As has been observed in the case of Ha fiz Hamdullah V/s 
Saifullah Khan, Karachi PLD 2007 Supreme Court 52 at 
page 67: “The authority to whom the act of relinquishment 
is communicated is not required to take any action and the 
relinquishment takes effect from the date of such 
communication wher e the resignation is intended to 
operate in presenti.  
 
I hope this clarifies the position that acceptance of 
resignation is not necessary in this case.”    
 
3.   In the above background, we have pointed out to Mr. 
Kamal Azfar, learned Sr. ASC that in the l ight of the order dated 5th 
April, 2011 passed by one of us (Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ) in 
Chambers , his presence would be appreciated as being the lead 
counsel he has to appear in the Court. Therefore, no one else on his 
behalf can be allowed to argu e the case at this stage,  as in terms of 
Order XXVI rule 6  of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 , no unavoidable 
circumstances exist for exercising such power. Even otherwise,  as is 
apparent from the case s reported as Muhammad Younas v. State  (PLD 
2005 SC 93 ), Mukhtar Ahmad v. State  (PLD 2003 SC 126 ), Feroze Din 
v. Sardar Muhammad  (2002 SCMR 1993 ), H. Malik Amanullah v. 
Khyber Khan  (2008 SCMR 1723 ) as well as the recent order dated 1st 
April, 2011 passed in C ivil Review Petition No. 46 of 2011 in 
Constitution Pe tition No. 10 of 2011 etc., this Court has always 
discouraged substitution of counsel except in unavoidable 
circumstances,  therefore, permission to substitute counsel  at this CRP 129/201 0 etc. 
4 
stage , that too subject to law, cannot be granted. On this, he prayed 
for a short  adjournment to seek instructions. Accordingly, we re -
assembled at 11.30 a.m. He stated that some more time be given to 
him so that he may contact the competent authority. In the interest of 
justice, we adjourn this case for 12.04.2011.
