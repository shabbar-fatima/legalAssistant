convenience same are  also reproduced hereinbelow: - 
Final Conclusion and findings:  
 
(1) The Hon’ble Supreme Court appointed this Commission to probe, 
“to ascertain the origin, authenticity and purpose of creating / 
drafting of Memo for delivering it to Chairman of the Us Joint Chi efs 
of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.”  
(2) It has been incontrovertibly established that the Memorandum was 
authentic and Mr. Haqqani was the originator and architect of the 
Memorandum. Mr. Haqqani Sought American Help; he also wanted 
to create a niche for himsel f making himself forever indispensable 
to the Americans. He lost sight of the fact that he is a Pakistani 
Citizen and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States of America, 
and therefore his loyalty could only be to Pakistan.  
(3)  Mr. Haqqani’s by offering his  services as part of a proposed 
‘national security team’ to a foreign government, voicing the ‘great 
fears’ that ‘Pakistan’s nuclear assets are now legitimate t argets’ 
and thus seeking to bring ‘Pakistan’s nuc lear assets under a more 
verifiable, transparen t regime,’ stating that ISI maintains ‘relations 
to the Taliban’ and offering to ‘eliminate Section S of the ISI and to 
help ‘ pigeon – hole the forces lined up against your interests’ 
created fissures in the body politic and w ere acts of disloyalty to 
Pakistan, that contravened the Constitution of Pakistan.  
(4) The purpose of the Memorandum was to show that the civilian 
government was friends of America, but needed to be strengthened 
to prevail upon the army and the intelligence agencies, and to be 
able to do  so American help was required to set up a civilian 
national security team, to be headed by Mr. Haqqani.  
(5) There can be no two views that terrorism must be contested, 
terrorists fought, nuclear proliferation opposed, civilians (and not 
the military) determi ne foreign policy and the ship of State guided  5 
by civilian hands at the helm; however, what is not acceptable is 
for Pakistan’s Ambassador to beseech a foreign government to with 
impunity meddle in and run our affairs.  
(6) We may observe that Mr. Haqqani has c hosen not to live in 
Pakistan, has been working in USA, where he ap peared to have 
made his life, hel d no property or asset in Pakistan, held no money 
(save a paltry amount ) in a Pakistani bank, but despite having no 
obvious ties to Pakistan was appointed to the extremely sensitive 
position of Pakistan’s Ambassador to the USA, and in addition to 
being paid a salary and accompanying emoluments was handed a 
largesse of over an amount of two million dollars a year.  
 
4.   Needless to observe that Commission was constituted in 
pursuance of a judicial o rder passed by this  Court; its final conclusion 
and findings have also been read over by the learned Attorney 
General, therefore, formally we direct to make this report public.  
5.   As notices of the report have to  be issued to all the 
respondents, therefore, case is adjourned for a period of two weeks. 
Office is directed to prepare the extra copies of the report for 
supplying to the respondents as well as the learned Attorney Ge neral. 
However, the petitioners,  memb ers of the media and general public  
have to obtain copies of the same according to the Supreme Court 
Rules.  
6.   Prima facie it seems that Mr. Hussain Haqqani, former 
Ambassador of Pakistan in USA has to answer about the findings so 
recorded by the Commis sion. He was allowed to leave the country with 
the commitment vide order 30.1.2012 that whenever the Court 
requires, he will appear in person within a period of four days, 
therefore, we direct his presence on the next date of hearing, which 
shall be intima ted by the office according to the rules.   6 
7.   As far as remaining sealed envelopes containing 
documents, noted above, are concerned, same are ordered to be kept 
in the safe custody of the Registrar and any of them shall be open ed, if 
need be, during the proceedings of the case.
