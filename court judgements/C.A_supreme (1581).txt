O R D E R  
 For detailed reasons to be recorded later and subject to what 
is set out therein  by way of amplification or otherwise : 
1. The impugned order dated 22.03.2023  (“EC Order”)  made 
by the Election Commission of Pakistan (“Commission”) is 
decla red to be unconstitu tional, without lawful authority  
or jurisdiction , void ab -initio, of no legal effect and is 
hereby quashed.  Neither the Constitution nor the  law 
empo wers the Commission to extend the date of elections 
beyond the 90 days period  as provi ded in Article 224(2) of 
the Constitutio n.  
2. The Election Programme notified by the Commission 
under s. 57(2) of the Elections Act, 2017 on 08.03.2023 
(vide notification No. F.2(3)/2023 -Cord.) for the general  
election to the Punjab Assembly stands revived an d 
restored immediately with, however, certain 
modifications. The need for the modifications arises for 
the following reason. On 22.03.2023, when the EC Order 
was made matters had reached up to stage 5 of th e 
notified Election Programme. The EC Order unlawf ully 
purported to withdraw the Election Programme. Thus, the 
remaining stages (Nos. 6 to 11) could not be given effect  
to. In  the meanwhile 13 days have been lost on account of 
the unlawful order made by th e Commission. In 
consequence thereof, the remainin g stages have to be 
moved forward to take account of the lost period, and the 
Election Programme must be modified accordingly.  We 
come to this conclusion with reluctance but consider  it 
inevitable on accoun t of the situation brought about by 
the EC Order.  Therefore, the Election Programme will, in Const.P. 5 of 20 23 3
relation to stages No. 6 to 11, stand modified , and apply  
in the following manner:  
6. Last date for filing of appeals against 
decision of the Returning Officer 
rejecting/accepting the nomination 
papers  10.04.2023  
7. Last date for deciding of appeals by 
the Appellate Tribunal  17.04.2023  
8. Publication of revised list of 
candidates  18.04.2023  
9. Last date for  withdrawal of 
candidature and P ublication of 
revised li st of candidates  19.04.2023  
10. Allotment of Elect ion Symbol to 
contesting candidates  20.04.2023  
11. Polling day  14.05.2023.  
 
3. In consequence thereof, the polling day perforce must be 
shifted , and moved forward from 30.04.2023 to 
14.05.2023 . 
4. It is to be noted that on specific qu eries from the Court, 
the Commission categorically stated that if it was 
provided with necessa ry aid and assistance by the  
executive authorities in the F ederation and the Pro vinces 
in discharge of their constitutional obligations under 
Article 220, then the Commission , notwithsta nding 
everything set out in the recitals of the EC Order, would 
be able to organize and conduct  the general  election s to 
the Punjab and KP K Assemblies  honestly, justl y, fairly 
and in  accordance with law, as required in terms of 
Article 218( 3) of the Constit ution . Therefore,  the following 
further orders are made and directions given:  
5. The Federa l Government shall forthwith and in any case 
by 10.04.2023 release  and provide  to the Commission 
funds in the sum of Rs. 21 Billion for purposes of the 
general election s to the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
Assemblies. The Commission shall, by 11.04.2023, file a 
report in the Court stating whether the said funds have Const.P. 5 of 20 23 4
been provided and received and if so, whether in full or in 
part. The report shall be placed before the m embers of the 
Bench for consideration in Chambers. If  the funds have 
not been provided o r there is a shortfall, as the case may 
be, the Court may make such orders and give such 
directions as are deemed appropriate to such person or 
authority as necessary i n this regard.  The Commission 
shall be entitled to utilize the funds in the first instan ce 
for the purposes of the general election to the Punjab 
Assembly. If there is thereafter a shortfall for purposes of 
the general election to the KPK Assembly , the 
Commission may make an appropriate representation to 
this Court for such consideration and orders as deemed 
appropriate.   
6. The caretaker Cabinet that constitutes the Government of 
Punjab and, in particular, the Chief Secretary and the 
Inspector General Police of that Province must forthwith, 
and not later than 10.04.2023, provide a plan acceptabl e 
to the Commission for, inter alia, providing sufficient 
personnel for election -duty and security purposes for the 
holding of the general election. Furthermore, and in  any 
case, the Government of Punjab and all officials thereof 
must , in discharge of cons titutional and legal duties and 
responsibilities,  proactively provide all aid and assistance 
to the Commission for the holding and conduct of the 
general election .  
7. The Federal Government must, in exercise of its powers 
and position in terms of Article 243(1) of the Constitution, 
and all other constitutional and legal powers enabling it 
in that behalf,  and in discharge of its constitutional 
duties under Articles 148(3) a nd 220,  provide all such aid 
and assis tance to the Commission as required by it for 
the holding and conduct of the general elections to the 
Punjab and KPK Assemblies. Without prejudice to the 
generality of the foregoing, the Federal Government must 
make av ailable all necessary personnel, wheth er from the 
Armed Forces, Rangers, Frontier Constabulary and all Const.P. 5 of 20 23 5
other forces under the direct, indirect or ultimate 
command and control of the said Government, as are 
required by the Commission  for security and other 
purposes related to the general electi ons. In this regard, 
the Federal Government must forthwith, and not later 
than 17.04.2023, provide a plan acceptable to the 
Commission.  
8. If there is a failure by the Federal Government or the 
Caretaker Government in th e Punjab to provide aid and 
assistance to the Commission and, without prejudice  to 
the generality of the foregoing, in particular to comply 
with what  has been set out herein above, the Commission 
may make an appropriate representation to this Court for 
such consideration and orders as deemed appropriate.  
9. Our attention has been drawn to certain matters that 
were pending in this Court (being SMC 1/2023 and CP 
Nos. 1 and 2/2023) and which were heard and decided on 
01.03.2023 by a five member Bench of the Court b y a 
majority of 3:2 (Umar Ata Bandial, CJ and Munib Akhtar 
and Muhammad Ali Mazhar, JJ; Syed Mansoor Ali Shah 
and Jam al Khan Mandokhail, JJ dissenting). In 
particular, our attention has been drawn to the detailed 
reasons of the two learned Judges in minori ty (released 
on 27.03.2023) , wherein it is , inter alia,  stated that the 
said matters were decided (and dismissed) by a majority 
of 4:3. Respectfully, the position as claimed by the 
learned Judges in minority is erroneous and not 
sustainable in law.   
10. Our at tention has also been drawn to an order dated 
29.03.2023 made in SMC 4/2022 by a majority of 2:1 by 
a learned three m ember Bench (Qazi Faez Isa and 
Aminuddin Khan, JJ; Shahid Waheed, J dissenting). The 
hearing of the present matter remained, and its decisi on 
by this Bench is , wholly unaffected by any observations 
made in the aforesaid majority order .  
11. Insofar as the gene ral election to the KPK Assembly is 
concerned, in relation to which the present petitioners Const.P. 5 of 20 23 6
have also sought relief, learned counsel who en tered 
appearance on behalf of the Governor of KPK Province 
withdrew from such appearance on account of a certain 
stand taken by a political party which learned counsel 
was also representing. The Governor, KPK Province 
therefore ceased to have representatio n before the Court. 
In such circumstances, the matter relating to the KPK 
Province is not adjudicated upon, with perm ission 
granted to the petitioners to file such petition and/or seek 
such relief before such forum as is deemed appropriate.
