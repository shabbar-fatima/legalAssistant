"2.  In the normal course, such a request is entertained and allowed,  but in 
this case the Registrar of this Court has received a letter thro ugh fax.
Attention of the learned counsel has been drawn towards the cont ents of the
said letter and is ordered to be kept on record. Although wherea bouts of the
person, who sent this letter to the Registrar have not been ment ioned, but
when we have enquired from Brigadier Faheem, Force Commander,Rawalpindi, to highlight about the instant case, he stated that this matter
pertains to the grant of quota of Ephedrine to two Companies nam ely M/s
Berlex Lab International, Multan and Danas Pharmaceuticals Priva te Limited
against the rules as both the companies got allotted 6500 KGs an d 2500
KGs Ephedrine, respectively, whereas under the rules a quota mor e than
500 KGs Ephedrine cannot be allocated. Further it has been point ed out that
quota can be allotted to those Pharmaceuticals Companies, who ar e
manufacturing the medicines in which Ephedrine as one of ingredi ents is to
be used,  but the aforesaid Companies instead have sold Ephedrin e, which
is also known as poorman Cocaine, to the local manufacturers and  unknown
persons and earned profit. It has been added that investigation was
conducted and case has been challaned against 10 persons namely M/s
Iftikhar Ahmed Khan Babar; Rashid Jumma; Rizwan Ullah Khan;
Ehsan-ur-Rehman; Tanvir Hassan Sherazi; Chaudhry Abdul Waheed; A nsar
Farooq Chaudhry; Col.(R) Tahir-ul-Wadood Lahoti; Muhammad Hashim

"3. According to the Force Commander, there are few other persons, s ome 
of them succeeded in getting bail before arrest. It has also bee n also
informed that in the month of January, 2011 a question in this r egard was
raised in National Assembly and Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Federal Mi nister
for Health, made a statement for conducting investigation/inquir y and
accordingly a committee was constituted, which had submitted its  report, but
this report has not so far been brought on record of the Nationa l Assembly.
Meanwhile, Secretary, Narcotics  Control, vide letter dated 14.0 2.2012,
concluded that no direct evidence about the misuse of quota by t he said
Firms have been established/found in the above mentioned reports , which
reports according to the Force Commander were fictitious and got  prepared
by the Health Department, therefore, he did not agree with the s ame and
resisted by sending a letter to the Secretary on 22.02.2012. The  Secretary on
having seen the reaction from the Force Commander ultimately wro te a letter
on 22.03.2012 stating therein that evidence, if any, against the  applicant
(Tauqir Ali Khan son of Shaukat Ali Khan) or the political figur e in the subjectmatter may be brought into the notice of the Secretary and prior  approval of
the Secretary may be obtained for further prosecution of the app licant and
said political figure. 
4.   It is to be noted that the Investigating Officer Abid Zulfiqar, Deputy 
Director, ANF, issued a notice to Ali Musa Gillani on 12.03.2012  for recording
of his evidence, as according to him, material has come on recor d that
Touqeer Ali Khan used to claim himself to be the Private Secreta ry of Ali
Musa Gillani. We are of the opinion that reference of the politi cal figure in the
letter of the Secretary is of Ali Musa Gillani. However, on havi ng taken into
consideration the importance of the case, we are not inclined to  grant
permission to the learned counsel to withdraw the petition and t he
petitioner-department is directed to place on record all the rel evant
documents i.e. copies of the inquiry conducted by a team constit uted by the
Health Minister; copies of the reports, which were got prepared by the
Secretary of Narcotics Control; copies of the challans and FIR a s well as
summons issued; and copies of the letters of the Secretary, date d
14.02.2012; 22.02.2012; and 22.03.2012. The Force Commander,
Rawalpindi, is also required to place on record complete history  of the case
alongwith supporting documents on the next date of hearing. Mean while,
without prejudice to the petition which has been filed by the AN F, the
investigation as well as trial of the accused persons shall cont inue
independently."

"AFFIDAVIT "
I, Brigadier Fahim Ahmed Khan S/O Muhammad Yasin Khan Sherwani, force Commander,
Anti Narcotics Force, Regional Directorate, Rawalpindi, do hereb y solemnly affirm on oath
that;
1.ANF has registered FIR No. 40/2011 dated 10.10.2011 in PS ANF Rawalpindi.
2. IO of the afore-mentioned case has sent notices and letters to M r. Khushnood Akhtar 
Lashari (Ex Secretary Health) presently working as Principal Sec retary to Prime Minister
Mr. Yousaf Raza Gillani/Secretary Establishment Division, for re cording of his statement.
3. In response to the afore-mentioned notices, I along with Lt. Col  Syed Touqir Abbas Zaidi 
(Joint Director ANF) and IO Abid Zulfiqar (Deputy Director ANF) went to the office of Mr.
Khushnood Akhtar  Lashari, in PM House on 24th March, 2010 and, on the desire of M r. 
Khushnood Akhtar Lashari and his assurance to bring the real fac ts to light, I  had a
separate meeting with him in his office, where he discussed/conv eyed the following to me
in a maligning and threatening manner, because he being one of t he Prime
(abettor/associate/facilitator) in the case wanted to make full use of his present
appointment/office to suppress/distort/misdirect investigation a gainst himself and Ali Musa
Gillani:-" Mr. Khushnood Akhtar Lashari said that father of Ali Musa Gillan i is very   
upset and worried due to the summon issued to him.
" He said that if ANF focuses on two Pharmaceutical companies only  and 
spare others, ANF will be fully supported; Both companies will b e ruined and
State Machinery will be with you………
" He said that, you know, civil military relates have recently imp roved………
" H said that all depends on you (Brigadier Fahim) you can only sa ve from 
chaos and upheavals…….
" He further said in a sarcastic manner and meaningful expression that ANF 
is being commanded and controlled by army officers……..
" He asked to spare Ali Musa Gillani, his  
 will be done. This is a matte of National Interest.
 
4. In this regard, since then, may prejudiced, unfair and unwarrant ed actions 
have been taken by different state departments which confirms th e practical
manifestation of above mentioned threats and his heinous/malicio us design
to sabotage the investigation by one way or the other. 
Whatever I have stated above is true to the best of my knowledge  and belief
and nothing has been concealed therein.
