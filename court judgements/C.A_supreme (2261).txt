   Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. -Habib Ullah  Jan and 
Asif Ullah Khan  are amongst the accused  arrayed in a case of 
murderous assault , lodged by Saad Ullah PW . It is alleged that on the 
eventful day , differently armed, they assaulted Kaleem Ullah, Saad 
Ullah and Riffat Ullah , in consequence whereof, each sustained 
multiple injuries , confirmed by  medico legal reports . An outstanding 
dispute over a piece of land  triggered the episode .  
2.  Having regard to the magnitude of violence endured by the 
witnesses , no less than three in number , prima facie , supported by 
medical evidence , statements of the witnesses and spot recoveries , the 
High Court having found reasonable  grounds , standing in impediment 
to petitioners’ release on bail in the absence of any consideration calling 
for further probe so as to circumvent statutory bar embodied in section 
497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , declined the request ,  
a concl usion  arrived at  in its discretion  and, on our own analysis,  
found by us  as intra vires  being judicially structured , no interference is 
called for . Petition fails. Leave declined.
