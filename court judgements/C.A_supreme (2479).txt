On Courtâ€™s Notice:    
For Punjab Bar Council:   Mr. Khalid Umar, Assistant Secretary/Law Officer

     Malik Haider Zaman Advocate.

          ORDER   
 
 Jawwad S. Khawaja, J.  This order follows from our previous order dated 26.2.2014. 
Today Malik Haider Zaman Advocate has appeared alongw ith Mian Israr -ul-Haq, ASC. 
Mian Israr -ul-Haq states inter alia, that the respondent would like to submit an 
unconditional apology and for this purpose has already apologized  to the Presiding Officer 
of the learned trial Court and to the Judicial Officer who is her husband. However, he also 
added that Malik Hai der Zaman Advocate was unwell on 21.7.2012 when his alleged 
misbehaviour with the Court was noted in the order sheet of that Court.  
2. We hav e clarified to Mian  Israr -ul-Haq, ASC and Malik Haider Zaman Advocate 
that the later  should not feel pressured or obliged to tender an apology because his legal 
right to due process will be ensured even if he decides to put up a defence instead of 
submitting an ap ology.  Mian Israr -ul-Haq ASC acknowledged that our legal system could 
not function if due respect was not shown to presiding o fficers of Trial and Appellate 
Courts.  
3. Nevertheless Malik Haider Zaman Advocate is allowed two weeks within which he 
may file his concise statement and/or apology as he may chose. Relist thereafter.
