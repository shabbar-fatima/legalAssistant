ORDER  
  The representatives of the banks , who were required to 
appear , are present . They state that the amounts contained  in the report 
of the Commission are correct and they endorse the same. However, in 
order to find out how many out of the 222 cases of  
persons/organization s/compan ies which were recommended by the 
Commission to be fit for further investigation , are interested in exercising  
option No.1  mentioned in our previou s order (s), a meeting was convened 
under our orders . We have been informed that at present,  only 26  out of 
the 222 borrowers are interested in exercising  option  No.1 (a list whereof has 
been placed on the record as mark ‘A’) . We have however been apprised that some 
other borrowers may also be interested  in availing the first option.  
Therefore , some more time may be granted to enable them to decide 
whether or not they wish to exercise option No.1. Accordingly, we grant 
one final opportunity to all those who wish to exercise option No.1  to 
apprise this Court of their final decision within 10 days’ from today .  
 
2.  It may be clarified that  on the next date of hearing , we will 
consider the possibility of modifying the other two option s to the extent 
that the outstanding amounts , as determined by the C ommission , along 
with markup there on, may be treated as decree s passed by C ourts of 
competent jurisdiction . The amounts found payable by the Commission 
considering that the same were unlawfully got written off may be 
recovered from the borrowers as arrears of land revenue from the SMC No. 26/2007 etc.  7
entities, the original borrowers and the guarantors . Such decree shall 
also be enforceable  against  mortgage d properties.  
 
3.  The borrowers who intend to make deposit s pursuant to 
option N o.1 must do so through pay orders/c heques to be deposited with 
the Registrar of this Court . He shall open a separate account for the said 
purpose and deposit the amount (s) therein. This order shall be publicized 
via press release in the print and electroni c media.  
  To come up on 16.8.2018 .
