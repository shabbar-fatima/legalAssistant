Jawwad S. Khawaja, J.
– The accountability of an elected  government under our 
constitutional dispensation , is the bedrock of democrati c governance. There are a number 
of aspects of accountability of the elected executive both at the federal and provincial 
levels. Amongst the most important of these elements is the assurance  that the finances of 
the government shall be properly utilized i n accordance with and in furtherance of the 
objectives set out in the Constitution and in statutes enacted by Parliament ( Majlis -e-
Shoora ) and the provincial legislatures . 
2. In our Constitution, there is little room for a laissez faire model of governance . The 
government is required to perform numerous functions aimed at the welfare of the people Const. P. 105/12 etc.  2 
of Pakistan. To fulfill such functions revenues have to be generated. The recent federal 
budget for the financial year 2013 -14 envisages revenue generation a mount ing to 
Rs.3420/ - billion . Additionally, there are bodies established by or under statutes which at 
times generate their own  revenues but hav e been established, mandated or controlled by 
the government . Such bodies perform functions which have been consider ed sufficiently 
important by the Government, to justify legislation, control or funding. These bodies  are 
required to ensure transparency  in their accounting and financial affairs  because of being  
in the public domain  and because they are instrumentalities  of the government, 
established to further the objectives for which they are created . For the purpose of 
ensuring that the revenues generated by the federal and provincial governments through 
taxes , levies , impositions  and loans etc . and the financial affa irs of statutory/autonomous 
bodies  are monitored appropriately for compliance with the Constitution and applicable 
laws, the important constitutional office of the  Auditor General of Pakistan has been 
established. The Auditor General of Pakistan and the Ac countant General of Pakistan 
Revenues (AGPR) perform constitutional and statutory duties as will be discussed 
shortly, with the prime objective of reporting to the people of Pakistan through their 
chosen representatives, that revenues of statutory/autonomo us bodies referred to above 
and the revenues of the State, the principal component whereof comes from the pockets of 
the pe ople of Pakistan, have been expe nded in accordance with the Constitution and 
statutes.  
3. The accountability of governments and thos e who hold high office in government 
thus represents the very foundation for the levy and legitimacy of taxes etc. In any 
civilized system of governance , age-old principles of financial accountability have been 
recognized and the most important of these ar e not open to question any more. Thus we 
have the seventh century instance of Hazrat  Umar  (May Allah be pleased with him) the 
second Caliph of the nascent Islamic State , who  set a precedent for us, many centuries 
before the public scrutiny of state funds b ecame an institutionalized norm all over the 
world .  Among the spoils of war that were distributed  amongst the victorious army  one 
day, was some cloth out of which each soldier  had one piece . Soon thereafter,  Hazrat  
Umar got up to speak and said, “ Lower yo ur voices so that you may hear me .” Hazrat Umar 
was a tall and well -built man, and it was clear that what he was wearing  comprised not Const. P. 105/12 etc.  3 
one but  two pieces of that  recently -distributed  cloth. Salman (one of the citizens present) 
broke out saying , “By God, we  will not hear you, because you prefer yourself to your people .” 
“How is that ”” asked Hazrat Umar. Salman said: “ You are wearing two pieces of cloth while 
everyone else is wearing only one .” Hazrat Umar called out  to his son Abdullah who 
confirmed that the  second piece of cloth was his share of the bounty  which he had gifted 
to his worthy father . Having thus brought the truth of the matter out, Salman said  “Now 
we shall hear you .” (Narrated in, amongst other sources , I’lam al -muwaqqi’in by Ibn al -
Qayyam al -Jawziyyah) . It is through such levels of financial probity and pubic 
accountability that governments exercising authority in the name of the People, derive 
legitimacy. With the evolution of the State into its present day manifestation, public 
accountabilit y is done through a constitutionally tenured sentinel such as the Auditor 
General envisioned in our Constitution. Similar institutional watchdogs  have been 
provided for in the Constitutions of responsible and accountable  democracies the world 
over.   
4. This brings us to consideration of the matter which we propose to decide through 
this order. Constitution Petition No. 105 of 2 012 was filed by two journalists namely, 
Hamid Mir and Absar Alam Haider. They were later joined by some other journalists. 
During t he course of the hearing of the said Constitution Petition, a number of issues 
arose relating to the media. The petition was primarily focused on the media , and the use 
of public  funds for the purpose of influencing the media was one such issue. Vide order  
passed by us on 15.1.2013, a two -Member Commission (Media Commission) was 
appointed f or the purpose of making a report  on nine  Terms of Reference. These Terms of 
Reference have been set out in the aforesaid order of 15.1.2013. The Media Commission 
has sub mitted its report on the Terms of Reference ; comments/objections thereon have 
been sought from interested partie s. Vide order dated 26.6.2013 , this specific matter 
relating to the audit of accounts generally and more specifically the existence  and 
utilizat ion of secret service funds by various Ministries, has been taken up separately.  
The question of the constitutional validity of establishing and maintaining accounts which 
are kept secret and are not being subjected to audit by the office of the Auditor G eneral of 
Pakistan, has thus  come to the fore.  Const. P. 105/12 etc.  4 
5. There is a fundamental premise, relating to disclosure/audit, on which allocation 
of such funds and their spending is to be judged. Article 19A of the Constitution 
stipulates in very clear terms that “ever y citizen shall have the right to have access to 
information in all matters of public importance, subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions 
imposed by law”.   There is no contention between the parties that information relating to 
money spent from t he public exchequer is a matter of public importance. Article 19 of the 
Constitution  which is also relevant, inter alia , guarantees “freedom of the press, subject to any 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law” . Such reasonable restriction can only relate t o and be 
imposed “in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or 
friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contemp t 
of Court, [commission of] or incitement to an  offence” . The fundamental premise to be kept in 
mind, is that all funds in the State exchequer are funds which have come out of the 
pockets of the people of Pakistan.  These funds are the product of the toil, sweat, tears and 
blood of the people. The Gove rnment is at most a trustee and custodian of these funds 
and is accountable for the expenditure of these funds in a fiduciary capacity as envisioned 
in the Constitution. The only exception against public disclosure is given in Articles 19 
and 19A of the Co nstitution referred to above. Even where the government or the 
legislature choose to regulate or impose restrictions upon disclosure of use of funds, such 
restrictions cannot be arbitrary but have to be reasonable. As to what is or what is not 
reasonable i s a matter of which the government is not the sole arbiter. It is constrained by 
the Constitution and by law. Any restriction on disclosure of expenses made from the 
exchequer, which the government imposes, or the legislature provides for, would be 
justice able on the touchstone of Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution  and inter alia,  of 
Articles 168 to 171 which relate to audit of the accounts of the Federation and the 
Provinces  “and the accounts of any authority or body established by or under the contro l of the 
Federal or Provincial government …” .   
6. It is in this context that at least since September, 2012, we have repeatedly been 
asking the Government to state its basis to justify non -disclosure and non -audit of 
expenses from the public exchequer . It is most unfortunate that despite our repeated 
directions and orders , up until 08.07.2013  nothing material was brought to our attention  to 
justify the exclusion from audit of some disbursements . In our order dated 13.9.2012, we Const. P. 105/12 etc.  5 
had directed the respondent Ministry to “set out in detail the budget allocation for the financial 
years ending 30.6.2010, 30.6.2011, 30.6.2012 and 30.6.2013 alongwith supplementary grants” . 
We had further required the Ministry to furnish details of the budget allocation s and 
supplem entary grants for these years along  with the report of the Auditor General of 
Pakistan in respect of the said budget allocations. On 18.10.2012, learned counsel 
representing the respondent Ministry stated that there were only three heads of account 
in resp ect of which a privilege against disclosure was being claimed namely, (a) Special 
Publicity Fund, (b) Secret Service Expenditure and (c) the Institute of Regional Studies. A 
relatively small amount totaling Rs.14,00,00,000/ - (rupees fourteen crores) approx imately 
was mentioned as the sum expended from these accounts. It was asserted on behalf of the 
Ministry that the Secret Service Fund is meant for “sensitive assignments ” and  that it is 
“judiciously utilized ”, the way  “all the previous governments in the p ast” have utilized it. On 
these grounds, it was asserted by the Ministry that “ [t]he details of spending of amounts 
specified as secret fund in the budget cannot be divulged to the petitioners as the same are differe nt 
from other public funds which are ope n to scrutiny and audit .” It was also argued that  “[t]he 
secret fund is administered in the national interest  and for the advancement of government policies 
planned for such an avowed end… The Parliament in its wisdom has allocated /passed such fund 
for ach ieving certain policy objectives of the Government…. ” (C.M.A 4461/2012) . And later, in 
C.M.A. 1972/2013 filed on behalf of the Ministry on 9.04.2013, it was argued that 
“[p]rotecting valuable state information is part and parcel of a state’s national secur ity. The 
concept of national security is defined by the online edition of the MacMillan Dictionary as, “the 
protection or the safety of a country’s secrets and its citizens.”  The order which was passed by 
us on 20.12.2012 is of relevance to the question pr esently being considered by us. The 
issue is as to whether “the federal budgets have allocated from time to time to the federal 
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting any funds that may be spent in its discretion or that 
may be spent in secrecy without d isclosing the purpose of the disbursements or the identity of its 
recipients? If so did the said Ministry have a constitutional basis for such disbursements?”  It was 
clarified by us that in line with the provisions of Articles 19A and 19 of the Constitutio n, 
we were not inclined to accept the contention of the Ministry that use and expenditure of 
these funds could be kept secret  or un -audited . We also observed and recorded that 
“[p]rima facie, while the Ministry may claim privilege from making public disclo sure of certain Const. P. 105/12 etc.  6 
parts of its budget, such privilege is not automatically available to the Government. It must be 
claimed from the Court. Information for which secrecy is sought must be clearly marked and the 
reasons for seeking secrecy must also be clearly  stated. The Court can then make a determination 
on this point in line with the law and the Constitution ”. 
7. In the same order we noted the submissions of Mr. Asad Kharal, a journalist, who 
has been impleaded as a petitioner, that “the budgets of 27 other  Ministries also contain secret 
funds similar to the ones which are in place in the Ministry of Information” . It now seems clear 
that using the legal cover purportedly provided by General Financial Rule  37, “Secret 
Service Funds ” were indeed created in the  budgets of various ministries, purporting to 
shield the spending from the scrutiny of the Auditor -General.  According to the Director 
General Federal Audit, the amount of budgetary allocations not being submitte d for audit 
was in excess of Rs.3.57 billion  in the previous budget . This sum is apart from the 
revenues of the statutory/autonomous bodies that are resisting audit by the Auditor 
General. This is  a disturbing matter since alleged secret funds and un -audited expenses 
can potentially be a tool for un dermining the rights of citizens protected under Articles 19 
and 19A of the Constitution and may  also encourage waste and corruption. It may also 
usefully be noted that in our three orders dated 25.04.2013, 02.05.2013 & 06.05.2013, we 
have again and again emphasized to the Government that without a lawful justification, 
there cannot be a denial of disclosure or withholding of accounts from the Auditor 
General  for audit . Numerous opportunities were given to the  then  Attorney General but 
as noted, he was not able to render any assistance whatsoever or to give any meaningful 
response to the simple question raised by us.  During the pendency of this case,  however,  
a new government was sworn in . Since a substantial question of interpretation of  the 
Constitution is  involved, n otice under Order XXVIIA CPC was given to t he new  Attorney 
General Mr. Munir A. Malik . In what may be termed a significant  shift, during the 
hearing on 08.07.13, the  Attorney General took the  categorical position that all 
expenditure from gover nment funds  is auditable by the Auditor General  of Pakistan  and 
that there were no exceptions to this  rule. This stance of the learned Attorney General 
closely resonates with the above -mentioned orders and with the submissions of the 
parties advanced befor e us. Const. P. 105/12 etc.  7 
8. In response to the Court’s queries,  the Auditor General also submitted a list of 19 
organizations which refuse to have their accounts audited by the Auditor -General, 
contending , inter alia,  that they are independent of the Federal  Government  and d onot 
receive budgetary allocations . The Auditor General has expressed his opinion that these 
organizations fall within the ambit of Articles 169 and 170 of the Constitution and, 
therefore, are required to submit their finances for audit by the Auditor Gene ral. These 
bodies  have been listed in our order of 06.06.13 as follows: - 
1. Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (Finance Division)  
2. People’s Primary Health Initiative (PPHI) Provincial Support Unit, KPK  
3. Trust for voluntary organization (TVO) (Econom ic Affairs Division)  
4. National Police Foundation (Ministry of Interior)  
5. National Database & Registration Authority (NADRA) M/o Interior  
6. Wah Nobel Private Ltd. M/o Defence Production  
7. Agri Business Support Fund (Ministry of Food Security and Research)  
8. Pakist an Ordinance Factories Welfare Trust Fund (Ministry of Defence 
Production)  
9. Punjab Rural Support Programme  
10. Punjab Land Development Company  
11. Punjab Power Development Company  
12. Punjab Industrial Estate  
13. Punjab Coal Mine Company  
14. Punjab Agriculture & Meat Company  
15. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. 
(M/o Information Technology)  
16. Pak China Investment Company (Finance Division)  
17. Defence Housing Authority (M/o Defence)  
18. Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)  
19. Trust for Voluntary  Organizations  (TVO) . 
 
This immunity claimed agai nst audit by the Auditor -General  appears to be un -justified in 
the light of the text of Article 170(2) . Notices have , therefore,  been issued to these 
institutions and the matter shall be decided after giving an opportunity of  hearing to 
them . 
9. In light o f the aforementioned Orders and related oral and written subm issions by 
the parties and amicus  curiae, the following issues arise  before us for adjudication : 
(1)  Does the Constitution permit any exception – for secret services or 
otherwise - to the Audito r General’s duty under Articles 169 and 
170 of the Constitution to audit the accounts of the Federation, the 
Provinces and authorities and bodies established by or under the 
control of the Federal or a Provincial Government? If not, what is 
the constitutio nal status of sub -Rule (5) of Rule 37 of General 
Financial Rules of the Federal Government which purports to 
exclude secret service expenditure from the purview of the 
constitutionally mandated audit?  
(2) Does the Constitution permit the executive branch o f the 
government to prescribe accounting principles and procedures for 
itself without the consent of the Auditor General?  
(3) With respect to secret service expenditure, does the Constitution 
permit any exception or restriction, under Article 171, to the 
Auditor General’s duty to submit his audit reports on federal and 
provincial accounts to the President or a Governor, respectively, or Const. P. 105/12 etc.  8 
to the latter’s duty to cause such reports to be laid before the 
Parliament or a Provincial Assembly, respectively? How do es the 
fundamental right to information enshrined in Article 19A of the 
Constitution affect the answer to this question, if at all?  
 
We may now address these issues.  
ISSUE 1 : THE SCOPE OF AUDITOR -GENERAL’S CONSTITUTIOANAL MANDATE 
AND THE PURPORTED EXCLUSI ON OF SECRET SERVICE FUNDS  FROM AUDIT . 
 
  
10. The answer to this question is given with reasonable  clarity by the express words 
of sub -Article (2) of Article 170 of the Constitution . It states  that “the audit of the accounts  of 
the Federal and of the Provi ncial Governments and the accounts of any authority or body 
established by, or under the control of, the Federal or a Provincial Government shall be conducted 
by the Audi tor-General , who shall determine the extent and nature of such audit .” The broad 
scope  and wide significance of this article  has been noted in our Order dated 07.05.2013: 
“The Constitution does not recognize any exception to the provisions of Article 170(2)... In this 
view of the matter, the Consolidated Fund and Public Accounts cannot rema in unaudited” (para 
11). Even before the introduction of Article 170(2) in 2010, the Auditor General’s 
(Functions, Powers and Terms & Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001, made it 
“abundantly clear that where the amount is charged on the Consolidated Fun d or relates to the 
Public Accounts of the Federation or the Provinces, the same must be audited by the Auditor -
General without exception”  (Order dated 07.05.2013, para 11) . Also in our  Order of 
07.05.2013, (para 13 ), we noted that: “sub -Article (2) of Art icle 170 of the Constitution was 
added by the 18th Amendment which amply empowers and directs the Auditor General to fulfil his 
constitutional obligations as watchdog of the people of Pakistan. It is only through audit that it c an 
be ensured that the hard earned income of citizens of this country is being spent for lawful 
purposes. Without the audit specified by the Constitution and the two statutes, referred to 
hereinabove, there can be little or no room for any transparency. Absence of audit by the Audito r 
General, apart from being violative of the Constitution and law, is a sure and certain invitation to  
corruption and lack of accountability.”   
Here we may add, by way of background, that from 1952 to 1973, the controlling statute 
in this field was Pakista n (Audit and Accounts) Order, 1952. It was replaced by Pakistan 
(Audit and Accounts) Order, 1973 which held the field until the 2001 Ordinance repealed 
it. In both of these earlier statutes, “accounts of the Federation relating to Defense or Railways”  Const. P. 105/12 etc.  9 
were  explicitly removed from the pale of the Auditor General’s audit, although these 
could be included at the Governor -General’s or President’s discretion. The 20 01 
Ordinance removed these exceptions and expanded the scope of the audit. The 18th 
Amendment has now put this expanded scope on constitutional footing.  
11. The comments of the Auditor General filed later on 27.05.2013 through CMA 
3471/2013 confirm that “all expenditure from and receipts payable into the Consolidated Fund 
and Public Account of the Fede ration and of each Province, and receipts payable into the account of 
each District” were already subject to audit under Sections 8 and 12 of the Auditor 
General’s (Functions, Powers and Terms and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001. 
According to the Au ditor General: “The objective and rational [e] to include Sub Article (2) in 
Article 170 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was that some organizations 
which were self -revenue generating would refuse audit by the Auditor General of Paki stan on the 
grounds that they did not receive any budgetary support from the government, despite the fact that 
such organizations were owned by the government after having been established either through an 
Act or Ordinance. Certain organizations that have  been setup/established through seed money 
provided by the government also fell under the same category. Therefore, all such authorities, 
bodies and organizations are subject to audit by the Auditor General of Pakistan after the 
incorporation of Article 17 0(2) in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.” The 
Auditor General has supplied the names  of 19 public organizations, reproduced above, 
that have been refusing audit even after the introduction of Article 170(2)  in the 
Constitution .   
12. The Government’s only argument in favour of an exemption for secret service 
expenditure from audit wa s based on sub -Rule (5) of Rule 37 of the General Financial 
Rules  (GFR) . As noted , prima facie, in our Order dated 07.05.2013, sub -Rule (5) of Rule 37 
of GF R is in violation of not just the Auditor General’s (Functions, Powers and Terms and 
Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001 but also of Article 170(2) of the Constitution.  The 
learned Attorney General, in his submissions on 8.7.2013 (discussed above) has a lso taken 
the same position.      
 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE LEGAL REGIME GOVERNING SECRET 
FUNDS  
 Const. P. 105/12 etc.  10
13. Before rendering our opinion  on this question , we find it necessary to consider the 
historical aspect of th e issue . Since Article 170(2) was introduced into the Constitution as 
recently as 2010 and the Auditor General’s (Functions, Powers and Terms and Conditions 
of Service) Ordinance was promulgated in 2001,  it will serve a useful purpose to try and 
determine the basis and origin of the General Financial  Rules (GFR) and to try and 
ascertain  under what constitutional or statutory authority Rule 37 of the GFR was 
prescribed .   
14. In our Order dated 07.05.2013, we have already noted our disappointment at the 
Government’s inability to provide us the authorit y or legal instrument that originally 
sanctioned the creation of secret service funds and its peculiar accounting and audit 
treatment. In C.M.A 4461/2012 filed on behalf of the Ministry of Information, conflicting 
answers were given . At one point in  the “b rief” annexed to this C.M.A , it was surmised 
that “ [t]the Secret Service Fund was established since long, most probably in the 70s ”, yet a  few 
pages down, in the very same document, it was stated that “ this fund has existed since 1947 -
50 onwards …” Our rese arch staff have however been able to locate some  information in 
the public domain for us to shed some light  on the query raised in the preceding  
paragraph.  The “brief” submitted on behalf of the Government suggests that the secret 
service fund may very wel l have existed since 1947, and even before that . It seems 
appropriate therefore to refer to the laws of colonial and post independence India and  of 
England to ascertain the origin and history of secret service funds.   
15. In the case of India, documents g enerally available in the public domai n do not 
make the matter entirely  clear but are sufficient for the purpose of the inquiry at hand. We 
may begin with the Indian General Financial Rules, 2005, iss ued by the Ministry of 
Finance,  Department of Expenditur e available online  which bear remarkable similarity in 
terms of concept and terminology, to the GFR – the similarity is traceable to pre -1947 
colonial rule.  Then we may refer to the “Manual of Central Audit”, 2010 edition, issued by 
the Principle Accountan t General for the Indian State of Kerala, which has its paragraph 
8.6 titled as “Secret Service Expenditure” and notes, among other things: “The accounts of 
secret service expenditure are not subject to scrutiny by this office. The expenditure should 
norma lly be admitted in audit on the strength of the certificates obtained from the competent 
authorities. Such expenditure incurred by each officer provided with funds for the purpose is Const. P. 105/12 etc.  11
audited by departmental officer nominated by Government who furnishes the  audit certificate to 
the Accountant General (A&E).”  (Available online).    
16. The next document we may refer to is an “Office Memorandum” issued by the 
Indian Ministry of Finance , Department of Expenditure, F.No.6(1)/E.II -A/2010, dated 16 
February 2010, r efers to “Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs’ OM No. 
2(121) -B/54 on 1st January, 1956 and OM No.3(67) -B/69 dated 11th September, 1969... regarding 
re-appropriation of funds to augment the provision for Secret Service Expenditure (SSE).”  Lastly, 
we may advert  to the “Report of the Task Force for Review of General Financial Rules, 
1963”, dated July 2004  (available online) , which notes at paragraph 2 on page 1 that “The 
General Financial Rules were first issued in 1947 by consolidating in one place the provisions of 
the Book of Financial Powers, the Civil Accounts Code and other orders and instructions of a 
general financial nature which were in force prior to Independence ”. This factual statement can 
be taken as sufficient confirmation of the pre-Independence origins of the GFR 
particularly in the absence of any other explanation forthcoming from the government.  
These  Indian references show that secret service funds currently exist in India at the 
central as well as state level ; that these  are subject to an “administrative audit” by a 
“nominated Controlling Officer” who issues an audit certificate in this regard ; that secret 
service funds have existed in India at least since 1947 , and that India inherited secret 
service funds, as Pakistan appear s to have, as a remnant of the British colonial 
administration.  
17. The status  of secret service funds in the case of the United Kingdom is much 
clearer than in India and Pakistan. We may begin by noting the statement made by Mr. 
Robin F. Cook (a governmen t/cabinet Minister) in the House of Commons on 11 
December 1979 for his motion “[t]hat leave be given to bring in a Bill to give legal authority for 
the creation of a security service, and to provide for the appointment of its Director -General and for 
his accountability to Parliament; and for connected purposes ”. The statement is particularly 
insightful and is recorded in Hansard as follows: “It is a remarkable fact that there is no Act 
on the statute book that provides the Government with the legal authori ty to raise and maintain a 
Security Service. I can go further than that.  I have had the Library check through the statute book 
and it has come up with only one statute that even acknowledges the existence of the Security 
Service —namely, the  Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782.  Section 24 of that far -seeing Const. P. 105/12 etc.  12
piece of legislation provides:  for preventing as much as may be all abuses…it shall not be lawful to 
issue for the purpose of secret service within this kingdom, any sums of money which in the wh ole 
shall exceed ten thousand pounds in any one year.  That prompts the unhappy thought that not 
only is there no legal authority for the existence of the Security Service but that for the best par t of 
the past 200 years the funds released to it from the Tr easury have been wholly illegal.  The statute 
to which I have referred was not repealed until 1977,when the funds released for the Security 
Service exceeded not only £10,000 but £10 million. The effect of repeal was to expunge from the 
statute book the one solitary recognition that the  Security Service exists. That is plainly 
unsatisfactory. ” (emphasis added)  
18. With reference to accounting and audit, section 27 of the Civil List and Secret 
Service Money Act 1782 provided that: “Whenever it shall be necessa ry for the principal 
Secretary or Secretaries of State, or First Commissioner of Admiralty, to make payment of any 
money issued for foreign secret service, or for secret service in detecting, preventing, or defeatin g 
treasonable or other dangerous conspira cies against the state, in any place within this kingdom, 
then it shall be sufficient to acquit and discharge the said secretary or secretaries  … in the office to 
which such secret service money hath been paid  … to take oath …  in the form following : - ‘I, A.B., 
do swear, that the money paid to me for foreign secret service, or for secret service, in detecting,  
preventing, or defeating treasonable, or other dangerous conspiracies against the State (mutatis 
mutandis, as the case may be), has been bona fide a pplied to the said purpose or purposes, and to no 
other; and that it hath not appeared to me convenient to the State that the same should be paid 
abroad’” . The striking resemblance which section 27 ibid and the certificate therein, have to 
GFR 37, suggests  very strongly that GFR 37 borrowed its concept and language from the 
above referred Act of 1782.                
19. The later developments in the UK with regard to audit of secret service 
expenditures may be gleaned from the Report by the UK Comptroller an d Auditor 
General (C&AG), dated 18 February 2000  (available online) . In this report, at para 7, the 
C&AG notes that: “[t]he purchases [etc] … for the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence 
Service took place at a time when the existence of the Secret  Intelligence Service was not officially 
acknowledged. At that time the Secret Services Vote [that is, the budgetary allocation made by the 
Parliament], which provided for the salaries and expenses of the Security Service and the Secret 
Intelligence Servic e, was not subject to my audit. I relied solely on certificates provided by Const. P. 105/12 etc.  13
ministers  under an arrangement agreed by the Committee of Public Accounts in the last century 
(1887 Report (HC 201) paragraphs 35 -36). Since 1947, however, expenditure on stores an d capital 
items, unless of an especially secret nature, had been met from votes open to my inspection, as 
recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts (4th Report 1945 -46 (HC 172), paragraph 26).  
In practice, this was from votes maintained by the Foreig n and Commonwealth Office and the 
Ministry of Defence and the civil estate votes ”.  
20. A report published in 1996 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), titled “Audit of Secret and Politically Sensitive Subjects, 
Comparative Audit Practices”  (available online)  notes that: “ Until 1994 the [UK] C&AG 
had full access to all government expenditure except the expenditure of the Security Service and the  
Secret Intelligence Service. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) decided in 1879 that any 
services of a confidential nature should be charged to the Secret Service Vote and the C&AG was 
not expected to audit this vote . As the C&AG had to provide an audit opinion on all budget votes 
the secret vote was covered by a special certificate, which read[:] ‘I certify that the amounts shown 
in the above account to have been expended (and received) are supported by certificates from the 
responsible Ministers of the Crown’” (page 11) . 
21. The UK officially acknowledged the existence of its secret services and put them 
on a statutory footing through the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services 
Act 1994. The C&AG’s Report notes at para 8 that: “before the latter Bill was introduced, the 
Prime Minister told the House (Official Report, W ritten Answers, 24 November 1993, col 52) that 
he intended that all the expenditure of the Intelligence Agencies … would be fully open to my 
scrutiny, apart from limited restrictions to protect the identities of certain sources of informatio n 
and the detai ls of particularly sensitive operations “. It may, at this point, be noted that in the 
UK there is no constitutional provision comparable to Article 19A or Articles 169 to 171 of 
our Constitution. As a result it is for the Auditor General to undertake an au dit of the 
Consolidated Fund and the Public Accounts of the federation and of the provinces  
without being dependent on the government or the legislature for this purpose . 
22. In the light of the above discussion, the following observations may be made  
abou t the origin and history of “secret service funds ” and their accounts/audit treatment :  
i. The Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 was the only law in the 
UK dealing with the secret service or its funding until the enactment of the 
Security Service A ct, 1989;  Const. P. 105/12 etc.  14
ii. The dispensation under the said Act of 1782 with respect to audit of secret 
service funds was, for all practical purposes, the same as the dispensation 
prevailing in British India prior to 1947 and in Pakistan and India since 
Independence – that is, the Auditor G eneral’s mandate did not allow for an 
audit of such funds by him.  
iii. Pakistan currently does not have and never has had any law dealing with 
secret service expenditure except Rule 37 of the GFR.   
 
23. It may be concluded then, with sufficie nt certainty, that the practice in Pakistan , of 
supplying an oath/certificate to the auditor general to account for secret service 
expenditure was imported from the UK during colonial times (though it is not clear if this 
was done directly under the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 or otherwise) 
and continued after Independence through orders in the form of the GFRs  which donot 
have statutory backing in the context of our Constitution, even if these rules could have 
been justified under the Gove rnment of India Act 1935 or in subsequent e nactments  or 
Constitutional dispensations prior to the 18th Amendment in 2010 . While this historical 
analysis highlights, in general, the need for maintenance and public availability of official 
historical records  for effective understanding of contemporary issues of governance, it 
also highlights the p otential need for the government to put its secret services on a 
statutory footing for a more effective democratic control over their budgets, expenditures 
and activ ities.  
24. Although it is not a  factor  which is directly relevant in deciding the matter at 
hand, it  may be useful to note that  the UK is not the only country in the world where state 
auditors have full access to the accounts of the secret services. The O ECD report, supra , 
notes that while restrictions may apply as to the number of staff permitted for audit, there 
is no restriction on the audit coverage of secret funds in France, Germany and the 
Netherlands. Even in a security state such as Israel, which h as one of the most notorious 
intelligence operations and agencies in the world, accounts of secret services are not 
beyond the mandate of the state auditor. “Studies in State Audit” is a document 
published by the Israeli Comptroller’s Office in 1995, and i t notes, (page 111 ), that the 
State Comptroller has access to “ even the most secret information ” and “ audits the activities of 
the Mossad and the Shin Bet  [Israeli secret services]  as well .” (available online).        
25. One last aspect of Issue 1 that nee ds to be addressed is the need to maintain 
secrecy of  certain government activities in the national interest. Article 19A envisages 
“reasonable restrictions imposed by law”, on the right to information guaranteed to citizens, Const. P. 105/12 etc.  15
by the Constitution. It is, th erefore, for the legislature to make a law in this behalf if it so 
chooses. The legislature can benefit from the experience of other countries such as, those 
examined in the  OECD report, supra . In France, for instance, the funding for secret 
services origi nating from the Prime Minister’s Office is audited by a special committee of 
two members of the state audit institution, Cour des Compets, and one representative of the 
Ministry of Finance. Similarly, in Germany, “The secret and special purpose fund of the  
Foreign Ministry and the discretionary fund of the Federal Chancellor are audited by the 
BRH President in persona ” (BRH stands for Bundesrechnungshof , the supreme federal audit 
authority). In light of this comparative analysis, the recommendations of the  OECD report 
may be useful. We may, however, add the caveat that any legislation or policy in this  
regard will have to be complaint  with the provisions, inter alia, of Articles 19, 19A, and 169 
to 171 of the Constitution.  
26. Here  it is necessary to recogn ize and highlight the distinction be tween  “secrecy” 
on the one hand and “audit” on the other. Even prior to the passing of the 18th 
Amendment in 2010 , accounts of the various Ministries which had been labeled as 
“secret” were subjected to audit but such au dit was undertaken by a designated 
controlling officer and not by the Auditor General of Pakistan. This situation is no longer 
permissible in view of the material changes which have been brought about in the 
Constitution inter alia, by virtue of Article 19 A and Articles 169 to 171 of the Constitution. 
Thus post 2010, all disbursements made from the Public Accounts or from the 
Consolidated Fund whether as a charge on the fund or by way of grants therefrom, are 
mandatorily required to be audited by the Audito r General of Pakistan. The demands of 
secrecy in respect of some grants and allocations can be met inter alia, through 
mechanisms and procedures ensuring secrecy but without any exception or exemption 
from audit by the Auditor General of Pakistan. It may b e reiterated that the amounts 
currently being labeled as “secret service expenditure ” by the various Ministries  have 
always been subjected to audit  under procedures envisioned by GRF 37. As such the 
distinction between audit and secrecy is fully understood  and recognized by the 
Government itself. The material change which has come about in the Constitution 
through the 18th Amendment is that the audit by law and the Constitution has now to be Const. P. 105/12 etc.  16
undertaken by the Auditor General and not by government functionar ies designated as 
controlling officers.  
27. In light of  the discussion above, we hold, declare and direct that :- 
a)  sub-Rule (5) of Rule 37 of the General Financial Rules, whereby the 
actual accounts for secret service expenditure are taken beyond the 
jurisdiction of the Auditor General, is illegal, unconstitutional, and 
of no legal effect;  
b) the Auditor General, in order for him to fulfil his duties under 
Articles 169 and 170 of the Constitution, is not only authorized but 
also obliged to seek access to  any and all records actually 
maintained by all federal and provincial governments, as well as all 
entities established by or under the control of the federal and 
provincial gove rnment, regardless of the designation  of such 
records as secret or otherwise;  
c) an account subject to audit under Articles 169 and 170 shall be 
treated as “secret” only if so labelled in a federal or provincial 
statute  and the constitutionality of such legislation will be subject to 
judicial review on the touchstone of Articles 19 A, 169, 171 and other 
relevant provisions of the Constitution ; and  
d) the Auditor General shall  prescribe procedures that permit audit of 
accounts labelled as “secret” but do not compromise the secrecy of 
such accounts. The Auditor General s hall have [ 4] months to 
establish  such procedures.          
 
 
ISSUE   2: THE AUDIT OR-GENERAL AS THE REGULATOR OF PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS . 
 
28. This issue arises from sub -Rules (1) to (4) of Rule 37 of GFR whereby special 
methods of keeping accounts and rendering them  to the Auditor General have been 
prescribed. For the sake of convenience these sub -Rules are reproduced below:  
“37. Secret Service Expenditure.  
(1)  When an allotment is placed at the disposal of an officer for secret services the 
officer concerned will m aintain a contingent register  in the prescribed form in 
which the date and amount of each contingent bill will be entered with a note of the 
progressive expenditure. Within the allotment the officer may draw bills for such 
sums as may be necessary. Such bi lls will not be supported by vouchers.  
(2) The general control of expenditure incurred against the allotment will be vested 
in the officer aforesaid, who will be responsible that accounts are duly maintained 
and that payments have been properly made for th e purpose for which the 
appropriation has been made.  
(3) The officer aforesaid will maintain in the form of a cash book  a secret record of 
the expenditure and receipts (if any) connected with the allotment. This record 
should contain the amount and the dat e of each payment and such indication of its 
nature as the officer mentioned in para. (4) below may consider necessary in order 
to enable him to discharge the responsibility placed upon him by that para. The 
amounts drawn from the treasury on contingent bi lls will be entered in the cash 
book on the receipt side the number and date of the bill being noted against the 
entry.  
(4) In respect of each officer authorised to incur secret service expenditure, 
Government will nominate a Controlling officer who should  conduct at least once 
in every Financial year, a sufficiently real administrative audit of the expenditure 
incurred and furnish a certificate to the Accountant -General in the following form 
not later than the 30th November following the year to which it r elates: -  Const. P. 105/12 etc.  17
 
“I hereby certify that the amount actually expended by me or under my 
authority for secret service in the year ending the 30th of June, was Rs. ----, 
that the balance in hand on the said 30th of June, was Rs. ---, and that this 
balance was surr endered by short drawing in the first bill presented 
during the year, and I declare that the interests of the public service 
required that the above payments should be made out of secret service 
funds and that they were properly so made.” (emphasis added)  
 
29. It may be noted at the outset that, as a consequence of the decision on Issue 1  
above, sub-Rule (4) is rendered redundant from the point of view of the Auditor General , 
Therefore,  regardless of compliance with sub -Rule (4), the Auditor General shall h ave 
access to the “contingent register”, the “cash book” and any other record maintained 
under sub -Rules (1) to (3). However, for the sake of further clarity , it is hereby declared 
that it shall be violative of the Constitution  to rely on sub -Rule (4) to p revent the Auditor 
General’s access to accounts maintained under sub -Rules (1) to (3) of Rule 37 of GFR. 
Similarly, since the Auditor General’s duty under Article 170(2) pertains to audit of 
“accounts ” instead of secondary documents such as the “certificat e” to be issued under 
sub-Rule (4), he is not to place exclusive reliance on such certificates for the purposes of 
audit. The Government shall however remain free to use such internal controls as it 
deems appropriate, including the administrative audit pre scribed under sub -Rule (4)  in 
addition to audit by the Auditor General .    
30. As for the method of accounting prescribed under sub -Rules (1) to (3), it may be 
useful to refer to Article 170(1) of the Constitution and Section 5(a) of t he Controller 
General  of Accounts (Appointment, Functions and Powers) Ordinance, 2001, which are 
reproduced as under:    
Constitution: Article 170. Power of Auditor -General to give Directions as to 
Accounts  
(1) The accounts of the Federation and of the Provinces shall be kept i n such form 
and in accordance with such principles and methods as the Auditor -General may, 
with the approval of the President, prescribe.  
The Controller General of Accounts (Appointment, Functions and Powers) 
Ordinance, 2001: Section 5. Functions of the Co ntroller General: - 
The functions of the Controller General shall be:  Const. P. 105/12 etc.  18
(a) to prepare and maintain the accounts of the Federation, the Provinces and 
district governments in such forms and in accordance with such methods and 
principles as the Auditor General may, with the approval of the President, 
prescribe from time to time;  
31. Since the “certificates” issued under sub -Rule (4) have long shielded the accounts 
of secret service expenditure from the Auditor General, it is safe to assume that the 
Auditor Gener al has never had a chance to consider the propriety or effectiveness of the 
accounting procedures prescribed under sub -Rules (1) to (3) of Rule 37. However, the 
above constitutional and statutory provisions make it clear that the Auditor General has 
the po wer to prescribe accounting practices which are different from the ones already 
prescribed under sub -Rules (1) to (3) of Rule 37 of GFR.  
     
ISSUE  3:  SCOPE OF THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF AUDIT INFORMATION . 
 
32. The need to retain secrecy of certain govern ment activities may be necessary,  
especially when the subject is labelled as “secret” by the elected representatives of the 
people in the federal or provincial assemblies. We have already noted, with regard to 
Issue 1, the need to maintain the secrecy of s uch subject during the audit process. 
Naturally, the same consideration also extends to the distribution of reports to be made 
by the Auditor General. Article 171 of the Constitution pertains to the reports of  the 
Auditor General and provides as under:      
Article 171. Reports of Auditor General  
The reports of the Auditor -General relating to the accounts of the Federation shall 
be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before the [both 
Houses of Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) and the rep orts of the Auditor -General 
relating to the accounts of a Province shall be submitted to the Governor of the 
Province, who shall cause them to be laid before the Provincial Assembly.  
33. Article 171 leaves no room for doubt that reports of the Auditor Gene ral shall have 
to be submitted in all events to the President, or the Governor of a Province, as the case 
may be  to be placed before the chosen representatives of the people elected to the Federal 
and Provincial legislatures . In any event, since the Presid ent and Provincial Governors are 
heads of the federal and provincial executive s, it is only appropriate that they should have Const. P. 105/12 etc.  19
complete knowledge of the audit of secret services under their charge. Moreover, there is 
little reason to doubt the ability of su ch highly placed and responsible offices to retain 
state secrets. However, it can be that secrecy of audit reports of secret services may be 
endangered if these reports are too widely circulated because this may result in 
multiplying the number of persons and thus, opportunities for diluting the secrecy of the 
reports.  The express words of Article 171 also cannot be lost sight of. The Article does 
require the audit reports to be shared with the elected representatives of the people. This 
situation may call for a reporting procedure , which does not compromise the need for 
secrecy  but which also fulfils the constitutional imperative of ensuring audit of all funds 
disbursed from the public exchequer .  
34. The present discussion raises issues  of first impression  in Pakistan therefore it 
appears  appropriate to examine the experience of other countries where similar issues 
may have been encountered. Since some of these countries have addressed these issues  
through executive or legislative action , Courts have not be en called upon to adjudicate the 
matter to test the constitutionality of executive/legislative measures. Moreover, we have 
not come across  even one constitution amongst  member countries  of the UN , which 
guarantees the right to information in the broad term s set out in Article 19A of our 
Constitution . The report of the Comp troller and Auditor General  of the UK , supra,  notes 
that: “In January 1987, the then Chairman of the Committee (Official Report, 27 January 1987, 
cols 246 -249) told the House of Commons ab out the Committee's arrangements for dealing with 
highly classified material . At another point, at para 9, the report states: “The arrangements 
[that provide me full access to the records of secret services] also prevent me from divulging the 
information I  have obtained  …”. 
35. In Germany, the audit findings concerning secret service expenditure are “only 
reported to the same confidential budget committee [of the Parliament comprising five members], 
the ministry responsible for the service and the ministry of finance”  (OECD report, supra,  page 
10). The audit finding concerning the secret and special purpose fund of the Foreign 
Ministry and the discretionary fund of the Federal Chancellor may be communicated 
“only to the presidents of the two chambers of Parl iament, to the Federal Chancellor and the 
Federal Minister of Finance”  (ibid). In the Netherlands, “Each budget heading that is labelled as Const. P. 105/12 etc.  20
secret has to be audited by the ARK President in persona [ARK stands for Algemene Rekenkamer, 
which is a High Counci l of State with 3 members] .         
36. From the above discussion, the distinction between “audit” and “secrecy” is made 
clear. It would be for the Auditor General to ensure the audit of each rupee spent from the 
Consolidated Fund and the Public Accounts, without exception. Parliament may make a 
law imposing “reasonable restrictions” on public disclosure of such parts of the Auditor 
General’s Report as may be classified. Such law, needless to say, will need to pass muster 
under the Constitution.  
37. Notice s have been issued to the 19 Institutions mentioned in para 8 above, t o 
justify their claim that their  finances/accounts are not subject to audit by the Auditor 
General. This matter  relating to the aforesaid 19 bodies has been  listed for hearing on 
22.7.20 13.   
38. Before parting with this opinion, we would like to record our appreciation for Kh. 
Haris Ahmed, Sr. ASC, as amicus curiae .
