   Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. —This petition has 
been filed against the judgment da ted 5.6.2006 passed by Lahore High 
Court, Rawalpindi Bench.  
2.   Learned counsel stated that in view of the judgment in the 
case of Federation of Pakistan th rough Secretary Education Vs. Pr.Dr. 
Anwar and two others (2006 SCMR 382) the pe titioner is entitled for 
hearing before the competent authority  by way of submitti ng his reply. In 
this behalf it may be noted that a larger Bench of this Court earlier 
delivered a judgment  in the case of Federation of Pakistan Vs. Muhammad 
Tariq Pirzada and two others  (1999 SCMR 2744) a nd settled that hearing 
before Section Officer is sufficien t. Relying upon the same judgment, 
learned High Court had obs erved that hearing before Section Officer will 
meet the requirements of Article 32 Order PO(1) 1983.  2.   We are inclined to agree with the judgment delivered by a 
larger Bench comparing the judgment which has been relied upon by the CP 788 of 2006  2
learned counsel, therefore, the earlier view taken in Tariq Pirzada’s 
case(ibid) is approved and petition is dismissed holding that the High 
Court had rightly declined to interfere in the impugned order following the 
law laid down in the judg ment delivered by a larger Bench of this Court. 
   Petition is dismisse d and leave declined.
