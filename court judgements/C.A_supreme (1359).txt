ORDER  
 
       Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J.  Declined by the High 
Court of Sindh, the petitioners seek bail in anticipation to their 
arrest  in NAB Reference No. 1 of 2019 , filed in pursuance to direction  
dated 20 -1-2016  by the High Court of Sindh  to initiate an inquiry/ 
probe  into the alleged misappropriation of funds in execution of 
Annual Development Plan  of Irrigation (E&W) Khairpur for the year s 
2013 -14, 2014 -15. It turned out that except for some par tial work, 
no work was executed at all ; loss to the exchequer was calculated as 
Rs.8,93,03,470. 
2.  Sher Muhammad, Ayyaz Ahmed Somro , Ali Gul Phul l and 
Ghulam Nabi are officials of the Irrigation Department whereas Meer 
Muhammad, Sodoro , Ghulam Sarwar  and Tariq Hussain, being 
contractor s, have been  arrayed for their connivance in the scam  to 
defeat the exchequer .  
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioners  are in a unison; the ir 
arguments include  execution/completion of projects as per  codal  
requirements ; according to them, it is evident from the 
survey/inspection report  itself. The bottom line is that the projects 
were executed in the year 2014 and, thus, there was no occasion 
down the road in the year 2018, that too, in the month of August 
when the canal  ran in full swing, to physically detect any 
flaw/deficiency in the executed work. Mr. Muhammad Munir 
Paracha , ASC went a step further to argue that his client never 
applied for the project and was instead unsuspectingly 
impersonated by some one else; accor ding to him,  no amount ever 
landed in his  account  and was, thus, blameless ; malafide  is lurking 
behind the intended arrest, concluded the learned counsel with one 
voice.  The learned Law Officer has faithfully contested the pleas  by 
arguing that there was a mple technical and documentary evidence 
to inescapably frame the petitioners with the charge ; he has prayed 
for dismissal of the petitions.  
4.  Heard.  Record perused.  
5.  It was on a complaint alleging violation of rules as well as 
embezzlement in the project that the High Court  of Sindh directed a 
probe , on the basis whereof, physical verification by the experts 
found non -execution of various planks of the project as well as 
partial completion of the work, found  much less than the required Civil Petition Nos.4029, 4070, 4092, 4110, 4111, 4112 & 4131 of 2019  
 3
standard s. In this backdrop, malafide  cannot be conceivably 
attributed to the initiation of proc eedings against the petitioners, in 
absence whereof, they cannot claim judicial protection in a 
prosecution  that otherwise sans relief of bail. While refusing bail to 
the petitioners, the learned High Court has directed the 
Accountability Court to conclude the trial within a period of three 
months requiring the accused to cooperate in the conclusion thereof , 
an option to conveniently vindicate their position sooner rather than 
later.  
  Grant of pre -arrest bail is an extraordinary remedy , 
essentially rooted into equity, a judicial power to be cautiously  
exercised  with a view to protect the innocent from the horrors of 
abuse of process of law , in prosecutions initiated by considerations  
and for purposes  stained with the taints of malafide ; this judicial 
protection is not to be extended in every run of the mill criminal 
case, with pleas structured on bald denia ls and parallel stories . View 
taken by the learned High Court being well within the remit of law 
does not call for interference. Petitions fail . Dismissed. Leave 
refused.
