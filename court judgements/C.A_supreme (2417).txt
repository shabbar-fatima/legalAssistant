  JUDGMENT  
  SAYYED MAZAHAR ALI AKBAR NAQVI , J:- The 
petitioner has sought leave to appeal under Article 185(3) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 against the 
judgment of Lahore High Court, Lahore dated 08.11.2017 in 
Murder Reference No. 199/2015/ Criminal Appeal No.328 -J/2015.  
2.  The petitioner was arrayed one of the accused in case 
FIR No.693/ 2011 dated 15.11.2011 offence under section 
302/324/337 -F(i), 337 -F(vi)/34 PPC registered with Police Station 
Sharakpur District Sheikhupura lodged at the instance of one Criminal Petitions1298 & 1612  of 201 7 -:2:-
Mehboob Alam. The complainant of this case being aggrieved by 
the conduct of local police investigation agency preferred to file 
“complaint ” in the court of Learned Sessions Judge, Sheikhupura 
titled as “ Mehboob Alam vs, Muhammad Asif and others ” under 
section 302/324/34/337 -F(i) PPC on 11.01.2012. The learned trial 
court proceed ed with the “complaint ” in the spirit of the law laid 
down by the superior court and as such the charge was framed 
vide order dated 22.05.2012. The learned trial court after 
completion of the trial came to the conclusion that the prosecution 
has succeeded to prove the case against Muhammad Asif for the 
commission of Qatl -i-Amd of Tanvir Ayyub hence, he was ordered 
to be convicted under section 302(b) PPC and was sentenced to 
death. He was further directed to pay compensation of 
Rs.2,00,000/ - to the legal heirs of the deceased under section  
544-A Cr.PC. He was further to undergo S .I for six months in case 
of default. The judgment of the learned trial court was assailed 
before Lahore High Court, Lahore through Criminal Appeal 
No.328 -J/2015  (Muhammad Asif vs, the State ), Murder Reference 
No.199/2015  was also sent  to the court under section 374  Cr.PC 
for its confirmation . Both the matters were adjudicated and 
decided by the Learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court, 
Lahore vide judgment dated 08.11.2017. The learned Division 
Bench after taking into consideration all the facts and 
circumstances decided the matter while converting sentence to 
death into imprisonment for life with reasons assigned qua 
quantum of sentence hence, the instant petition before us.  Criminal Petitions1298 & 1612  of 201 7 -:3:-
3.  At the very outset, it has been argued by the learned  
counsel for the petitioner that in fact, it is a case of no evidence. 
The learned courts below had not tak en into consideration the 
evidence available on record and the same has not been 
appreciated according to the principle of “ appreciation of evidence ” 
enunciated by the superior courts from time to time. Contends that 
though in the FIR against the column date and time of occurrence, 
it has been mentioned  as 15.11.2011  ﺷﺎم وﯾﻼ  but the same is not 
part of the statement made by the complainant at the time  of 
chalking of the FIR, that even the “ complaint ” lodged by the 
complainant just after lapse of three months  of registration of 
crime report , also not mentioned the date and time of occurrence. 
Further contends that the postmortem in this case was delayed  by 
twelve to twenty four hours which further lend support to the fact 
that it was unseen occurrence and whole proceeding s were carried 
out at a belated stage after due deliberation. Contends that the 
statement of the prosecution witnesses of the ocular ac count is at 
variance and if the same is tak en into consideration , it do not 
inspire confidence to sustain conviction in case of capital charge. 
Contends that the ocular account is also in contradiction to the 
medical evidence which further lend support to the stance taken 
by the defence that none of the witness was present at the spot 
and it was an unseen occurrence and the petitioner was involved 
because of previous animosity. Lastly it was argued by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner that the salutary  principle of “benefit of 
doubt ” was not extended in favour of the petitioner and as such it 
is a fit case for interference by this Court in the interest of justice .  Criminal Petitions1298 & 1612  of 201 7 -:4:-
4.  On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on 
behalf of the complainant argued that  the Learned High Court has 
erred while altering the sentence to death into imprisonment for 
life. Contends that it was preplanned murder, normal sentence 
provided under statute is death  but the learned High Court has 
extended artificial reasoning while co nverting the sentence of death 
into imprisonment for life. Contends that the judgment of the 
learned trial court is not sustainable in the eyes of law.  The 
learned law office r has also adopted the contention raised by the 
learned counsel for the complainan t.  
5.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and 
gone through the record with their able assistance.  
6.  There is no second cavil to this proposition that 
initially the matter was lodged with the local police for initiation of 
proceedings against  the accused persons nominated in the crime 
report but within a period of three months the complainant lost 
confidence in the fairness  of the investigation and as such 
preferred to file “ complaint ” before the learned trial court. Though , 
the complainant ha s mentioned in his “complaint ” that the accused 
persons nominated in the crime report are men of mean s having 
politic al interference and there is no  scope of fair investigation but 
this aspect was not elaborated with any particular instance. As far 
as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that 
particularly the time of occurrence has not been mentioned while 
lodging the “complaint ” and it was not even part of the record at the 
time of making statement  before the court .  Criminal Petitions1298 & 1612  of 201 7 -:5:-
7.  Bare perusal of the crime report which was lodged 
with promptitude reflect the date and time of occurrence against 
the specific column which is part of the form  has been duly 
mentioned . Hence, the contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that it is unseen occurrence has lost its probative value 
hence, the same is repelled. Another aspect of the case that the 
postmortem in this case was delayed by twelve to twenty four 
hours was taken into consideration by us. In the instant case, one 
person lost his life, while there were two injured persons , those 
were evacuated to Mayo Hospital from the place of occurrence 
which is at a distance of 30/40 KM . Possibility  of consuming the 
time in transportation might lead to delay in postmortem 
examination  which was still fairly good as the doctor has opined 
proximately that it ranges from twelve  to twenty four hours. In a 
country where the medical facility cum availability of paramedics 
for the job assigned is not an easy task, the consumption of such a 
time seems to be qu ite  reasonable hence, the prosecution evidence 
cannot be brush ed aside on this score alone to extend the benefit 
of doubt  as claimed . We have  also noticed that there is previous 
hostility between the parties , hence it too does not inspire 
confidence and the same is repelled. We have noticed that the 
learned High Court while converting sentence to death into 
imprisonment for life has assigned justifiable  reasoning supported 
by facts and law hence, the same seems to be well reasoned and 
meet all the standards of safe administration of criminal justice.  
8.  In view of the facts and circumstances narrated above 
and the reasons assigned, we do not f ind any scope for interference Criminal Petitions1298 & 1612  of 201 7 -:6:-
into judgment of the learned High Court hence, the instant petition 
before us is dismissed . The conviction and sentence inflicted upon 
by the learned High Court is upheld. As a consequence, leave to 
appeal is refused.
