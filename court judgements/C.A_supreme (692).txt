Yahya Afridi,  J. For the reasons already recorded in my 
judgment delivered in Constitution Petition No.17 of 2019, t he 
present Civil Miscellaneous Application No.1243 of 2021 is 
dismissed, as the relief sought by the petitioner would “negate 
the very spirit of t he oath taken by the petitioning Judge”.    
2.  However, for the reasons to be recorded later, I 
find the right of the public to have access to live -streaming or 
audio -video recording,  written transcript or any other 
medium, of the court hearings in the proceeding s of public 
importance, including  those under Articles 184(3) and 186 of 
the Constitution, is their fundamental right under Article 19A 
of the Constitution.  The Registrar of this Court is, therefore, 
directed to place the matter before the Full C ourt for 
appropriate steps as it deems fit , under Article 191 of the 
Constitution,  to effectuate this fundamental right of the 
public.

Short Order  
 For the reasons to be recorded later, we dispose of  the 
miscellaneous application (CMA No.1243/2021) filed by the Petitioner in review 
petition (CRP No.296/2020) in the following terms:  
(i)  Article 19 -A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (“Constitution”) creates an obligation on  State institutions, 
including the Judiciary, to take the necessary measures to ensure 
realization of the fundamental right of citizens to have access to 
information in matters of public importance. Cases under Article 184(3) 
of the Constitution, including  review petitions and other matters arising 
therein, are matters of public importance, and the public has a right to 
know and see how proceedings in these cases are conducted and 
concluded by the Court. We, therefore, hold that Live Streaming  (audio 
and vi deo) of court hearings of these cases should be made available for 
information of the public through a link on the official website of this 
Court, and for this purpose the Registrar of this Court should take steps 
to provide for the requisite technological  infrastructure and make 
arrangements for necessary amendment s in the Rules under Article 191 
of the Constitution to regulate its practice and procedure in this regard;  
(ii) Keeping in view the current state of technological infrastructure 
available in this Cou rt and the fact that the review petitions filed in the 
case are fixed for hearing, we direct the audio recording of the 
proceedings of the court hearings of the said review petitions to be made 
available to the public through a link on the official website  of this 
Court. The Registrar of this Court shall ensure that the un -edited audio 
recording of the proceedings of the court hearing of the review petitions 
is made available to the public on the official website of the Court on the 
same day soon after the hearing and before the close of the working 
hours.
