ORDER  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Petitioner was 
admitted  to bail in anticipation to his arrest in a NAB reference  by the 
High Court of Sindh way back in the year 2017 , however,  the 
protection was recalled vide  impugned order dated 09.10.2020 by the 
High Court on his having obstinately obstructed the conclusion of trial, 
otherwise at its fag -end. The learned Judges also noted  with disdain  
petitioner’s  unbecoming  attitude towards the learned Presiding Judge 
of the Accountability Court, a young lady,  attempting conscientiously 
to proceed  with the trial. Petitioner’s appalling conduct  as reported by 
the learned Judge  has appropriately been visited  by the learned Judges 
of Hi gh Court of Sindh as he deserved  no less . Petition fails. Leave is 
declined . The  petitioner is directed to su rrender himself before the law; Criminal Petition No. 2661  of 2020  2
in the event of default, he shall be taken into custody so as to face the 
trial.
