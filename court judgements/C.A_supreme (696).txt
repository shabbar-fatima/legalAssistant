DATE O F 
HEARING  ORDER OF HON’BLE CHIEF JUSTICE  
10.04.2023  
For the applicant(s)/appellant(s)  
Mr. Mansoor Usman Awan, Attorney General for Pakistan  
Ch. Aamir Rehman, Addl. AG  
 
    . . . . . . . . 
   Through the se 18 C ivil Misc. Applications  the 
appellants  seek the withdraw al of the ir curative  review  
petition s filed against the  Supreme  Court’s (“the Court ”) 
decision dated 26.04.202 1 given i n its review jurisdic tion in 
Justic e Qazi Faez Isa  Vs. President of Pakistan  (PLD 20 22 
SC 119 ) (“Subject  Judgment ”).  
2.  The facts giving rise to the present withdraw al 
applications are that by a majority  of 6-4 the Court vide the 
Subject  Judgment allowed the r eview petitions filed by Mr. 
Justice Qazi Fa ez Isa  and other  parties  against the decision  
of th e Court  dated 19.06. 2020  delivered  in Justice Qazi 
Faez I sa Vs. Pr esident of Pakistan  (PLD 2021 SC 1 ) 
(“original judgment ”). As a result,  certain direc tions issue d 
to the Federa l Board  of Reve nue and the Supreme Judicial 
Council  by the original judgment  were recalled . Aggrie ved by 
the Subject Judgment , the appellant s preferred  curative 
review petition s befor e the Court  on 25.05.2021 .  
3.  The Institut ion Officer  raised certain objections  on the  
filing of the  curative review petitions . The main  objection  
urged  was that  the purpose behind  seeking a  curative revie w 
is to avail a second review which is not enterta inable  under 
Order XXVI, Rule 9 of the Supreme Court R ules, 1980 
(“1980 Rules ”). In respon se to the objec tions, the appellant s 
filed chamber  appeal s under Order V , Rule  3 of the  1980  
Rules . During the pendency of these appeals  on 31.03.2023  
the President , whilst  acting on the advice of the Prime 
Minist er, granted  his author isation  to the concerned CMA NO. 2012 OF 2 023 ETC.  9
ASC/AOR for the w ithdrawa l of the  curative review petitions  
filed by the appellants . These withdrawal applicat ions are 
fixed for decision  in Chambers  today.  
4.  The learned Att orney General  for Pakistan  and t he 
learned Ad ditional Attorney General  for Pakis tan entered 
appear ance on be half o f the appellant s. The rationale  behind  
withdrawing the curative review petitions is  reflected in the  
Federal Cabinet ’s decision  dated 27.07.2022 . Essentially  the 
legal point s pressed are: 
i. That the 1980 R ules prohibit the filing of a second 
review petition  after the final dispo sal of the first 
review petition ; and 
ii. That the curative review petitions ha ve been filed on 
the strength  of a judgm ent delivered by the Indian 
Supreme Court  (“SCI”) in Rupa Ashok Hurra Vs. 
Ashok Hurra  (AIR 2002 SC 1 771) wherein the  SCI 
had explicitly recognise d its right  to ‘re-consider its 
judgments in exercise of its inherent power .’ However,  
no pronounceme nt to such effect  has been made by 
the Court . Hence,  the conc ept of a curative review 
petition is alien to the law s and j urisprudence  of 
Pakistan  and the refore these petitions  being not 
maint ainable are liable to be withdrawn.  
5. I have heard the learned Attorney General  and have  
also perused the re cord. The bar on filing a second  review 
petition  is declared in  the 1980 Rules  in the following words: 
“ORDER XXVI  
REVIEW  
... 
9. After the final disposal of t he first application 
for review no subsequent application  for review 
shall lie to the Court and consequently shall 
not be entertained by the Registr y.” 
This bar has also been affirmed by  a 5 Member Bench of  the 
Court in Khalid Iqbal Vs. Mirza Khan  (PLD 2015 SC 50 ) at 
para 12. Therefore , under the current scheme of the law  the 
appellant s appear to be precluded  from filing a review  
against  the Subject  Judgment  because it has finally CMA NO. 2012 OF 2 023 ETC.  10
disposed  of the review petition s filed against th e original 
judgment . 
6.  Be that as it may , the Court  in the past  has of its own 
motio n correct ed its decisions  wherein  wron g princ iples of 
law have been laid down . In this rega rd the dict um of the 
Court in the case of Khalid Iqbal  (supra) is illustrative:  
“13. This, however, do es not mean that the 
jurisdiction of this Court is barred by an y 
restriction placed by the Constitution; there is 
no Arti cle in the Constitution which imp oses 
any restriction o r bar on this Court to revisit its 
earlier decision or even to  depart from them,  
nor the doctrine of stare decisis will come in its 
way so long  as revisiting of the  judgment is 
warranted, in view of th e significant impact on 
the funda mental rights of citiz ens or in the 
interest of public good . This issue was fully 
compr ehended and ans wered in the case titled 
Regarding pensionary benefits of the 
Judges of Superior Cou rts from the Date of 
their respective  retirements, irrespective of 
their length of service as such Judges  (PLD 
2013 SC 829 at page 993) . The relevant 
portion s are reproduce d herein below :--…  
 
4. … Therefore, if any law which has been 
invalidly pronounced and declared by this 
Court , which in particular is based upon 
ignoranc e of any provisions of the Constitution, 
and/or is founded on gross and grave 
misinterp retation thereo f; the provisions of the 
relevant law have been ignored, misrea d and 
misapplied; the  law already enunciated and 
settled b y this Court on a specific subjec t, has 
not been taken into account, all this, inter alia, 
shall constitute a given judg ment(s) as per 
incuriam … Therefore, if a judgm ent or a 
decision of this Court which is found to be per 
incuriam … it shall be the duty of  this Court to 
correct such wrong  verdict and to set the law 
right. And the Court should not  shun from 
such a duty … 
 
On perusal of the paragraphs referred to 
hereinabove, we can safely reach a concl usion 
that this Court  has absolute powers to re -visit, 
to review and or to set aside its ea rlier 
judgments/orders by invoking its Suo Motu 
Jurisdiction under Articles 184(3), 187  or 188 
of the Constitution . The Powers of this Court to 
exercise its inherent  jurisdiction under t he 
above refer red Articles of the Con stitution are 
not depend [e]nt upo n an application of a 
party .” 
(emphasis supplied ) 
What  becomes  apparent  from the above-quoted passages  is 
that our jurisprudence  recognise s the Court ’s Suo Mot u 
jurisdiction under Article 184(3)  and Article  188 read with  
Article 187 of the Constitution  to re-visit, review  or set aside CMA NO. 2012 OF 2 023 ETC.  11
its judg ments/orders  that h ave finally disposed of the  first 
review petition s. However, such jurisdiction  has so far  not 
been invoked by the Court in t he present matter .  
7.  Insofar, as the principle of curative review petit ions is 
concerned , it is not  disputed by the appellants  that the 
existence of  this jurisd iction  has hithert o not  been 
considered  by the Court. In fact, a ll the judgmen ts cited by 
them in support of  their curative review petit ions reiterate  
what has been held above : that a second review is barred by 
law and that the Court  alone  is empowered, if so inclined, to 
re-visit, review  or set aside an y of its previous 
judgment s/orders.  
8.  Further  a study of the Indian law on curative r eview  
reveal s that it is a remedy  altogether distinct from the  Suo 
Motu exercise of jurisdiction  by the Court . Whereas c urative 
review has no standing in  our juris prudence  the availability 
of Suo Mo tu review  has long been accepted  by the Court , 
albeit  in the limited circumstances of doing complete justic e 
under Article  184(3) and /or Article  188 read with  Article  187 
of the Const itution . It is of course clear that both ty pes of 
judicial interven tions , curative review and Suo Motu review,  
possess a similar  purpose i.e.,  to correct a  fundamental  
error in a p revious judgment/o rder. However,  the key 
differe nce, inter alia , between the two jurisdictions lies 
mainly in their mode  and manner  of invocation . Order 
XLVIII, Rule 2 of the Supre me Court Rules , 2013 mandat es 
that c urative review  must  be invoked by a part y: 
“Order XLVIII  
CURATI VE PETITION  
… 
2. (1) The petitioner, in the curative  petition, 
shall aver spe cifically  that the grounds 
mentioned therein had been taken in the 
Review Petition and that it was dismisse d by 
circulation. ” 
(emphasis supplied ) CMA NO. 2012 OF 2 023 ETC.  12
On the oth er hand, Suo Motu review  can only be invoked by 
the Court in its discretion , including on the information  
received  from an aggrieved or concerne d party. Therefore , 
the lack of the proceedings  being initiated  by a party  is 
inconsequential to the Court ’s exe rcise of  Suo Motu  
jurisdiction . That does not app ear to be the case  for curative 
review petitions filed in the SCI.   
9.  In the present case  no Hon ’ble Mem ber of  the Bench  
that deli vered the Subject  Judgment  (nor any other Judge of 
the Court) h as so far  considered it necessary to re -visit, 
review or set aside th at judgment  on the ground that it  has 
had a significant im pact on the  Funda mental Right s of 
citizens ; or th at it is in the interest of the public good;  or 
that it is per incuriam . Consequently , in the  absence of such 
a judicial view and the lack of an enabling jurisdiction that 
allows a n aggrieved o r concerned  party to file a second 
review, the appellant s curative review petitions  appear to be 
not maint ainable .  
10.  In the  above  circu mstances the  ordin ary course of 
action would have been to refer the matter t o the Court for  a 
conclusive determination on its maintainabi lity. However,  
the appellant s are now seeking the withdrawal  of their 
curative review pe titions . This right of the appellant s to 
withdraw  their curative  review  petitions  (and generally of 
parties to withdraw th eir cases)  is acknowledged  by the law 
[ref: Reviews on behalf of Ju stice (R etd.) Abdul Ghani 
Sheikh  (PLD 2013 SC 1024 ]. Exceptions to the said  rule 
exist for instance public interest litigation  filed under Article 
184(3) of the Constitution cannot be withdrawn except with 
the permission of the Cou rt [ref: Jurists Foun dation Vs. 
Federal Governmen t (PLD 2020 SC 1) at para 6 ]. But that 
exception is not  applicab le to the instant  case becau se it is 
not litigation  in the public interest . Rather  the present CMA NO. 2012 OF 2 023 ETC.  13
matter  emanat es from Article 2 09 of the Co nstitution  which 
grants the Suprem e Judi cial Council , and not the Court,  the 
exclusive  power to inquire into the misconduct of a Superior 
Court Jud ge. Therefore, the appellant s retain  the 
unconditional right to withdraw the ir curative review 
petitions filed against the Subject  Judgment. This result is, 
however, without prejudice to what has been noted above , 
namely, that  the pendency of proceedings o r the presence of 
a party  is no t necessary for the Court to exercise Suo Motu 
jurisdiction . All that is required for the Court t o act is 
cogniz able i nformati on.  
11.  The instant  Civil Mis c. Appli cations  filed by the  
appellant s are accordingly  allowed  and their curative review 
petitions are dismissed  as withdrawn.
