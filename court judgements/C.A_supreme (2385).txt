Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.  
Criminal Petition No.1149 -L of 2017 :  
   Rizwan Ahmed,  deceased,  20, alongwith Shakil Masih , 
injured (PW-2), in the backdrop of  an election rivalry, were waylaid  
within the p recincts of Police Station Tatleyali, District Gujranwala at 
9:30 p.m. on 11.2.2006 ; Shahbaz Ahmed (PW -1) lodged report  with the 
police  at 10: 30 p.m. wherein the petitioner as well as Qaisar Mehmood 
and Parvez , supported by two  companions, untraced till da te were Criminal Petition No.11 49-L/2017 & Criminal Petition NO.905 -L of 2016

arrayed as suspect . The petitioner, attributed a fatal shot to the 
deceased, stayed away from law whereas Qaisar Mehmood  and Parvez 
Ahmed  co-accused , assigned opening shots to the deceased  and Shakil 
Masih (PW -2), respectively, were tried in his ab sence; convicted for 
homicide and murderous assault, they were sentenced to 
imprisonment for life and 10 -years rigorous imprisonment; the former  
died during pendency of the case whereas the latter served out his 
sentence , reduced by the High Court . After a rrest, the petitioner was 
convicted under clause (b) of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 
1860 , vide judgment dated 13.03.2012  by a learned Addl. Sessions 
Judge at Gujranwala; he was sentenced to death, alt ered into 
imprisonment for life  vide impugne d judgment dated 08.06.2016 , vires 
whereof, are being assailed  on the grounds that petitioner’s absconsion 
notwithstanding, there was no occasion for visiting him with a guilty 
verdict in a night affair with identity  issue, looming large on the scene , 
mere ly on the strength of a misconceived and misplaced suspicion , 
rooted into a past motive that had long withered away . It is next argued 
that inconsequential recovery without any forensic comparison was 
entirely beside the mark  and, thus, in absence of any c orroboration , it 
was unsafe to place implicit reliance on a flawed ocular account . 
Learned Law Officer, assisted by counsel for the complainant, has 
faithfully defended the judgment.  
2.  Heard. Record perused.  
3.  Survival of Shahbaz Ahmed (PW -1) unscathed  during the 
assault , by itself, cannot imply  his absence from the scene and as such 
does not undermine his status as a witness worthy of credence ; 
a closely related resident of the locality , his  encounter with the 
deceased  and the injured  in the neighbou rhood, does not raise 
eyebrows ; steps taken by him after the incident are inconsonance with 
the investigative details  and, thu s, confirmatory to his presence.   
A somewhat lengthy cross -examination failed to tremor his testimony,  
substantially  in line with th e ocular account furnished by  two other 
witnesses that included an injured as well ; it squarely constitutes 
“proof beyond doubt ” , admitting no hypothesis other than petitioner’s 
guilt whose absence from law  for a period exceeding three years  does 
not brilliantly reflect upon his unsupported plea of false implication ;  
in retrospect, it also indemnifies  the impact of inconsequential recovery Criminal Petition No.11 49-L/2017 & Criminal Petition NO.905 -L of 2016

of a .30 caliber pistol (P -4), otherwise found consistent with the 
contour s of the fatal shot . Available source of li ght vividly shown in the  
site plan,  in the given proximity inter se  the parties,  the issue of 
identification , blown out of proportion , least compromises 
preponderance of overwhelming evidence , inescapably pointed on the 
culpability of the accused , each judicially taken to the task . 
Concurrent conclusions by the courts below , on our own independent 
analysis,  have been found by us , well within the remit of safe 
administration of criminal justice and, thus, call  for no interference. 
Petition fails. Leave decli ned.  
 
Criminal Petition No.905 -L of 2016  
   Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks withdrawal of this 
petition. Dismissed as withdrawn.
