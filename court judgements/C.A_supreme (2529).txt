IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ .—   Energy  has 
acquired great importance in our daily life. It is part of our life more 
than ever before. From aircrafts to cars, televisions to cell phone s, air 
conditioning to water heating , pharmaceuticals to p lastics  and 
fertilizers to cement,  energy makes it all possible.  Beyond the 
requirement of peoples’ domestic use, energy is essential for wide 
range of essential activities, namely, agriculture, con struction, 
manufacturing, health and social services. Without availability of 
energy, familiar elements of modern life would not exist. There are  
more than 7 billion people on E arth who use energy to make their lives 
safer, healthier and more productive. Every single product we buy, 
bread or cloth, requires energy.  The desire of human being to improve 
its living standard is the biggest driver of energy demand.   
 5 
2.  It is a well -known fact that i n future, in developing 
countries, the energy demand will grow around 60%. The most 
significant fact in increase in energy demand is the g rowing electricity 
requirement . For electricity generation, natural gas, which emits up to 
60% less carbon -dioxide emissions than coal, will be the fastest -
growing major fuel. The en ergy demand growth requires 
unprecedented levels of investment and the pursuit of all energy 
sources.  
3.  In order to emerge from global recession and financial 
crisis, countries are looking for solutions to improve domestic 
economic performance. The ener gy sector constitutes a relatively 
modest share of GDP in most countries. However, its impact on the 
economy is much greater, as goods and services could be provided 
without it. Thus, availability of energy at reasonable price is required 
to reignite, sust ain and expand economic growth.  
4.  In the world of the 21st century, it seems unfathomable for 
life to carry on without the provision of an uninterrupted supply of 
energy in the form of electricity. Electricity pervades every part of 
human life; so much so that the economy, particularly industry, is 
heavily dependent on electricity. Fossil fuels, which are used in 
producing electricity, are fast depleting the world over. We as a nation 
need to do whatever we can to conserve energy so that we can 
continue to progress. The availability of energy and the progress of a 
nation -state are inextricably linked. Article 38 of the Constitution 
commands, “The State shall… …secure the well -being of the people… by 
raising their standard of living…” Without energy, there can be no  
 6 
progress, no development which will raise the standard of living of the 
people as commanded by Article 38  ibid. A country without energy is a 
country paralysed. Unfortunately, this is the case with Pakistan. We 
are constantly faced with massive l oadshedding, particularly of 
electricity in the summer season and of gas in the winter season. Our 
once thriving industries are now reduced to a state of non -
functionality. The everyday life of the common man is hampered by 
this massive loadshedding. No ec onomic sector can be expected to run 
without the provision of energy.  
5.  In the month of April, 2013 it was reported in the print and 
electronic media that there was severe shortfall of electricity in the 
country. The  news  clippings   published    in the  Daily  “Dawn”    and  
 " "روزﻧﺎﻣہ ﭘﺎﮐﺴﺘﺎن  wherein it was mentioned that the Chairman of Pakistan 
Industrial and Traders Associations Front (PIAF) appealed to the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan to take notice of unprecedented loadsheding due to 
which industrial production had nosedived.  The news items were 
placed before one of us (Chief Justice) and the office was directed to 
put up the matter. The matter was registered as Human Rights Case 
No.14392/2013 and put up in Chambers, having seen the acute 
shortage of electricity, as was eviden t from the contents of news 
clipping, the matter was dealt with under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution because it involved fundamental rights of general public 
under Articles 9, 18 and 25 of the Constitution  and was directed to be 
put in Court.  
6.  It is to be noted that i n the matter of:  Alleged Corruption 
in Rental Power Plants  (2012 SCMR 773) this Court has held the  
 7 
provision of electricity comes under the guarantee of the right to life 
enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution  as interpreted in the 
celebrated judgment  of Shehla Zia v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1994 
Supreme Court 694). Thus the matter is undoubtedly one of public 
importance  concerning the fundamental rights of the people of 
Pakistan . In the Rental Power Plants case (ibid) we have dil ated upon 
such matters at great length, so there it is beyond doubt that the 
Supreme Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the provision of 
energy to the people of Pakistan. The relevant portions of the said 
judgment  are reproduced as under: - 
5. It may b e stated that in Pakistan, electricity is 
produced from hydel, oil, gas, coal and nuclear sources. 
Hydel and thermal power generation was previously under 
the control of WAPDA. To augment the generation capacity 
to meet demand and eliminate inefficiencies due to 
WAPDA's growth, demand suppression and high tariff 
policy and proliferated theft, WAPDA's Power Wing was 
restructured/segregated into twelve (12) distinct 
autonomous entities under the Companies Ordinance 
1984, viz., three generation, one transmissi on and eight 
distribution corporate entities. Thus, electricity generation 
from thermal sources is under the control of Generation 
Companies (GENCOs) carved out of WAPDA, which are 
exclusively owned by the Government of Pakistan. These 
companies have long term projects called IPPs, spreading 
over a period of 25 to 30 years. The electric power 
generated by GENCOs is delivered to NTDC, which in turn, 
delivers the same to DISCOs. The DISCOs then sell it to 
the consumers under the contracts of electric powers o n 
specified terms.  
At the same time, in view of the non -availability of the  
 8 
information regarding generation of electricity by PEPCO 
on its website (www.pepco.gov.pk), on 16 -3-2012 the 
Registrar was directed to procure the following 
information: - 
(i) Tota l generation capacity (Hydel, IPP, RPP, etc.);  
(ii) Total electricity generated for the last one year (Hydel, 
IPP, RRP, etc.), if shortage, assigned reasons;  
(iii) Detail of IPPs, which are generating and not 
generating electricity and the reasons for the same;  
(iv) Monthly/weekly average of production of each RPP;  
(v) Net demand of electricity for each month during the 
last one year; and  
(vi) As to why PEPCO website is not being updated?

The reasons assigned for power shortages are as under: - 
Requirements as per Serial Nos (ii) and (iii) of the 
Directio ns of Hon'able Supreme Court of Pakistan  
(ii) Total electricity generated for the last one year 
(Hydel, IPP,RPP, etc.) if shortage, assigned reasons.  
(iii) Detail of IPPs, which are generating and not  
 10
generating electricity and the reasons for the same  
Operational Constraints of the Power Generation and 
Distribution System  
1. Diversion of gas, reduced power generation and 
increased cost of generation whereas no tariff 
increase allowed from FY 2003 to FY 2007, despite 
steep increase in generation cost due t o surge in oil 
prices.  
1(sic). Overdue rehabilitation of distribution network 
and Public Sector Generation Companies (most of 
the plants have been outlived) due to time and 
financial constraints causing increase in distribution 
and generation losses.  
2. Increased non -payment of bills (collection issues, 
including extra ordinary stay by the courts) and 
Kunda Culture  
3. Mismatch between cost of supply and tariff 
triggered birth of circular debt and adversely affected 
fuel supplies to IPPs and GENCOs plants.  
4. IRSA releases water from dams exclusively as per 
cultivation requirement and not for power 
requirement.  
Other Reasons:  
5. Public  Sector   was  not  allowed  to  add  new  
capacity  in thermal since long time resulting in no 
capacity additions during 20 03-2008 
6. Quantum jump in power demand (7% to 14%) 
due to:  
 Consumption led growth strategy of 2002 -2008 
- influx of millions of household appliances.  
 Continuous increase in rural electrification since 
2002 onwards.  
 Increased demand for agri -tubewell loads  - over 
80,000 new connections.  
7. Extra high Load growth in urban areas (20%)  
8. Air -conditioning load exceeds 5000 MW and is  
 11
being added each year.  
…………………………………………………………………………………….  
21. It has been admitted on behalf of PEPCO and GENCOs 
that phenomenon o f rental power projects to overcome the 
shortage of electric power was introduced by the 
Government for the first time in the year 2006, considering 
it to be a short term measure. Two unsolicited rental 
contracts were executed with Messrs Alstom for 136 MW  at 
Bhikki and Messrs General Electric Power for 150 MW at 
Saharanpur respectively.  
67. The necessity in introducing the concept of RPPs is 
apparent from the facts that in the year 2006 when the 
then Government decided to adopt the phenomenon of 
rental pow er projects, no feasibility study was carried out 
which is crucial because study is based on the input of the 
experts on the subject to determine whether or not the 
implementation of the project is advisable. It is well known 
that feasibility study is base d on the extensive research to 
ascertain that what would be the impact of such a project 
in terms of costs of the project, its results, future 
prospects, operational implications, advantages and 
disadvantages, keeping in view the situation like alleged 
shortage of electricity. The Government had formulated 
energy policies in the years 1994 -2002 on the basis 
whereof IPPs were installed, therefore, had the 
Government allowed the experts on the subject of electric 
energy/power to examine merits and demerits of  
introducing the RPP regime, it would have helped in 
implementing the Rental Power Projects in a highly 
transparent manner. It is a fact that during the previous 
regime, Rental Power Projects were installed at Sharaqpur 
and Bhikki on the recommendation of WAPDA. Though it is 
stated that tender notices were issued in the newspapers, 
but no response was received, however, copies of such 
notices have not been made available on record. Further, it 
is alleged that decision to install RPPs was based on the 
recomm endations of ECC dated 16 -8-2006 in the case 
No.ECC -135/9/06, contents whereof have been reproduced 
hereinabove, but it pertained to 150 MW at Piranghaib, 
Multan, and subsequent thereto another project on the 
same site for 192 MW was approved contrary to t he PPRA 
Rules (detailed discussion has been made hereinabove) 
and the same was signed off, which caused considerable 
loss to the public exchequer.   
 12
7.  It is an undisputed fact that existing resources , i.e. Hydel 
and Thermal , etc.,  as is evident from the a bove paras,  are not 
sufficient  to cater for the basic electricity requirements. Inasmuch as , 
the IPPs were installed but IPPs and other re-sources which have been 
used for generation of electricity had not proved sufficient.  
8.  At this stage, it would be appropriate to note that this 
Country has been facing electricity crises  since long. Previously , in the 
year 1990, the scheme of Independent Power  Projects  (IPPs)  was 
launched. Under the said scheme many power projects were 
established. With regard to one of the IPPs, namely, HUBCO Power 
Purchase Agreement was executed on 03.08.1992 along  with an 
Implementation Agreement guaranteeing due performance of the 
aforesaid Agreement. A Sovereign Guarantee was also executed on 
behalf of the President of Pakistan un dertaking to pay the amount 
falling due under the aforesaid agreement. The agreement was 
supplemented and amended by the Supplemental Deed dated 
16.11.1993. Thereafter, the agreement was amended o n 24.02.1994 
and 17.10.1 994. There was allegation of corrupt ion and corrupt 
practices in the award of said agreement, which culminated into 
litigation.  On 08.05.1998 a Writ Petition No.8755 of 1998 was filed in 
Lahore High Court under "public interest litigation", inter alia, asserting 
that amendment No.2 to the Po wer Purchase Agreement being without 
consideration, unauthorised, illegal and fraudulent was ineffective in 
law. The High Court directed WAPDA to pay Rs.761million per month 
more to HUBCO than the amount which was paid to other concerned 
using similar tech nology. Civil Petition for leave to appeal filed in this  
 13
Court by HUBCO was disposed of with consent of the parties. The 
dispute remained pending adjudication before various forums including 
International Chamber  of Commerce, Civil Court, High Court and th is 
Court, when ultimately this Court vide order dated 14.06.2000 passed 
in the HUB Power Company Limited v. Pakistan WAPDA (PLD 2000 SC 
841) HUBCO was  restrained from invoking the arbitration clause of the 
agreement  for the following reasons: - 
“The allegati ons of corruption in support of which the above  
mentioned circumstances do provide prima facie basis for 
further probe into matter judicially and, if proved, would render 
these documents as void, therefore, we are of the considered 
view that according to the public policy such matters, which 
require finding about alleged criminality, are not referable to 
Arbitration.  
The disputes between the parties are not commercial dispute 
arising from an undisputed legally valid contract, or relatable to 
such a contrac t, for, according to the case of WAPDA on account 
of these criminal acts disputed documents did not bring into 
existence any legally binding contract between the parties, 
therefore, the dispute primarily relates to very existence of a 
valid contract and no t a dispute under such a contract. ” 
9.  In the meantime, on 16.12.1997, to provide for the 
regulation of generation, transmission and distribution of electric 
power and matters connected therewith and incidental thereto, the 
Regulation of Generation, Trans mission and Distribution of Power Act, 
1997 was promulgated. In 1998, Pakistan Electric Power Company 
(PEPCO) was incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 with 
a view to improve the efficiency of the power sector, to meet 
customers' electric energy  requirements on a sustainable and 
environment al friendly basis, to stop load shedding, to construct new 
grid stations, to reduce line losses, to minimize tripping and theft 
control, to revamp generation units and to improve customer services,  
 14
and develop a n integrated automated power planning system for 
generation, transmission and distribution to ensure system stability, 
fault isolation and upgrade relaying, metering and tripping system at 
the level of National Transmission and Distribution Company (NTDC) 
as well as Distribution Companies (DISCOs).  
10.  In the military regime, phenomenon of Rental Power 
Projects  (RPPs)  to overcome the shortage of electric power was 
introduced by the Government in the year 2006, considering it to be a 
short term measure. Tw o unsolicited rental contracts were executed 
with Messrs Alstom for 136 MW at Bhikki and Messrs General Electric 
Power for 150 MW at Saharanpur respectively.  However, both the 
projects failed to generate electricity up  to their maximum capacity. 
Despite fa ilure of the phenomenon, in the year 2008 again the 
government adopted mode of generating electricity through RPPs as is 
evident from the paras from RPPs case,  reproduced hereinabove.   
11.  It is to be noted that as the natural gas was to be used for 
both these RPPs as the fuel and availability factors of both the plants 
were 92% and both the projects generated (MKWH) 1515 and 816 
respectively on account of plant factor average 39% and 26% 
comparing to availability factor 92%. The financial impact was on 
account of CPP tariff determined by NEPRA (Rs./kW/Month) and CPP -
FOM charge (Rs./kW/Month). Thus, due to tariff determination by the 
NEPRA according to the available formula, considerable losses occurred 
to NPGCL. Despite failure of the phenomenon, in the y ear 2008 again 
the Government adopted mode of generating electricity through RPPs 
as is evident from the portion of judgment from RPPs’ case  (supra),  
 15
reproduced hereinabove.   
12.  It may also be observed here that this Court has already 
observed in RPPs’ case (supra) that the NEPRA being an independent 
regulatory body had to perform its functions according to law. As per 
section 7(3)(a) of the Act, 1997, NEPRA is exclusively responsible for 
determining tariff, rates, charges and other terms and conditions for 
supply of electric power services by the generation, transmission and 
distribution companies and recommend to the Federal Government for 
notification. Under section 7(6) of the Act, 1997, the NEPRA is 
mandated to protect the interests of consumers and companies 
providing electric power services in accordance with the guidelines, not 
inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, laid down by the Federal 
Government. Therefore, the NEPRA cannot close its eyes and 
determine tariff contrary to the provisions of the Act, 1997. Further, 
under section 31 of the Act, 1997 and Rule 17(2) of the National 
Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Tariff Standards and Procedure) 
Rules, 1998, the NEPRA is required to lay down procedures and 
standards for the purpose of dete rmination of tariff. However, it might 
not be possible for the NEPRA to discharge its functions because of the 
instructions and interference by the Ministry of Water and Power, 
which had been issuing instructions from time to time, but in any case, 
instead  of following mandatory provisions of the Act, 1997, the NEPRA 
ought not to have compromised its position.  
13.  The Court has been informed that there are number of 
factors of energy crises, especially the shortfall of electricity, including 
increase in de mand of electricity due to increase in population, new  
 16
electric connections, electric supply to new villages; decrease in 
generation of electricity due to shortage in river waters, non -
availability of CNG/Natural Gas, non -construction of new dams; 
ineffici ent power plants; theft and non -payment of electricity bills; and 
line losses, etc. Besides, corruption, inefficiency, mismanagement and 
defective planning in WAPDA are also contributor y factors for increase 
in loadshed ding. In this regard, countrywise loa d management 
schedule was placed befor e Court, which reads as under: -

14.   One of the core problems lies in electricity theft. Large 
sections of population, especially rural farms with hundreds of tube 
wells, government departments, residents of FATA, Karachi, Sindh, 
Seraiki belt, KPK and Baluchis tan, and many industrial and production 
units, etc., are not paying electricity bill at all or according to cost of 
electricity they are consuming. In this regard, during the last year a 
loss of around Rs.750 billion was caused. The consumers in Pakistan 
are facing electricity shortages of the worst order whereas nothing is 
being done about the parasite which is heavily responsible for this 
conundrum: the electricity thief. The consumer is made to pay 
exorbitant bills to cover up the losses that are made be cause the 
electricity thief gets his electricity for free. He steals this valuable 
natural resource from the people of Pakistan with impunity; and 
nothing is done to stop him. The government must take strict action 
against such thieves to end the loadshedd ing crisis.  
15.  In the hearing of the present case, the Court directed Mr. 
Zargham Eshaq, MD PEPCO vide order dated 01.07.2013 to provide 
“details of all the IPPs operating on Gas or RFO in the country along 
with the details of their electricity generatin g capacity and if there is a 
shortfall reasons for the same along with the procedure required to be 
followed by PEPCO, NTDC, NEPRA or any other regulatory authority to 
pursue them to achieve maximum target of generation of electricity as 
payments of their bills are causing extra load on the public exchequer 
and despite of it they are not getting electricity. ” 
16.  In response to the Court order of 01.07.2013, Mr. 
Zargham Eshaq placed on record the following tables which indicate

18.  The Court was of the opinion that  all stakeholders were 
entitled to consume electricity as per the formula of “equitable 
distribution ” of available electricity . The above charts paint the stark 
picture of the difference between the capacity o f the plants and the 
amount of electricity that they are actually generating. The total 
generation has been shown to be 13392 MW up until 30.06.2013. It is 
equally important to note that electricity generation of all of the 
captive power plants, IPPs and K ESC has not been shown, but it has 
been shown that KESC exports 600 MW to NTDC. Thus, the upshot of 
the above three charts is that the existing resources at the system’s 
disposal are sufficient to overcome the electricity shortfall faced by this  
 20
country. I t seems that the loadshedding problem is a result of 
mismanagement or want of administrative control by relevant 
functionaries. It has been admitted that the average minimum amount 
of loadshedding is ten hours per day. If this figure were to be taken at 
face value, that means for nearly half of a day, there is no provision of 
electricity to all sectors, most important of all industry and agriculture. 
It is difficult to envision how the commercial sector can grow and 
develop when there is such a great gap be tween supply and demand 
of a basic commodity like electricity. As mentioned hereinabove, the 
world of today is increasingly dependent on electricity. Scientific 
discovery and innovation has taken human potential to new heights in 
the past decade; whereas i n this country the state of affairs is so 
derelict that people have to time their activities on the basis of when 
electricity is available.  
19.  It is true that one of the reasons for the loadshedding 
crisis is the non -availability of RFO or gas. As shown by the tables 
reproduced hereinabove, RFO and gas -operated plants are not 
producing electricity in consonance with their full potential. MD PEPCO 
provided further figures to the effect that on 09.07.2013, generation 
from IPPs on RFO is about 3790 MW and on  gas is about 2500 MW, 
which only further proves that these plants are operating under 
capacity. MD PEPCO averred that the procedure required to be 
followed to achieve maximum targets of generation of electricity is as 
under: - 
a. The procedure for operatio n of the IPPs implemented under 
the GoP’s 1994 Energy Policy is specified in the Power Purchase  
 21
Agreements (PPAs). Under this procedure the Generating plants 
(IPPs) are supposed to make their plants available for 85% of 
the time in an agreement year. They are allowed allowance of 
15% for “Forced” and “Scheduled” Outage in a year. If the IPPs 
exceed their outage allowances, they are required to pay 
Liquidated Damages (LDs). The oil (RFO)  based plants are also 
required to maintain 30 days storage of oil, whil e the gas plants 
are supplied gas of the required quantity and pressure through 
“Gas Supply Agreement” with gas supply Companies.  
b. When the IPPs do not operate as per their required 
availability, they have to pay Liquidated Damages (LDs)  to the 
Power Pur chase for non -performance. However, when payments 
are delayed to them (due to shortage of funds), the IPPs dispute 
the LDs raised on the pre -text of “Consequence of Default” and 
their oil and gas supplies get disrupted resulting in non -
availability of thei r capacity which is not accepted by the Buyer 
(NTDCL) and LDs are imposed. For 2002 Policy IPPs, deduction 
on account of less capacity available or stoppage of capacity 
payment at the time invoice is received by the buyer.  
c. Plants at HUBCO, KAPCO and Koh inoor Power Limited (KEL) 
are currently not operating on full load due to some of their 
units being on schedule and forced outage and expected back 
online in couple of days. Some of the RFO based plants are 
running at lower than their name plate ratings du e to higher 
ambient temperatures. About 350 MW is not online due to non -
availability of gas. Three (3) IPPs (340 MW) have dispute with 
the Buyer on the cash payments that had already been made to 
these plants. The issue is being sorted out. Two plants HUBC O 
Narowal (214 MW) and liberty (212 MW) are back online after 
settlement  of their disputes/liabilities.  
20.  After having gone through the above facts, it is quite clear 
that the IPPs are not abiding by the terms of the agreements that they 
are bound by. T he picture that is painted by the above submissions of 
MD PEPCO is that IPPs are taking undue and deleterious  advantage of 
the weak financial position of PEPCO. The IPPs slow down their  
 22
production and assign various reasons for non -payment of electricity. 
One reason that could be countenanced as valid in this regard is the 
non-availability of RFO and gas. However, it is also the duty of IPPs to 
take steps to generate electricity to help boost the commercial, 
industrial and agricultural sectors rather than c ontinuously pass the 
buck to PEPCO.  It is for these reasons that on 01.07.2013 we ordered 
a forensic audit of the performance of the IPPs so as to ascertain the 
financial liability on the public exchequer. So far, however, the orders 
of the Court have not been complied with and no audit has been 
conducted.  
21.  It is to be noted that it is the responsibility of WAPDA to 
generate hydroelectricity, which is to account for 33% of the total 
electricity produced. WAPDA is, however, only performing at 60% of 
its own capacity in this regard. The reasons for this are inter alia , the 
decentralisation of WAPDA into different GENCOs providing for a 
possible gap in administrative efficiency, the increased reli ance on RFO 
and gas powered IPPs,  and the seasonal  constraint s on hydroelectric 
power . To elaborate on the last  reason, hydroelectric power is 
generally produced from dams and barrages when the water level in 
the reservoir exceeds a specified level known as “Dead Storage Level”. 
The water level  is dependent on seaso nal rains. However, rather than 
increasing the number of facilities available to harness hydroelectric 
power such as dams, barrages etc. the Government seems to be 
engaged in a policy of promoting RFO as a basis for producing 
electricity. RFO is imported w hereas hydel power is purely indigenous. 
At the same time, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that t he  
 23
33% share of hydroelectric power amounts to only 6,595 MW. The 
average cost of hydel energy generation in Pakistan is Rs.1 to 1.5 per 
kilowatt hour. On the other hand the cost of thermal power is around 
Rs.5/ - on CNG and around Rs.15/ - on RFO. Therefore, the increased 
reliance on RFO is unwarranted. Thus, the reason for non -production 
of electricity to the maxi mum installed capacity is, to a larg e extent,  
financial.  
22.  Furthermore, 70% of Pakistan's oil needs are met through 
imports. Further, the projected lifetime of the existing natural gas and 
oil resources in Pakistan is just over fifteen and nine years 
respectively; therefore, simple incre ase in production by new 
expensive Thermal Units will not solve this issue. However, the 
identified hydropower potential in the country is approxim ately 41,722 
MW, but a cheap, renewable and environment -friendly source of 
energy has remained untapped. In view of these facts, the best 
solution to Pakistan's energy/electricity crisis is hydropower.  
23.  It may further be noted that there are two other resources 
of electricity generation, na mely wind power and solar power,  which 
are currently producing only 4 9.5 MW, mainly by the Fauji Wind Power 
Project. There are thirty other projects out of which, statedly, the 
construction of Zorlu energy (wind power) having capacity of 56.4 MW 
has been completed and has commenced. Other than Zorlu, there are 
three other s uch wind power projects in the pipeline which have 
capacity of 50 MW each and are likely to achieve COD in 2014. LOS 
has been issued to nine other companies to engage in similar projects. 
As far as solar power is concerned, there are fifteen solar power  
 24
projects which are at the initial stage of completing feasibility. 
Moreover, there are also six biomass/bagasse power projects, none of 
which are producing an energy output as of yet.  
24.  It is important to note that DISCOs are purchasing 
electricity at ex pensive rates from Captive Power Projects (CPPs).  
During the course of the proceedings much reference was made to 
Captive Power Plants; which are basically run either on furnace oil 
(RFO) or natural gas to produce electricity. From the record placed 
before  us, it became clear that captive power plants were being 
supplied gas at subsidized rates; whereas they sell electricity at 
marked -up prices to the National Transmission and Despatch Company 
(NTDC). This electricity is thus more expensive than normal rate s and 
is often used to give an uninterrupted supply of electricity to affluent 
cooperative societies. It may also be noted that concessions and 
subsidies should not ordinarily be withdrawn as Pakistan is a welfare 
State as envisioned in Article 38 of the C onstitution, noted 
hereinabove. However, concessions and subsidies must be focused on 
what is most important to the downtrodden classes. The concessions 
and subsidies in case of Captive Power Plants are not being made with 
the interest of the common man as  the goal. Such subsidies also fly in 
the face of the gas allocation policy detailed by Mr. Khalid Anwar, Sr. 
ASC, which shall be discussed below.  
25.  On the hearing dated 22.07.2013, Mr. Arif Hameed, 
Managing Director, SNGPL, stated that a major reason f or lack of 
availability of gas was because bulk of the gas is being supplied to 
fertilizer companies at subsidized rates. In light of this contention, we  
 25
issued notice to the fertilizer companies mentioned by Mr. Arif 
Hameed, namely M/s. Dawood Hercules Ch emicals, Pak Arab 
Fertlizers, AGRITECH, ENGRO, Fauji Fertlizer Bin Qasim, Fauji Fertilizer 
Sadiqabad and Fatima Fertilizer.  
26.  Mr. Khalid Anwar, learned Sr. ASC, appeared on behalf of 
Pak Arab Fertilizers and Fatima Fertilizers. His contentions were ver y 
helpful in elucidating the situation. Mr. Khalid Anwar explained that up 
until 03.07.2012, the fertilizer sector received gas at No. 2 on the 
supply priority list. Thereafter, it was downgraded to No. 3 with 
general industry and the power sector moved up  to No. 2 in 
accordance with the fresh load management policy approved by the 
Economic Coordination Council (ECC) of the Cabinet. The CNG sector, 
on the other hand, is much lower on the priority list, yet the factual 
situation is that they are getting more  gas than the fertilizer sector. He 
provided the following tables to illustrate this point:  
Up to 03 July 2012

27.  Mr. Khalid Anwar also explained at length that there is no 
subsidy given to the fertilizer sector. The government, in fact, use s a 
policy of differential pricing with respect to the sale of gas to the 
fertilizer sector. This means, in effect, that the fertilizer sector has to 
pay less for gas because this in the wisdom of the government furthers 
the socio -economic policy and progr ess of the country. This policy was 
explained by Mr. Feisal Naqvi, ASC on behalf of ENGRO and DH 
Fertlisers. Mr. Feisal Naqvi averred that by providing cheaper gas to 
the fertilizer companies, such companies were able to price their 
products independently of international market forces so as to make 
the fertilizer available at cheaper rates to local farmers. This is 
particularly true of ENGRO, DH, Fatima and Pak Agro Fertilisers, all of 
which manufacture urea and provide it to local farmers at rates 
cheaper  than the international market. Moreover, gas is scientifically 
utilised with greater efficiency in the production of urea. In this regard, 
Mr. Feisal Naqvi placed on record the Final Report of the International 
Resources Group for the Asian Development Ba nk on the “Pakistan 
Integrated Energy Model (Pak -IEM)” dated August 2011. The relevant 
portion of the report reads as under: - 
Gas has a higher economic value for fertilizer production 
compared to power sector.   
 27
The System Level Economic Valuation indicates  that reducing 
gas to the fertilizer sector costs the economy Rs. 196 million per  
MMCFD, while increasing gas to the power sector costs the 
economy Rs 98 million per MMCFD.  
 
28.  The Court exercises judicial restraint in matters of 
government policy excep t where fundamental rights are violated. In 
this instance, we are of the opinion that the Government should follow 
the priority list for allocation of gas and provide the fertilizer sector 
with gas at the No. 3 priority instead of supplying more gas to the  CNG 
sector, which is clearly against the policy that the Government itself 
has set out. It may be noted that there is no check on the sale of urea. 
Much of the urea is smuggled to Afghanistan and Central Asia; and 
until very recently, the price of packs o f urea was not printed on the 
packs, making their sale and pricing arbitrary , thus there is little 
benefit to the farmers . Moreover, it is necessary to provide gas to the 
power sector at the number 2 priority as indicated by the government 
itself due to th e acute loadhsedding problem currently faced by the 
country.  
 
29.  It is clear that the government is not following the policy it 
has set out itself, and it has come to our attention that CNG prices are 
rising much higher than as warranted. The reason we have decided to 
look into the CNG pricing issue is found in the judgement in this very 
case reported as Iqbal Zafar Jhagra v. Federation of Pakistan  (2013 
SCMR 1337). Therein, we held as under: - 
46... We, thus, declare that the Federal Government has no 
lawful authority to impose or recover GST on CNG @ 26% and 
@ 17% on the value of taxable supplies made in the course or 
furtherance of any taxable activities with effect from 13 -6-2013  
 28
until passing of the Finance Bill. The excess amount equal to 
1%, i.e., 1 7% - 16%, of GST recovered on the petroleum 
products/CNG or any other taxable supplies w.e.f. 13 -6-2013 
onward is thus refundable to the consumers and the concerned 
authorities are directed to deposit it with the Registrar of this 
Court subject to passing of the Bill by or under the authority of 
Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament). The observations following the 
procedure of its refund have already been made hereinabove. 
Similarly, the Government has also been directed to deposit 9% 
out of 26% of GST charged on CN G as per notification dated 13 -
6-2013 in the same manner. In respect of recovery of additional 
9%, statement shall also be filed on behalf of the Government 
showing the amount of GST so recovered from the consumers 
under proviso to rule 20(2)(c) of the afo resaid Rules of 2007 on 
the value of CNG in addition to 16% GST imposed under section 
3 of the Act, 1990 as this amount is also to be refunded to the 
consumers, for which appropriate order shall be passed 
subsequently. ..  
48... (ii) Under proviso to rule 2 0(2)(c) of the Sales Tax 
Special Procedures Rules, 2007, 9% in addition to the Sales Tax 
prescribed under section 3 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 imposed 
or recovered from the consumers on CNG is unconstitutional 
and contrary to Articles 3, 9, 24 and 77 of th e Constitution as 
well as section 3 of the Sales Tax Act...  
(vi) The excess amount equal to 1% (17% -16%) of the Sales 
Tax recovered on the petroleum products/CNG or any other 
taxable supplies w.e.f. 13 -6-2013 onwards, thus is refundable to 
consumers and co ncerned authorities accordingly are directed to 
deposit it with the Registrar of this Court subject to passing of 
the Finance Bill (Money Bill) 2013 -14 by or under the authority 
of the Majlis -e-Shoora ; 
If the Sales Tax is imposed by the Majlis -e-Shoora to be 
recovered with retrospective effect, same s hall be paid to the 
Government, otherwise appropriate orders will be passed for its 
disbursement;  
(vii) The Government is also directed to deposit 9% out of 
26% of the Sale Tax on CNG as per notification dated 13-6-
2013 in the same manner as it has been noted above;   
 29
(viii) A statement shall also be filed by the Government 
showing the amount of Sales Tax recovered @ 9% under 
proviso to rule 20(2)(c) of the aforesaid Rules 2007 on value of 
the CNG from the consume rs in addition to declared Sales Tax 
of 16% imposed under section 3 of the Act, 1990 as this amount 
is also to be refunded to the consumers, for which appropriate 
order shall be passed subsequently;  
30.  Office had reported that compliance of the above dir ections 
had not been made. On 05.07.2013, we heard the learned Attorney -
General for Pakistan, to whom we inquired how the additional sales tax 
of 9%, which is not prescribed under section 3 of the Sales Tax, 1990, 
is being recovered on CNG. His contention was that levy of additional 
tax is permissible under the Finance Act, 2013 w.e.f 01.07.2007. We 
considered it appropriate to put the following queries to the learned 
Attorney -General: - 
(i) Whether under Article 77 of the Constitution, GST is 
recoverable on  petroleum products, etc., as well as on CNG 
w.e.f. 13.06.2013 and 01.07.2007 retrospectively?  
(ii) Whether in addition to GST, prescribed under section 3 of 
the act, 1990, 9% added tax can be levied on CNG; if it is so, 
levy of additional tax of 9% is not  discriminatory?  
(iii) Whether GST on Gas Infrastructure Development Cess 
(GIDC) at 17%+9% is not recoverable because the payment of 
the cess is not recovered on taxable activities or taxble supplies; 
if so, to what effect?  
The learned Attorney -General was  also asked to place on record a 
comparative study of the taxes duly levied by the Finance Act, 2013 to 
ascertain as to whether the end consumers of the petroleum products 
and CNG have been treated equally with other taxpayers.

He also furnished replies of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the 
foregoing queries. The queries were replied to as under: -  
(i) The proviso to Rule 20(2)(c) of the Sales Tax (Special 
Procedure) Rules, 2007 did not charge an additional levy, 
rather it only changed the mode of collection of tax to 
improve compliance. However, in accordance with the 
orders of the Court in Iqbal Zafar Jhagra’s case  (supra ), 
Parliamen t inserted a new sub -section (8) in section 3 of 
the Sales Tax Act, 1990 through the Finance Act, 2013 
w.e.f. 01.07.2013, which  has protected and validated the 
sales tax already collected under the Sales Tax (Special 
Procedure) Rules, 2007 w.e.f. 01.07.20 07. 
(ii) Sales tax is a value -added tax where every person in the 
supply chain has to charge sales tax on the taxable 
supplies made by him. In short, every person in the 
supply chain only pays sales tax on value -addition made 
by him. In the case of CNG sta tions also, sales tax was 
chargeable at the standard rate. However, most of the 
CNG stations did not get themselves registered and pay 
sales tax in accordance with law. To address this 
situation, the Federal Government changed the mode of 
collection of sal es tax from CNG stations to ensure proper 
collection and payment of the same tax. Therefore, there 
is no discrimination. The levy was not increased; only the 
mode of collection was changed for valid administrative 
reasons.  
(iii) GIDC has been levied under the Gas Infrastructure 
Development Cess Act, 2011 and can be charged only by 
companies specified in the First Schedule to the Act, from 
their consumers (other than domestic consumers). These 
consumers (which include CNG stations), cannot 
charge/further pas s on the cess as such. Thus, GIDC 
becomes part of the cost of the CNG stations, and should 
not be considered as an indirect tax to be passed on to 
end consumers. Thus, like all other costs (such as cost of 
gas, labour, electricity, overheads, advertising e tc.), in 
case of CNG stations, GIDC is a component of the cost of  
 32
the business to be included in the sale price of the 
product.  
32.  The learned A ttorney -General  also placed  on record a table 
which attempted to show that the tax was not discriminatory, in 
compliance wit h the Court order of 05.07.2013. According to the FBR, 
the table shows that the tax collected under the Special Procedure 
actually benefits the end consumer because it is less than the tax 
collected under the normal regime.  We are of the cons idered opinion 
that the contentions of the learned Attorney -General and the FBR 
cannot be accepted. It is admitted that the sale price of CNG is 
increased by virtue of the added 9% tax. Therefore, it is erroneous 
and contradictory to state that the 9% is n ot passing on to the 
consumer. Moreover, section 3(1) of the 1990 Act is a charging 
section; and under section 2(46) no other section of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990 can be utilised to charge tax other than a charging section. 
Therefore, the new sub -section 8 a dded by the Finance Act, 2013 is 
contradictory with respect to section 3(1). In this behalf, reference 
may be made to Collector of Sales Tax and Central Excise, Lahore v. 
WAPDA  (2007 SCMR 1736) and Sheikhoo Sugar Mills v. Government of 
Pakistan (2001 SCMR 1376) to the effect that it is trite law that only a 
charging section can be used to impute taxes. Therefore, section 3(8) 
is ultra vires section 3(1) of the Sales Tax Act and is struck down as 
such.  
33.  It must be noted that throughout these proceedings it was 
highlighted that NEPRA is playing a highly inactive role in fixing power 
tariff. As elaborated hereinabove, it is the mandate of NEPRA to make  
 33
an independent determination of power tariff under section 31 of the 
1997 Act. However, it was found that the Ministry of Water and Power  
was, in fact, fixing the said tariff instead of NEPRA as highlighted by 
Mr. Azhar Siddique, ASC on behalf of the Applicant in H.R.C. 14392 of 
2013. The Notifications in this regard were S.R.O. 698(I)/2013 dated 
08.05.2013 an d S.R.O. 834(I)/2013 dated 30.09.2013 which t he Co urt 
struck down  vide order dated 04.10.2013. However, the exorbitant 
tariff was reinstated by NEPRA and the subsidy that is afforded to 
consumers was taken away under s 31 of the 1997 Act  vide 
notification dated 10.10.2013 as noted in 22.10.2013 . It is not 
disputed that Government  has the power to take away subsidies. This 
is a power which the Executive undoubtedly enjoys. However, this 
power must be exercised in consonance with the command of Article 
38 of the Constitution as stated hereinabove. Article 38 commands the 
State to act for the welfare of its citizens. With a large number of the 
population living below the poverty line, it is difficult to comprehend 
how a raised electricity tariff which does not afford any subsidy is in 
the benefit of the people. It has already been stated above that the 
provision of electricity is a substantive part of the right to life. In the 
wake of loadshedding and high electricity tariffs, it is clear that the 
government pol icy in this regard is violative of Article 9 of the 
Constitution.   
34.  It would not be out of place to mention that petrol prices in 
the country are skyrocketing, even though petrol prices in the 
international market are steadily decreasing. There seems to be no 
policy justification for such increase. It is beyond doubt that the petrol  
 34
prices should be set in consonance with the international market. 
Petrol  and Diesel are  of imperative need to the economy and to the 
populace. As stated above, Article 38 o f the Constitution directs the 
State to act for the welfare of the people. Fixing high petrol /diesel  
rates without justification is clearly not in the welfare of the people.  
35.  From the aforementioned, it is abundantly clear that we 
have the resources an d capability to overcome loadshedding. The total 
requirement of electricity ranges from 13000 – 18000 MW as is 
evident from the table reproduced hereinabove provided in the Rental 
Power Plants ’ case (supra ). It seems that the government is interested 
in installing new projects which are costly and do not fulfil our 
requirements. If we use the existing resources, while giving priority to 
capacity building of hydroelectric power, we can overcome the scourge 
of loadshedding.  
36.  As a consequence of the above  discussion, i t is declared 
and held as under : - 
(i) Loadshedding of electricity in the country is manageable  
subject to  dedicated  and committed efforts to ensure  the 
maximum  possible generation of electricity which is  
sufficient to cater to the requirement of  all the categories 
of the stake holders/consumers . The competent authority 
must concentrate its efforts to minimise the sufferings of 
the consumers  by endeavouring to provide uninterrupted 
supply of electricity . If, however,  loadshedding is the only 
way ou t, it must be administered  without having  
 35
distinction betwe en rural and the urban areas as well as 
domestic, commercial and industrial sectors.  Moreover, a 
formula must be put in place to ensure the distribution of 
electricity on equitable basis . 
(ii) The compe tent authority shall  take steps to control all 
kinds of losses after supply of the generation like line  
losses, theft , etc., by using  modern devi ces like 
introducing smart meters  and supplying electricity only to 
the consumers, who are ready and willing to  make 
payment, if need be, in advance or without any default 
after submission of the bills.  As far as all kinds of 
unauthorized consumers are concerned, efforts should be 
made to persuade them to make payments of the bills, 
failing which action as envisag ed under the Electricity Act, 
1910, the Electricity Rules, 1937  and NEPRA Act, 1997  as 
well as other enabling laws/rules, should be taken . A policy 
has to be anno unced by the NTDC /DISCOS  under which 
the supply of electricity to the consumers who believe in  
law and make the payment in time  is encouraged  and 
supply of unauthorized consumers is  discouraged.  
(iii) It is responsibility of the NEPRA and PEPCO t o reduce the 
prices while ensur ing that electr icity is generated through 
less-costing value of production fro m hydel power . And as 
far as thermal power is concerned, preference must be 
given to generate electricity by using  coal and gas,  and 
unless there is no compu lsion, the elec tricity should not be  
 36
generated from RFO as it is casting higher prices, which 
ultimately has to be  borne by the consumers. Furthermore, 
the renewable sources for generating electricity including 
wind and solar  power  must be utilized.  
(iv) Prices of petrol, diesel, petrole um products, etc. are 
invariably  being fixed by OGRA arbitrarily withou t taking 
into consideration the r ate in the international market. 
Therefore, in future , all necessary steps shall be taken in 
this behalf to fix the prices strictly in accordance with the 
prevailing rates in the international market.  
(v) As far as supply  of gas at subsidize d rates to the fertilizer 
companies are concerned, it may continue but at the same 
time there must be a policy to ensure that the prod uction 
of the fertilizers like u rea etc. is sold in the market to the 
farmers at a subsidized rate. Howe ver, as far as captive 
power plants  are concerned, the policy must be revised 
and without any justification they cannot be allowed supply 
of gas to produce electric ity because they supply electricity 
at much higher than the NEPRA rate instead of  subsidized 
rate to NTDC. Therefore , the supply of gas to captive 
power plants should be revised to a lower priority and not 
at a subsidized rate . 
(vi) NEPRA has failed to perform its duties strictly in 
accordance with the  Regulation of Generation, 
Transmission and Distribut ion of Electric Power Act, 1997 .  
 37
As it has been discussed hereinabove, without any 
unnecessary  interference, the NEPRA must watch interest 
of stakeholders /consumers  while determining the tariff of 
the electricity and opportunity of hearing must be ensured 
to all concerned.  
(vii) The Federation of Pakistan under Article 38 of the 
Constitution as a policy is bound to  secur e the well -being 
of the people by raising their standard of living . Therefore, 
the subsi dy already being given to them should h ave not 
been with drawn. Though subsidy  is not the right of the 
consumers , the Government being responsible for their 
welfare may consider in near future  to increase the rate of 
subsidy  by extending its benefits to the consumers, who 
are not in a position to pay high charge s of the electricity.  
(viii)  As far as subsection (8) of section 3 of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990 inserted by means of Finance Act, 2013 i s concerned, 
it is contr ary to law and the Constitution. Therefore, levy 
of extra tax  at the rate of 9% cannot be charged except  
the rate which has been fixed under section 3(1)  of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990. Moreover, the same directions and 
the ratio of the  judgment  dated 21.06.2013 reported as  
Iqbal Zafar Jhagra v. Federation of Pakistan  (2013 SCMR 
1337),  where in rule 7 of the Prov isional Collection of Taxes 
Act, 1931 was declared ultra vires, shall b e applicable in 
this case.  OGRA is directed to issue revised notificat ion to 
recover only 16% or 17% sales tax as early as  possible but  
 38
not beyond the period of seven days and the extra  sales 
tax shall be deposited by FBR within three months  in the 
manner as was directed in the judgment (ibid) and the 
matter shall be fixed before the Court for issuing guidelines 
for its disbursement.  
(ix) As far as recovery of the gas development charges GDI C is 
concerned, it falls within the definition of  section  2(46) of 
the Sales Tax Act, 1990  and no order is required to be 
passed in this behalf.  
(x) An exercise has also been undertaken to inquire into the 
grant of licenses  to the various CNG stations . These were 
prima facie unauthorizedly issued  from time to time is 
delinked and this aspect of the case is to be heard along 
with the case of implementation in the case of 
appointment of Tauqir Sadiq  reported as Muhammad Yasin 
v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2012 SC 132) and the Court 
shall decide it on the basis of evidence r ecorded by the FIA 
independently. The FIA is directed to handover it to NAB 
where already proceedings of Tauqir Sadiq  are pending.  
(xi) Similarly,  Suo Motu Case No.1 of 2013, Civil Petition 
No.455  of 2013 are  delinked and ordered to be fixed along 
with implementation case noted hereinabove  within two 
weeks . 
(xii) Likewise, CMA No.5962 of 2013 for permission to file Civil 
Review Petition against the judgement of this Court dated 
21.06.2013 passed in CMA N o.3821 of 2013 in Constitution  
 39
Petition 33 and 34 of 2013 shall be heard separately.   
37.  Cases stand disposed of.
