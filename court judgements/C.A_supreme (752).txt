Jawwad S. Khawaja, J.  The present case highlights a serious issue viz. the non 
availability , whether on an official website or in hard form,  of the laws of Pakistan in the 
form of  a consolidated code. Making the applicable laws readily available to the public  is a CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  2
responsibility of the state about which there can be no two opinions. Discharging this 
responsibility is o ne of the pr imary function s of the Federal and Provincial Law 
Departments , a function which they did perform in the past, as we will discuss later in this 
opinion . Yet, now, it appears as if through deliberate effort the law has been shrouded in a 
cloak of secrecy. Regardless of whether this state of affairs has arisen on account of a 
glaring omission  or a deliberate act, it h as serious consequences for state  governance and 
for judicial adjudication of cases. It adversely  effects  the rights of the people of Pakistan  
and contribute s towards  the perpetuation and spread of  lawlessness  in the country .   
 
2. Initially  Suo Moto Case  (‘SMC’)  No.4 of 2004, SMC  Nos.  1, 2, 6 & 7 of 2007 and SMC  
No. 17 of 2007 were taken up when it was noticed that a number of law books privately 
published and cited in court contained glaring mistakes committed by authors and 
publishers  in the text of the statutes . Even bare Acts of statutes were erroneously printed. 
These cases received the attention of the Court and notices were issued to the Bar  Councils 
as well as to certain authors and publishers  of books containing errors . The aforesaid suo 
moto cases were disposed of on 9.5.2013 in the following terms:  
“Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. - In these cases, notices have been served 
in respect of th e glaring mistakes committed by the authors and publishers in 
bare acts and law books. It is pointed out that the matter has already been 
referred to the respective Bar Councils to look into the matter. Since the matter 
relates to the printing of the law b ooks, etc. therefore, the respective Bar 
Councils within their permissible jurisdiction under the Legal Practitioner s 
and Bar Council Act, 1973, shall be free to take action if such material is 
provided to them, therefore, the above -said petitions are disp osed of.”  
 
3. It is apparent from the discussion which follows that the Bar Councils or even the 
Federal and Provincial Governments did not attend to the important legal issues mentioned 
above because no action whatsoever appears to have been taken since the disposal of the 
above noted cases on 9.5.2013. It was on 25.2.2014 while hearing a case (CP No. 102 of 2014) 
it came to our notice that a vital  omission had been made in section 23 of t he Contract Act 
published by Al  Qanun P ublishers and authored by Mr.  M. Mehmood Advocate. We may CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  3
add that the potential financial impact of this case and an erroneous adjudication based on 
the aforesaid publication would have run into billions of rupees.  
 
4. We, therefore, directed the Librarian of this court to examine th e issue and submit a 
report. He has done so , whereafter the case was ordered to be put up in court. It was 
pointed out by the Court Librarian that the issue of gross negligence in the publication of 
law books had been dealt with in the earlier cases noted above. Notices, therefore, were 
issued to the various Bar Councils and also  to the Federal and provincial governments. 
When the governments entered appearance, it was disconcerting to note that they had not 
undertaken any measures to address the dire situa tion and nor had the Bar Councils done 
so despite the order dated 9.5.2013, reproduced above. We had in particular noted that the 
Bar Councils were supposed to look into this matter which seriously undermines the 
administration of justice and results poten tially in immense loss to litigants. On 24.10.2014, 
therefore, we once again issued notices to the five Bar Councils as well as the Federal and 
provincial law departments. On 19.11.2014, we also asked the learned Attorney General to 
inform us if there is a ny effective mechanism or legislation in place to ensure that the 
publication of law books is properly regulated. He was also asked to ascertain if there was 
any law which would impose a civil and/or criminal liability on publishers, authors etc. 
responsib le for publishing law books with such errors. It appears that there is no law on the 
statute book because none was cited before us.  The learned Attorney General, however, 
stated that according to his information the entire  statute book of the Country in th e form 
of the  Pakistan Code was available on the website of the law department , but on 19 .11.2014 
he sought time to confi rm if this indeed was so.  
 
5. Even today and as reflected in the orders passed on the previous dates of hearing, it 
appears that there  is in effect, no serious interest  evinced in the matter  by the concerned 
authorities.  Neither  the Bar Councils (who have since the past few dates of hearing stopped 
appearing in this case ) nor the Federal or provincial governments have shown any 
seriousne ss of intent in addressing what clearly is  a major issue . We find it to be quite 
extraordinary that there is in fact no official publication whether in hard form or on the 
internet which can provide an accurate and error free version of the law s of Pakista n in one 
easily accessible compendium . As such there are no easy and user -friendly  means available CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  4
to the people of Pakistan to enable them to find out what the statute book contains. The 
abysmal state of affairs was amply demonstrated in a few hearings of  this case , firstly , 
when it was found out by our research staff sitting in Court that when  they tried to access 
the website of the Ministry of Law it was unavailable because of shutdown; secondly , when 
the Pakistan Constitution was not  easily  accessible o n the website of the Ministry  of Law,  it 
could conveniently be accessed through the website of the Library of the United States 
Congress in Washington.  Even today when our research staff attempted to access the 
website of the federal Ministry of Law, Justi ce and Human Rights, although the main page 
of the website opened, but the link namely “Laws” was not accessible and the caption 
appeared that “This web page has a redirect loop ”, but the user was not redirected 
anywhere nor provided any further informatio n about how to gain access .  
 
6. Furthermore, during the hearing of one of the cases in Court on 27.01.2015 we had 
observed that different versions were available regarding Section 420 of the Pakistan Penal 
Code, 1860 being bailable or not. “The Code of Cr iminal Procedure, 1898” by M. Mahmood 
(Edition 2005) stated th e offence was  bailable . On the other hand the “Code of Criminal 
Procedure, Bare Act”, by S.A. Abid (Edition 2012) described it as not-bailable. Such glaring 
errors and mistakes are obviously mis leading legal practitioners and judges too  and are 
creating uncertainty in the administration of law. It should be  obvious that the non -
availability of an easily accessible official version of the Pakistan Code is principally 
responsible for contributing t o this Kafkaesque situation . 
 
7. We are dismayed  to note that even the website of the Ministry of Law is grossly 
inadequate  and no effort or initiative has been taken to bring it up to date. It is only when 
this matter was taken up by this Court and the go vernments  and their law departments  
were reminded of their duties and obligations  that there was some movement to rectify the 
matter . One  fact apparent from the hearings in this case is that the Federal Government had 
a very effective system for compiling the Pakistan Code till 1966 when the last 
compendium  comprising of 16 volumes  of Federal laws was published in a proper and user 
friendly form containing a chronological as well as alphabetical index of the l aws on the 
federal statute book  which included  the amendments made from time to time so that any CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  5
lawyer , judge , researcher or man on the street could  ascertain the state of the law applicable 
in the country.  
 
8. On 8.1.2015, we were informed by our Librarian and later also by the learned DAG , 
that the last official publication is a book titled “Pakistan Code ” which has been published 
by the Manager of Publication, Government of Pakistan, Karachi in the year 2010. A 
cursory examination of said book shows that it is  not the statute book in the form of a C ode 
and is  unhelpful because whilst it has a chronological index of statutes most of these  have 
not been printed in the said book , secondly , there is no alphabetical index as was the norm 
until the publication of the Pakistan Code in proper  format was discontinued after 1966 , 
thirdly , there are no marginal notes or cross referencing of a statute to provisions in another  
connected  statute and , fourthly , there are no foot -notes mentioning the amendments made 
from time to time. The refore,  the said book mention ed by the DAG does  not constitute the 
Pakistan Code.  It has not been explained to us why the manner in which the Pakistan Code  
was published until 1966 was discontinued . 
 
9. The provinces also appeared to be in a similar state of disarray. This was not alw ays 
so. In Sindh there used to be a publication known as the Sindh Code but the last printing of 
the Sindh Code occurred in 1956 , thereafter and till the present day, there is no 
compendium of the provincial laws in Sindh in the form of the Sindh Code . In Balochistan, 
there was a publication by the provincial law ministry which purported to contain the laws 
of the province  last published in 1990 , but the said publication is also not helpful as it does 
not contain an alphabetical index as was done in the Pak istan Code until 1966. In  Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa  we were informed that the provincial code had been published until 1988 
and thereafter the laws of 2013 and 2014 had been published in two volumes  and that the 
gap years  (1988 to 2013 ) will be filled by working backwards from 2013. It is not clear 
whether such  publication will  contain an alphabetical index , which as stated above is the 
most effective and ut ilitarian feature of any statutory compendium . The Punjab province 
appears to be ahead of the other three pr ovinces and the Federation because it has brought 
the Punjab Code up to date although the Additional Secretary of the Punjab  Law Ministry 
has acknowledged that the Code contains errors and omissions which are in the process of 
being rectified.  CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  6
 
10. Neithe r the Provinces nor the F ederation have undertaken the exercise of codifying 
the subordinate legislation made pursuant to rule -making powers given to the  respective  
executives by legislation and nor is there any codification of notifications or other statu tory 
instruments. At present only the Punjab Government appears to have in mind a second 
phase of its Code which will comprise of subordinate legislation and a third phase which 
will comprise of notifications and statutory orders.  The Federation and the Pr ovinces 
claimed to have the laws of the Federation and Provinces respectively on their websites. 
We, however, note that what is displayed on the respective websites is not a Code. The 
Pakistan Code which was modified upto 31st December, 1967 and published by the 
Manager of Publications, Government of Pakistan provides the template of a Code. It can 
be very substantially improved and made user friendly by use of the latest technology. It is 
clear that none of the online publications mentioned by the Law Offi cers of the Federation 
and Provinces can be considered the same as a Code.   
 
11. On 8.1.2015, we were constrained to dir ect the law secretaries of the F ederation and 
the four provinces to make sure that at least the statute book is made available both in hard 
form and on the website of the law departments of the Federation and the four provinces. 
We had noted in our order of the said date that the situation represented by this case is 
alarming and could be one of the contributory causes of the lawlessness which prevails in 
the country today. It is obvious that where applicable laws are not available, there can be 
little expectation or likelihood that the law will be abided  by.  
 
12. At this juncture, it is important to bear in mind that copyright in the law s is vested 
in the governments  which have made such laws. This is also reflected in the Rules of 
Business of the Federal and  the provincial governments made under the Constitution. It , 
however, appears that the books published in print and available for sa le in the country are 
authored and published incorporating the statutes of the Federation and the p rovinces , but 
without the permission of the  concerned  government , being the owners of the copyright. In 
view of the distressing situation which is reflected from the above narrative, it is for the 
governments to rectify the situation , if necessary , by enforcing their copyrights or by CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  7
legislation so that publishers of law books can be dealt with  and penalized  if they publish 
erroneous books.  
 
13. Here  it is also important to emphasize that in any civilized system of government, 
the first and foremost obligation of the government is to make sure that all applicable laws 
are made easily available to citizens in easily understandable language. It was, therefore, a  
matter of great concern to us that the laws , whether Federal or Provincial, had not been 
translated into the national language which is a requirement of Article 251 of the 
Constitution or publicized in provincial/local languages  if considered appropriate , in line 
with the constitutional provision in Article 28 of the Constitution.  Section 78 of the Stamp 
Act 1899  enacted in the pre -independence period provided that , “every Provincial 
Government shall make provision for the sale of translations of this Act in the principal vernacular 
languages of the territories administered by it at a price not exceeding twenty five paisa per copy “. If 
the colonial dispensation could be sensitive to the need for dissemination of laws through 
inexpensive translations, we don ot see why this is not being done post Independence.  
 
14. Because of the inadeq uacy of the functioning of the Federal and provincial law 
departments, we gave extensive hearing to this case on 19th, 21st and 22nd of January, 2015. 
In view of the lack of  assistance received by us  from the concerned Government 
functionaries,  we were constrained to direct the Federal and provincial law secretaries to 
appear and to let us know why the laws of the F ederation and the provinces had not been 
made available to the pe ople of Pakistan  as was the norm in the Federal Law Ministry till 
1966 and in the provinces. There being no explanation forthcoming, the  five law secretaries 
were asked to submit reports setting out targets to be met by the five governments and 
timelines w ithin which such targets are to be met. Reports were submitted by the 
governments from which it appears that the governments of Sindh, Balochistan and the 
Federation are not currently equipped with or in a position to publish whether online or in 
hard form  their respective law codes. As noted earlier, only the Punjab Government 
appears to have made some progress and has published on the official government website, 
the statutes applicable in the Province in the form of a Code. The progress and direction of 
the KPK Government also indicates that a Code  of all laws applicable in the P rovince may 
become available in the near future.  CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  8
 
15. In view of the fact that the five governments were unable to give any satisfactory 
explanation for their glaring omissions  which have  far reaching consequences , we direct ed 
our own research staff to examine the state of affairs in India, Bangladesh and in the United 
Kingdom . In India there is a complete chronological and alphabetical index both in English 
and in Hindi  and all l aws are available in both the said languages on the  internet ('Indian 
Code' (India Code ) < http://indiacode.nic.in/ > accessed 28/01/2015 ) and in printed book 
form. In addition the ‘FreeText Search’ on th e web page can be used by typing in any 
word(s) and all laws containing the said word(s) are shown . This enables any citizen, 
lawyer, judge or researcher to have immediate and easy access to the laws applicable in the 
country. Similarly each of the provinc es (known as States in India ) have their own websites 
which publish the applicable laws  in easily accessible ways . Bangladesh also has the 
Bangladesh Code in Bengali and in English with chronological and alphabetical indices. As 
for the United Kingdom, the re is a complete website for UK and Scottish legislation.  
 
16. Samples from the extracts of the above were printed and paper books of the same 
were supplied by the Court to the law secretaries of the five governments and thei r law 
officers. We are constra ined  to emphasize that this extensive exercise which had been 
undertaken by the Court was in fact the responsibility of the governments and only 
because the gove rnments had failed to fulfill this duty the  Court had to expend  its own 
resources for this purp ose. We may mention that it did not take long for our young and 
relatively inexperienced (for this task) researchers to produce their output. Based on the 
current situation, we are not satisfied that the five Governments will have the willingness 
and/or th e capacity to undertake the relatively simply exercise of preparing the Pakistan 
Code and the Provincial Codes in the form of one consolidated compendium of laws in 
hard and in soft form.  
 
17. Therefore, a fter hearing the Law Officers and  the Law Secretar ies of the five 
Governments and taking into account the reports which have been submitted on behal f of 
the respective Governments  in the present matter, we direct and order as under:  
(i)  The complete Pakistan Code (‘the Code’) shall be compiled and displa yed on 
the website of the Federal Law Ministry . CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  9
(ii)  Bound hard copies of the Code shall be made available for sale throughout 
the country so as to be easily accessible to the public , at inexpensive prices . 
(iii)  An alphabetical consolidated word index c ontaining the words in the title of 
a statute and words defined in the provisions of a statute containing 
definitions shall be included in the alphabetical index.  
(iv)  As a sample of the required consolidated word index, the consolidated index 
appearing at the end of volume 16 of the Pakistan Code published by the 
Manager of Publications, Government of Pakistan, Karachi (1968) may be 
used as a rudimentary sample . Improvements in the sample must  be made 
by use of technology and by benefiting from the Codes  published by 
common law jurisdictions in the subcontinent and elsewhere.  
(v)  The Code shall include in foot -notes , particulars of amendments made from 
time to time in the various statutes published in the Code.  
(vi)  Marginal notes shall be made to cross  reference the provisions of one statute 
with related provisions in another statute. The sample of the Pakistan Code 
published by the Manager of Publications (1968) may be ad apted and 
improved.  
(vii)  Translation into the natio nal language shall be complet ed and displayed in 
easily understandable form  at inexpensive prices . 
(viii)  Translations of the Code into provincial/vernacular languages where 
deemed appropriate by provinces shall be made by the Provinces.  
(ix)  Subordinate  legislation in the form of r ules and regulations framed under 
statutory powers shall be compiled in the form of a Code . This shall also 
contain a consolidated word index.  
(x)  A compendium of all statutory orders and no tifications shall be compiled  
and shall be made available to the  public at inexpensive prices .   
(xi)  A legislative  and/or administrative  regime shall be prepared with effective 
enforcement and prosecution mechanisms to ensure that  law publications 
for sale to the public are error free and, where applicable, have the 
permission of the Government owning copyrighted material.  CMA -4343/14 in SMC No.1/05  10
 (xii)  The Provinces shall follow the same pattern of publication of s oft and hard 
copies of laws, rules and notifications as has  been ordered for the 
Federation.         
18. The matter shall now be list ed for hearing on 17.02.2015  on which date the five 
Governments shall come prepared so that the Court can settle  timelines within which each 
of the directives and or ders in the preceding paragraph  shall be complied with. A copy of 
this judgment shal l be sent to the five Governments through their Chief Executives and 
Law Secretaries. A copy shall also be sent  to the Secretary of the Law and Justice 
Commission  (LJCP) with notice for 17.2.2015  so that within the mandate of the LJCP under 
the Law Commiss ion Ordinance, 1979, it can  monitor the work being done by the five 
Governments and ensure that the quality and usefulness of the publications to be made as 
ordered above,  are best suited for the public need.
