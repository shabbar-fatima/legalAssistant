Date of hearing:  01.07.2020.  
 
     ORDER  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Noor Bukhsh, 
petitioner herein, seeks admission to post arrest bail ; he had allegedly 
shot one Abdul Qayyum, way back on 29.9.2013  within the remit of 
Police Station  Gawadar  on his opposition  over an unauthorized gasoline 
outlet, managed by  him in the neighbourhood; fire shot injury on the 
spinal cord  finally resulted into the death, though after lapse of  almost 
six years . Section 324 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 , after injured’s 
death has been substituted with section 316 thereof . Repeated 
attempts for bail failed before the Courts below , last being  in the High 
Court  on 28.04.2020 on account of absence of a fresh ground .  
2.  Heard.  
3.  Petitioner stayed away from law for a period exceeding half 
a decade  and was finally arrested on 3.2.2020 ; being a fugitive from 
law, that too  for a pretty long period of time, he has disentitled himself 
to the concessions, ordinarily extended in discretion to an offender. 
While it is for the trial Court to determ ine the cause of death  and 
consequences thereof, the case initially set up in the crime report, 
supported by the statements of the witnesses and medical evidence  
constitutes ‘ reasonable grounds ’ within the contemplation of section Criminal Petition No.527 of 2020   
 2
497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898  with space  for further 
probe or inquiry in absence whereof , he cannot be released on bail even 
on that score . Petitioner’s last attempt in the High Court through a 
subsequent petition without any fresh ground has rightly been 
declin ed, calling for no interference  by this Court . Petition fails. Leave 
declined.
