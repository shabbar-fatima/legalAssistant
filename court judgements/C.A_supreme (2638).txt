ORDER  
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - On a tip off , the 
petitioner s were  intercepted by Anti -Narcotic Force contingent Jail Petition No.739 of 2018 and Criminal Petition No.1344 and 
1351 of 2018  
 2
within the precincts of Police Station  Rawat at 9/10:00 on 
10.10.2016 ; they were transporting a heavy consignment  of 
narcotics concealed  in different portions of a car ; the search led to 
discovery of ten packets of  contraband , wei ghing 10 -kg, 
surreptitiously placed in different cavities , forensically confirmed 
as cannabis; they were indicted by the learned Special Judge (CNS) 
Islamabad  who returned them a guilty verdict under Section 9(c) of 
the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997; sentenced to ten 
years rigorous imprisonment , they were directed to pay 
Rs.100,000/ - each as fine  or to undergo nine months simple 
imprisonment in lieu thereof, vide judgment dated 19.04.2018 ; 
their appeal failed before a learned Division Bench of th e 
Islamabad High Court vide impugned judgment dated 10.10.2018, 
vires whereof, are being assailed on a variety of grounds  ranging 
from false implication , discrepant statements of the witnesses , 
non-availability of support from the public  and a forensic rep ort 
with deficient protocols . The learned Law Officer faithfully defended 
the impugned judgment, according to him, the prosecution 
succeeded in proving the charge to the hilt beyond a shadow of 
doubt .  
2.  Heard. Record perused.  
3.  We have gone through th e evidence to find the 
witnesses in a substantial unison on all the details of the episode; 
petitioners’ joint arrest with the vehicle  they were travelling in  and 
seizure of contraband therefrom  are circumstances heavily 
looming  over their culpability. Fo rensic report substantially details  
the procedure adopted  by the analyst  to undertake the analysis , 
unambiguously confirming the narcotic character of the 
contraband , a conclusion that went unrebutted/unchallenged 
during the trial . Petitioners’  different b ackgrounds, converging in 
their illicit pursuit , the only common ground,  by itself confirms a 
collaboration in a purpose far from being usual or just. 
Inconsequential cross -examination and reticent denial s, in 
retrospect,  lend a  mute  support to  the prosecu tion in its quest to 
drive home the charge . In the totality of circumstances,  we are not 
persuaded to take a view other than the one concurrently taken by 
the Courts below. However, distinctly saddled with different 
quantities  of the contraband  by each con vict, ranging from  Jail Petition No.739 of 2018 and Criminal Petition No.1344 and 
1351 of 2018  
 3
2 to 5 k.g. , a case set up  by the prosecution itself , spells  out a 
makeshift  union instead of a concerted joint detour , therefore,  we 
are inclined  to proportionately mould the sentence . Consequently, 
while maintaining their convictio n, sentence awarded to them is 
reduced to a period of 5 -years R.I. with a corresponding reduction 
in the fine to the tune of Rs.50,000/ - each with 6-months S.I. in 
the event of default , a wage conscionable in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case . With the aforesaid modification, the 
petitions are converted into appeal and partly allowed.
