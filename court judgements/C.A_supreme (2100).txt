  ORDER  
   
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J. – Zahid Shah, 
18/19, was spotted dead on 17.1.2021 within the precincts of 
Police Station Landi Kotal , District Khyber; his uncle Shoqi 
Muhammad reported the incident to police  without mentioning the 
accused or motive for the crime.  Autopsy conducted at 10:45 a.m. 
on 18.1.2021 noted two firearm entry wounds  on the skull , 
inflicted within the preceding 9 to 18 hours;  as the inv estigation 
progressed, the petitioner was hauled up as a suspect  on the basis 
of statements of Iqrar Hussain and Roman PWs , recorded as late 
as on 29.1.2021; according to the witnesses, the petitioner  had 
borrowed a .30 caliber pistol which he subsequentl y returned  to 
them ; the pistol was produced by the witnesses to the police and it 
was forensically found wedded with the casing s, secured from the 
spot. The High Court considered the evidence, sufficient to Cr.P.73-P/2021  
  
   2
constitute “ reasonable grounds ” and declined bail  vide impugned 
order dated 19.03.2021 . 
2.  Heard. Record perused.  
3.  Be that as it may, the question as to whether .30 
caliber pistol  presented to the police by the prosecution witnesses , 
shown to have ejected casings  of the fatal shots  can be attributed 
to the petitioner so as to conclusively saddle him with the 
culpability of crime  in the absence of any other evidence  is 
certainly an issue that needs to be settled after recording of 
evidence . In the school leaving certificate, petitioner’s date of birth 
is recorded as 6.9.2004 , bringing his status within the remit of 
juvenility with concomitant concession s available to him under the 
law. Even otherwise, investigation being complete, petitioner’s 
continuous detention is not likely to improve upon prosecuti on’s 
case; a case for his release on bail stands made out. Petition is 
converted into appeal and allowed; the petitioner/appellant shall 
be released , pending his trial, upon furnishing bond in the sum of 
Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to t he satisfaction 
of the learned trial Court.
