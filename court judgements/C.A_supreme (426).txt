ORDER OF THE COURT  
  For the reasons to be recorded later and subject to 
amplifications and explanations made therein, by a majority of 6 to 1 
(Yahya Afridi,  J. dissenting) , it is decided and declared that : 
i. Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution  of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan (“Constitution”)  is not a self -executory provision as it 
does not by itself specify the court of law that is to make the 
declaration mentioned therein nor does it provide for any 
procedure for making, and any period for disqualification 
incurred by , such declaration.  
ii. There is no law that provides for the procedure, process  and 
the identification of the court of law for making the declaration 
mentioned  in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and the 
duration of such a declaration , for the purpose of 
disqualification  thereun der, to meet the requirements of the 
Fundamental Right to a fair trial and due process guaranteed 
by Article 10A of the Constitution . 
iii. The i nterpret ation of  Article  62(1)(f) of the Constitution in 
imposing  a life time disqual ification upon a person through an 
implied declaration of a court of civil jurisdiction  while 
adjudicating upon some civil rights and obligations of the 
parties  is beyond the scope of the said Article and amounts to 
reading  into the Constitution.  
iv. Such reading int o the Constitution is also  against the principle 
of harmonious interpretation of the provisions of the 
Constitution as it abridges the Fundamental R ight of citizens to 
contest elections and vote for a candidate of their choice 
enshrined in Article 17 of the Constitution , in the absence of 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law.  
v. Until a law is enacted to make its provisions executory,  Article 
62(1)(f) of the Constitution stands on a similar footing as Article 
62(1)(d), (e) and (g) , and serves as a guideline for  the voters  in 
exercising their right to vote.  
vi. The view taken in Sami  Ullah Baloch  v Abdul Karim 
Nausherwani (PLD 2018 SC 405)  treating the declaration made 
by a court of civil jurisdiction regarding breach of certain civil 
rights and obligations as a declaration men tioned in Article 
62(1)(f) of the Constitution and making such declaration to 
have a lifelong disqualifying effect amounts to reading in to the 
Constitution and is therefore overruled.  Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.

vii. Section 232(2) added in the Election s Act, 2017 , vide the 
Elections (Amendment) Act, 2023 promulgated on 26 June 
2023, prescribes a period of five years for the disqualification 
incurred by any ju dgment, order or decree of any c ourt in 
terms of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and has also made 
such declarati on subject to the due process of law. This 
provision is already in field , and there remains no need to 
examine its validity and scope in the present case . 
 2. Consequently, the present  civil appeals and petitions are  decided in 
the following terms:  
i. Civil A ppeal No. 982/2018  is allowed to the extent of the 
appellant’s disqualification to contest elections on the ground 
stated in the impugned order of the Lahore High Court , dated 6 
July 2018, passed in Writ Petition No. 22429/2018 , which to 
that extent is set  aside;  
ii. Civil Appeal No. 984/2018 , which has impugned the order of 
the Lahore High Court , dated 11 July 2018, p assed in Writ 
Petition No. 222868/2018 whereby the respondent’s 
nomination papers were ordered to be accepted and the 
Returning O fficer was directed to include his name (Fazal 
Mehmood) in the list of eligible candidates , is dismissed;  
iii. Civil Appeal No. 880/2015 , which has impugned  the 
judgment of the Election Tribunal, Multan, Punjab, dated 21 
August 2015, whereby the election of the appellant (Ch. 
Muhammad Arif Hussain ) as returned candidate in respect of 
General Elections held on 11 May 2013 was declared as void 
and the Election Commission of Pakistan was directed to hold 
fresh elections which were held and the term of the said 
assemblies has expired, is disposed of as having  become 
infructuous;  
iv. Civil Appeal No. 1946 /2023 , which has impugned the order 
of the  High Court  of Sindh,  dated 19 October 2023, passed in 
Constitution  Petition No.  1082/2023  whereby the appellant’s 
prayer for declaring him  to be eligible to contest the upcoming 
elections was disposed of with the observation that the same 
would be decided at the appropriate stage if his nomination 
papers were rejected, is disposed of in view of the above 
declarations ; and  
v. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2680/2023  is 
converted into an appeal and allowed to the extent of the 
appellant’s disqualification to contest elections on the ground 
stated in the impugned order of the Lahore High Court, dated 4 
May 2023, passed in Writ Petition No. 27043/2023 , which to 
that extent is set aside.   Civil Appeal No. 982/2018 etc.

3. Learned Syed Ali Imran, the Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar 
Association (‘ SCBA ’), stated that the SCBA sought  to withdraw C.M. Appeal 
No. 22/2022  and Constitution Petition filed in 202 2, which was under 
objection and not numbered, therefore, the said appeal and petition are 
dismissed as withdrawn. Civil Appeal s No. 981 & 985/2018 , CM Appeal 
No. 135/2022 in C.P.  No. NIL/2022  and Constitution Petition No. 40 of 
2022  are de-listed, which  shall be posted for hearing separately  before 
appropriate Benches .

 Yahya Afridi, J.  - With profound respect, I disagree. For reasons to 
follow, the extent of lack of qualification of a member of the Parliament, as 
envisaged under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, is neither lifelong nor permanent, and the same shall 
remain effective only during the period the declaration so mad e by a Court 
of law remains in force. Therefore, the conclusion so drawn by this Court in 
Sami Ullah Baloch Versus Abdul Karim Nousherwani (PLD 2018 SC 405) is 
legally valid, hence affirmed.
