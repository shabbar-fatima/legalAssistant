O R D E R  
 
 
Ms. Samina Khawar Hayat : 
The Election Commission of Pakistan  (ECP)  vide CMA 
No.3470 of 2013 had stated that Higher Education Commission 
(HEC) decla red the degree of Ms. Samina Khawar Hayat as 
fake/bogus whereas the ECP in CMA No.4055 /2013  had filed the 
following statement , which has been reproduced herein below: - 
“7) That it is brought to the notice of this Hon’ble Court 
that overall outcome of the v erification process was 
communicated to the Election Commission of Pakistan dated 
06.04.2013. However as far as the case of the Samina 
Khawar Hayat is concerned, she has made an application 
stating that in fact her degree issued by the PIMSAT dated  3 
25.09.2 006 is genuine which had been verified by the Higher 
Education Commission on 23.12.2010 whereafter, it was 
found, it is most humbly submitted, that earlier a degree in 
the name of Samina Saleem of BBA shown to have been 
issued by the Riphah International U niversity was declared 
fake to which she had disowned before the Election 
Commission of Pakistan and favourable order was passed in 
her favour on 13.03.2012 by ECP as she had produced a 
degree from PIMSAT issued on September 25, 2006 which 
was attested and  verified by HEC on 23.12.2010 and now 
she has been allowed to participate in the recent election by 
the Election Tribunal, Lahore High Court, Lahore vide order 
dated 15.04.2013. (Annexure “G”).”  
 
  It is to be noted that along with CMA  No.4336/2013 , which  
has been filed by the ECP, the Nomination Papers to all other 
persons whose degrees have been verified are available but the 
Nomination Papers of Ms. Samina Khawar Hayat has not been 
filed. In such view of the matter, a precise question for 
consideration would be as to whether she relied upon a degree 
dated 25.9.2006 which was considered to be a fake on 
23.12.2010. Subsequent thereto , it appears that this degree was in 
the name of one Samina Aslam, therefore, she disowned it and 
stated that she has passed BBA from the Pre ston University and 
degree was issued in her favour on 25.9.2008, which was attested 
and verified by the HEC on 23.2.2012. In such view of the 
matter, we direct the Election Commission of Pakistan to place 
on record her nomination papers wh ich she submitted during the  4 
Election of 2008 as well as 2013 on the basis of which she has 
been returned as a successful candidate. Let the Election 
Commission of Pakistan do the needful by tomorrow i.e. 
9.7.2013. Similarly, the HEC is directed to place o n record the 
original record so as to verify the genuineness  or otherwise of the 
degree.

  As far as the case of Raja Shoukat Aziz Bhatti is 
concerned , according to the HE C, the degree relied upon by him

Mak hdoom Syed Ali Raza Shah
