2.  The case of Sheikh Zayed Medical Complex, 
Lahore  (“SZMC”) , is relatively simple and straightforward . 
Our attention has been drawn to its constitutive instrument s 
including the trust deed through which it was  established. It  
clearly and unambiguously provide s that the main purpose 
for setting up SZMC was for research and professional and 
technical training  of doctors and related medical staff . That 
being the case, we are in no manner of doubt that the case of 
the SZMC  is clearly covered under Entry No.16 of the Federal 
Legislative List. Further, the SZMC  has been transferred by 
the Federal Government without due application of mind, 
examining the constitutional position and without following 
the necessary legal procedure s.  
 
3.  The case of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center , 
Karachi (“JPMC”);  National Institute of Cardiovascular 
Diseases, Karachi  (“NICVD”);  National Institute of Child 
Health, Karachi  (“NICH ”), and National Museum of Pakistan, 
Karachi (“NMP”)  also shows complete lack and absence of 
application of mind on the part of the Federal Government . 
The requisite legal procedure s were not followed. T he real 
intent, import and impact of the Eighteenth Constitutional 
Amendment  was ignored and misinterpreted .  
 
4.  We are conscious of the fact that there is a balance of 
powers between the Federation and the Provinces as spelt by the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which 
grants provincial autonomy in specified areas. The provincial 
autono my granted by the Constitution deserves the highest respect 
and is sacrosanct. However, at the same time, a declaration to the CIVIL APPEALS NO.125 -K TO 131 -K AND 2306 TO 23 09 OF 2016 AND CIVIL MISC. APPLICATIONS  
NO.1254 -K AND 8973 OF 2018 AND CIVIL PETITION 2312 -L OF 2018

effect that the aforenoted Institutions have been transferred by the 
Federal Government to the Provinces without following due pr ocess 
of law, application of mind and in a mechanical manner does not 
by any stretch of the imagination impinges upon or encroaches the 
provincial autonomy granted by the Constitution.  
 
5.  In the above context, the contents of Entry No.37 of 
the Federal Legislative List are also significant. These permit the 
Federal Government to undertake projects in any of the Federating 
Units for its purposes. However, in such circumstances, the 
Provinces have full authority to perform the executive  and 
regulatory func tion. They can enact and enforce legislation 
involving such projects and implement and enforce the same 
within its territorial limits. This judgment , however,  does not in 
any manner obstruct, deny or curtail the power of the Federal 
Government to transfer any project, works, lands or buildings 
owned and controlled by it to any of the Provinces. However, such 
transfer must be undertaken in accordance with law, through a 
legal instrument specifying the terms and conditions on the basis 
of which such transfer is to take place and the nature and 
duration of such transfer.  
 
6.  We find that the power of the Federation to set up, run 
and operate projects including hospitals and related research 
facilities where enforcement of fundamental rights is involved is an 
obligation of the Federal Government under the Constitution. In 
the instant case, enforcement of right to life is involved which is 
one of the most fundamental of the fundamental rights. To curtail 
or circumscribe the power of the Federal Government to enf orce 
Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution would be 
anathema for the concept of Federalism. The performance of its 
positive obligation s under the fundamental rights , for example right CIVIL APPEALS NO.125 -K TO 131 -K AND 2306 TO 23 09 OF 2016 AND CIVIL MISC. APPLICATIONS

to life, prevention of slavery, forced labour, human traffic king, etc 
constitute a “purpose ” of the Federation for which it can carry out 
projects through out Pakistan. For performance of the said 
purpose, it is not necessary to look into the legislative list when the 
main body of the Constitution provides the requi site powers.  Refer 
to Province of Sindh v. MQM  (PLD 2014 SC 531 ). We however reiterate 
that in doing so in the territorial jurisdiction of a Province, the 
projects and institutions of the Federal Government shall be 
subject to the Provincial Laws and regul atory control. 
Consequently, neither the legislative nor executive authority of the 
Provinces in relation to the subject of hospitals is encroached 
upon.  
 
7.  While upholding and reiterating the declarations 
and orders passed in the impugned judgment, we declare as 
follows: - 
i. Transfer/devolution of SZMC , JPMC , NICVD , NICH , 
and NMP is declared to be unconstitutional, without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect;  
ii. All acts done or orders, directions, notifications and 
directives issued  or made pursuant to t he purported 
transfer / devolution or to give effect to the same in 
any manner whatsoever , which are inconsistent with 
or in derogation of the tenor of this order to the extent 
of inconsistency  are declared to be without lawful 
authority and of no legal ef fect; 
iii. Within 90 days of this judgment, the Federal and 
Provincial Governments and all related Departments 
shall take all necessary steps relating to return of the 
aforenoted Institutions from the Provinces to the 
Federation. The position of these Instituti ons shall as 
far as possible be restored to the position as on the 
date when they were transferred to the Provinces. It 
is, however, clarified that the restoration and return 
as aforesaid shall include resumption of the 
employees by the Federation in relat ion to the 
Institutions and all serving or retired officers, 
employees or servants thereof. In case, the aforesaid CIVIL APPEALS NO.125 -K TO 131 -K AND 2306 TO 23 09 OF 2016 AND CIVIL MISC. APPLICATIONS

exercise cannot be completed within the aforenoted 
period of 90 days and an extension is required, any of 
the Governments can move appropriat e application 
before this Court seeking extension for reasons spelt 
out in the application;  
 
iv. Till such time as the aforesaid exercise is completed, 
all matters relating to the Institutions shall continue on 
the same basis as on the date of this judgment 
including but not limited to financial and budgetary 
matters, disbursement, outlays and expenditures 
including disbursement relating to payment of 
salaries, pensions and related matters;  
 
v. All ongoing projects/contracts in which partial 
payments have been m ade shall be taken over by the 
Federation and balance payments shall be made by 
it. However, all contracts completed within  the past 
one year and equipment supplied in the same period 
which had actually arrived at the Institutions or in the 
process of bein g supplied or has already been 
installed shall be paid for/reimbursed to the Provinces 
by the Federation;  
 
vi. In case, the Federation and any of the Provinces are 
unable to resolve any matter, with regard to 
compensation or payments to be made, the same shal l 
be deemed to be a dispute between the Provinces and 
the Federation. In that case, the aggrieved party shall 
be entitled to seek its remedy in accordance with the 
Constitution and the law;  
vii. All statutory instruments including Acts and 
Ordinances passed or issued in relation to the 
aforenoted Institutions shall stand suspended. 
Nothing in the Provincial Laws shall in any manner 
hinder, restrict or impede or otherwise affect the 
return of any of the aforenoted Institutions to the 
Federation;  
viii. A committee shal l immediately be constituted for 
working out the modalities for smooth, trouble free 
and seamless transition and transfer of the 
aforenoted Institutions from the Provinces to the 
Federation and to deal with and make 
recommendations regarding all aspects of  such 
transfer including terms and conditions               
of employment, seniority, assimilation,  etc  in the CIVIL APPEALS NO.125 -K TO 131 -K AND 2306 TO 23 09 OF 2016 AND CIVIL MISC. APPLICATIONS

service of the Federation and all other matters 
directly, indirectly or incidentally relating to the 
same. In case, a need arises, the Federal 
Government shall initiate  such legislation as may 
be necessary for the effective completion and 
operation of the aforenoted Institutions; and  
 
ix. The Federal Government shall also allocate and 
disburse such funds as may be necessary to 
maintain the level of s ervices being provided in 
the aforenoted Institutions presently and to 
progressively improve the environment and 
running  of all Institutions in a more efficient, 
effective and patient friendly manner.

  Maqbool Baqar, J. - I have had the privilege of going 
through the short order authored by my brother Ijazul Ahsan , J., 
but have not been able to persuade myself to concur with the 
same, however beca use of extreme paucity of time I am unable to 
write a note containing my reasons for disagreement , and for now 
would only state that Pakistan is a Federal Republic. Our 
constitution has conferred certain enumerated powers on the 
federal government and the residuary powers on the provinces. The 
very spirit and essence of a Federal Constitution is the distribution 
of legislative powers between the federa tion and the provinces. The 
subject of public health and public hospital s has throughout our 
legislative hi story remained exclusively with the provinces. 
Sometime by enumeration in the provincial legislative list , and at 
times by way of residuary power s, and have never been with the 
federation. Under the 1973 Constitution also, which now , as a 
consequence of th e 18th Constitutional Amendment , contains only 
one legislative list, being federal legislative list, also confers such 
power s and authority on the provinces, as the same again do not 
find place in the federal list , and therefore the subject s of public 
health and public hospitals fall within the legislative competence 
and executive authority of the provinces only .The federal 
legislature undoubtedly lacks legislative competence and executive 
authority in relation to the said subject s. Article 142(c) clearly 
prohibits the parliament from legislating on the subjects not 
mentioned in the Federal legislative list.  
  Indeed the Federal Legislative List through entry No.37 
mentions “works, lands and buildings ”, vested in , or in possession 
of federal government for t he “purposes ” of Federation as federal 
subject s, however, such property and assets , as is obvious from 
the language of the said entry itself , should be catering for federal 
purposes and not for those of the provinces , and as noted CIVIL APPEALS NO.125 -K TO 131 -K AND 2306 TO 23 09 OF 2016 AND CIVIL MISC. APPLICATIONS  
NO.1254 -K AND 8973 OF 2018 AND CIVIL PETITION 2312 -L OF 2018

earlier ,public health and  public hospital exclusively being 
provincial subject s, any of their facility/asset cannot be deemed as 
for federal “ purposes ” and can by no stretch of imagination be 
treated as federal subject s. The relevance and significance of the 
“purpose ”attributed to  any property and/or asset is evident from 
the provisions of Article 274 of the present constitution which 
provides that all properties and assets , which on the 
commencement of the constitution , vested in the federal 
government , shall, in case they, on the  commenc ing day,were to be 
used for the “purposes” of a provincial government, shall become 
properties of the said provincial government.  
  From the reading of entry 37 , and Article 274 , it 
becomes abundantly clear that for vesting , even of properties and  
assets, the “purpose ” catered for by such properties and assets is 
crucially relevant. It may be significant to no te here that 
article ssimilar to Article 274 of the Constitution of 1973 , are 
available in all of our earlier constitutions.  
Our constitution prescribes well laid down role and 
limits of every organ of the State. Whereas Article 142(c) expressly 
curtails the limits of the Federal Legislat ure/Government ,which 
needs to be respected.Inorder to maintain and preserve the federal 
nature of our constit ution , our effort should be to interpret the 
constitutional provisions so as to preserve the provincial autonomy 
rather than to dilute the same.
