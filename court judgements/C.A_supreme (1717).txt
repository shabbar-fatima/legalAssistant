that he was appointed as the Advisor upon the desire  of the Prime Minister 
and not by  his own choice . It is also true that he had been Court -martialed  
upon the allegations of insubo rdination and not on account of any moral 
turpitude  and further that he has resigned as the CEO of Royal Airport

Attorney General for Pakistan shall place on re cord the notification of the 
acceptance of his resignation in due course of time.
