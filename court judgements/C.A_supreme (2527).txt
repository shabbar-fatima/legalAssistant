ORDER  
 
  Mr. Muhammad Safdar, Project Director (Machine Readable 
Passport s), Immigration & Passport Department  submits that the office is in 
receipt of the applications of 7500 overseas Pakistanis who are held up in 
China because of non -availability of Machine Readabl e Passports in Pakistan 
Embassy in China. He added that the machine was installed in February, 2013 , 
however, it is not operational on account of non -appointment of the technical 
officer which is a grade -17 post. Adds on Court query that a reference was se nt 
to Ministry of Interior in July, 2013; that 4/5 reminders were issued but the 
Ministry has not issued the requisite appointment order because the said 
Ministry has sent the reference to the Prime Minister Secretariat and on 
account of the general ban im posed, no further action could be taken.  
 
2.  We are surprised and rather dismayed over the insensitive attitude 
of the passport department. However, before we pass any order, we are 
persuaded to direct Secretary Interior to appear in Court on 19. 02.2014 and 
explain the factual position.
