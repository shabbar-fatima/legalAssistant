O R D E R 
  This matter was taken up on 02.02.2012 , when an application 
was moved on behalf of petitioner  by Mr. Raza Kazim, Sr. ASC , inter alia , 
with the p rayer to initiate proceedings of contempt of Court against the 
respondents for the reasons mentioned in the application and in the 
meantime direct them not to take further steps in arbitration and instead 
withdr aw the request of arbitration at the ICCA and  ICSID, till th is Court 
decides the matter on the legalities and validity of the joint venture 
agreement s. 
2.  Mr. Khalid Anwar, Sr. ASC states that ‘TCCA’ is an 
independent body corporate, having no concern with instant proceedings.  
3.  Learned Advocate G eneral Balochistan controvert this fact 
and made reference to alliance agreement between the BHP Minerals 
International Exploration Inc. and TCCA dated 03.04.2002, to substantiate 
that ‘TCCP’ and ‘TCCA’ are component of one company and that now 
‘TCCA’ has approached ICC and ICSID for arbitration . To elaborate his CP.796/2007, etc.  4 
submission, he has made reference to the following title of the agreement 
dated 03.04.2002 :- 
  “BETWEEN : 
BHP MINERALS INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION INC.  a 
corporation of the State of Delaware, USA of S uite 500, 1360 Post Oak 
Blvd. Houston, Texas, USA  
 
AND  
 
TETHYAN COPPER COMPANY LIMITED ABN  24 093 519 692 
of level 1, 1 Havelock Street, West Perth, Western Australia.”   
 
4.  It may be noted that subsequent  thereto another innovation 
agreement dated 01.04. 2006 was arrived at between Government of 
Balochistan, BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. and Tethyan 
Copper Company Ltd ., Australia . Title of the same is as under: - 
  “BETWEEN : 
 
THE GOVERNOR OF BALOCHISTAN, for and on behalf of the 
Province of Ba lochistan, in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (“GOB”) 
acting through its agent THE BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT 
AUTHORITY , a statutory corporation created by and existing under 
the Balochistan Development Authority Act 1974 (“ BDA ”) 
 
AND  
 
BHP MINERALS INTERNAT IONAL EXPLORATION INC.  a 
corporation incorporaqted in Delaware of Suite 500, 1360 Post Oak 
Blvd. Houston, Texas, USA  (“BHPB ”) 
 
AND  
 
TETHYAN COPPER COMPANY LIMITED (ABN  24 093 519 
692) a company incorporated in Australia of level 1, 1 Havelock Street, 
West Perth, Western Australia. (“TCC ”)”  
  
5.  Mr. Khalid Anwar, learned Sr. ASC , however , has opposed 
the grant of stay and contended that whatever status both the companies i.e. 
‘TCCP’ or ‘TCCA’ may  enjoy but ‘TCCA’  is not represented by any one of 
them and an y order passed by this Court in this regard is likely to cause 
further legal complications domestically and internationally , as well.   
6.  We have heard both the sides and have considered the request 
so made by M/s Raza Kazim, Sr. ASC, Ahmer Bilal Sufi, AS C and 
Advocate General Balochistan and have taken into consideration the fact 
that the Government of Balochistan is being insisted for appointment of the 
Arbitrator ; therefore,  we direct to the Government of Balo chistan as well as CP.796/2007, etc.  5 
Government of Pakistan to  make a request to the ICC and ICSID 
Washington D.C. not to take further steps and extend the period for 
nomination of the Arbitrator, so that in the meantime this Court, which is 
already seized of the matter since the year 2007 and is hearing the  petition s 
filed subsequently on the same subject under the Constitutional provisions, 
may dispose of the same finally.  
  Adjourned to a date in office after two weeks.
