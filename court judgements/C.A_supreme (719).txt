  GULZAR AHMED, CJ. -  
  C.M.A. No.5602 of 2021 : The one man Commission 
has filed this application with the prayer that the allocation of 
funds be made to it because  earlier funds  of Rs.7 million allocated 
to it vide order dated 19.02.2020 , has already  been spent and 
rather some liabilities have also  accrued . In the application, the 
Commission has prayed for granting of an amount of Rs.14.99 4 
million for clearance of outstanding liabilities and also for 
allocation  of budget for the year 2021 -2022. Notic e of this 
application be issued Ministry of Religious  Affair and Inter faith 
Harmony  and also to the Attorney General for Pakistan. In the 
meanwhile, the amount of Rs.14.994 million be disbursed to the 
Commission . For allocation of new budget, l et a proper response 
be filed by the Ministry of Religious  Affairs and Interfaith 
Harmony . We, however, be noted that one man  Commission shall 
ensure to maintain  proper accounts for the moneys disbursed to it 
and spent by it for the purpose of implementation of the 
Commission.  
2.  The learned counsel for the applic ant in Civil Misc. 
Application No.4821 of 2018, states that the very Commission 
created by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith 
Harmony  is not in accordance with law for the reasons that it has 
been constituted through an executive order and no law to 
support such a Commission has been passed. She contends that 
the function ing of the Commission constituted by the Ministry is, C.M.A.5602/21 , etc - 4 - 
   therefore, not legal and the Ministry should ensure that the 
Commission b e constituted with proper s upport of law. Let 
submissions on  such point s be made on the next date of hearing. 
Adjourned to a date after the summer vacations.  
3.  Dr. Ramesh Kumar, Co-opted Member of the 
Commission, states that the property on Plot No.3 2, NP-04 Napier 
Quarter s Saddar  Town -I, Karachi, measuring about 716 Sq. Yards 
was a Dharam Shala and placed before the Court photographs of 
such building , which is being demolished for making way for a 
new construction of a commercial plaza. He states th at this 
property  has been leased out by the Evacuee Trust Property Board 
to some private person and he  is in the process of demolish ing the 
Dharam Shala and raising of a new building. It is stated by the 
Chairman, Evacuee Trust Property Board that the matter 
regarding the very Dharam Shala has been decided by the High 
Court of Sindh, where it has allowed the Evacuee Trust Property 
Board to lease  it out, have it demolished and rais ed new 
construction. Such an order of the High Court of Sindh is  not 
before us. Th e very photograph apparently shows that the 
building is of Dharam Shala  constructed in the ye ar 1932, which 
can be read from the marble sl ab affixed on the building and  must 
be a  protected heritage building. Let notice be issued to the 
Secretary  Heritage, Government of Sindh to file its report 
regarding the building. In the mean time, no demolition activity of 
the said building shall be conducted by anyone and possess ion of 
the building and the land shall be taken over by the 
Commissioner Karachi, who shall manage  the same and not allow C.M.A.5602/21 , etc - 5 - 
   any person to enter upon it. No demolished material shall be 
allowed  to be removed . This be done by the Commissioner Karachi 
today and report, in this respect, be submitted to the Office  of the 
Supreme Court . The office of thi s Court shall communicate  this 
order to the Commissioner Karachi, today.
