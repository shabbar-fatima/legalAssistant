present illness.  
2.  The learned AOR submits that the application for 
adjournment was filed directly by the learned counsel. 
Consequently, he has no instruction s in the matter and is not 
prepared  with arguments in the case. In the circumstances, 
we are not inclined to adjourn this matter  as it has not  CP NO. 4899 OF 2018  2
