2.   We have objected on the inclusion o f difference between the average 
prescribed price of natural gas A  to D and F, difference of which comes to Rs.15.68 for 
Region -1 and Rs.14.3 for Region -II w.e.f. 22nd October, 2012 respectively as well as on 
the operating cost of CNG stations, profit of C NG Station Owners , noted hereinabove 
because in absence of any statutory provision OGRA  is not authorized  to fix the 
operating costs and profit of the operators of CNG Stations , arbitrarily . Similarly, on 
the issue of linkage between the price of the CNG a nd petrol price , which comes to 
Rs.9.55 and Rs.17.48 per kg, respectively.  We have observed that price of CNG legally 
cannot be linked with the price of petrol. It is also to be noted that the prices of CNG 
are being fixed on weekly basis , in pursuance of the decision of ECC dated 7th August, 
2012 , copy of which has also been placed on record. When we inquired from the 
Secretary Petroleum he candidly conceded that CNG is not covered under the 
definition of petroleum products. W e asked him to explain as to w hy the prices  of 
CNG are being revised on weekly basis , he answered that in this behalf a resolution 
has also been passed by the National Assembly that the prices of petrol products etc . 
may not be determined on weekly basis but so far no decision has been  taken in the 
ECC. For such reasons the Secretary Petroleum promised on 24.10.2012,  to look into 
all these aspects of the matter. Accordingly today, a statement has been filed by him, 
which is reproduced  as under: - 
 “1. The undersigned, Waqar Masood Khan,  Secretary, Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Resources, in pursuance of the orders of the Hon’ble 
Court, after the hearing on 24.10.2012 respectfully submits as follows: - 
1. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Resources will expend additional efforts to ensure 
that domestic and life -line consumer’s interests 
in matters of gas pricing are fully protected;  
2. In particular, in the case of pricing of CNG, the 
arrangement evolved for linking it with the price 
of petrol on weekly basis will be abandoned.  
3. The Cost of Gas for the CNG sector will be 
adjusted only after the determination of 
prescribed price by OGRA as per law.  Const. P.33/05, etc.  
 4 
4. With immediate effect, the price will be brought 
to the level that was fixed for CNG sector 
subsequent to the determination of price by 
OGRA for  the six months beginning 1.7.2012.  
5. The MOU through which Government and CNG 
Associations had agreed on a formula for 
operating cost of CNG stations will be 
immediately suspended and OGRA will develop 
a new formula after seeking information about 
the avail ability of gas, linkages with alternate 
fuel, discussion s with all stakeholders and after 
scrutiny of audited accounts of CNG stations as 
per rules.  
6. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Resources pursuant to the Resolution of the 
National Assembly has al ready moved a 
Summary to the Cabinet [ECC] as per rules for 
the review of the decision to adjust petroleum 
prices on weekly basis thus paying due respect to 
the Reso lution of the National Assembly. It has 
already communicated to OGRA not to increase 
the pr ice on weekly basis till the decision of the 
ECC as per law.  
2. Further, a copy of the Resolution of the National Assembly 
regarding monthly adjustment of prices is placed at 
Annexure -1.  
3. Additionally, a copy of the Petroleum Policy 2001 as desired 
during th e hearing is also enclosed.  
 
Waqar Masood Khan  
Secretary, Petroleum  
and Natural Resources.  
            25.10.2012”  
3.  On our inquiry he stated that the prices of CNG shall be brought to the 
level that was fixed for CNG Sector after determin ing the  price by OGRA for the six 
months starting from  1.7.2012 and that the MOU through which Government and 
CNG Associations had agreed on a formula for operating cost of CNG stations will be 
immediately suspended and OGRA will develop a new formula after seeking full  
information about the availability of gas, linkages with alternate fuel,  discussion with 
stakeholders and after scrutiny of audited accounts  of CNG Stations as per rules , thus, 
prices of CNG shall be reduce d, approximately , to the extent of Rs .20/- per k. g.  
4.   We have also expressed our reservations in respect of GDS/cross 
subsidization as mentioned in para F of the above reproduced chart . The  OGRA in Const. P.33/05, etc.  
 5 
exercise of its powers under Section 8 (1) and (2) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002   shall 
oblige to determi ne estimate of total revenue requirement of each licensee for natural 
gas engaged in transmission, distribution and the sale of natural gas to a retail 
consumer for natural gas, in accordance with th e rules and on basis of such advice  the 
Federal Governmen t shall prescribe  price of natural gas for each category of retail 
consumer for natural gas  under section 8(3) of the OGRA Ordinance . Therefore, there 
must be a rationale for charging the difference noted hereinabove. The Secretary 
Petroleum has pointed ou t that this is a surcharge being recovered from the consumers 
in accordance with Section 8 (5) of the ORGRA Ordinance, 2002. His this statement is 
not acceptable at this point of time. On this h e requested for some time to ponder over 
these issue s and to r each at an acceptable conclusion .   
5.  Mr. Ghayas Peracha, a representative of the CNG Station Owners ha s 
also pointed out a number of objections regarding fixation of the CNG Prices without 
any rationale.  
6.   We have noticed that on account of non disc harging of functions in 
accordance with law by the Authority there have been a lot of objections from one side 
or the other, however, we adjourn this matter with direction to the Chairman OGRA to 
fix the price of CNG after taking into consideration the sta tement in writing filed by 
the Government through its Secretary as well as discussion made hereinabove.  
    Let the matter be listed for further proceedings on 1st November, 2012.
