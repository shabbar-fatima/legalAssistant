ORDER  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Nasir Abbas alias 
Nasiri, tried alongside acquitted co-accused for homicide , was returned 
a guilty verdict  by the trial Court vide judgment  dated 30.04.2011, 
upheld , albeit with alteration of death penalty,  vide impugned 
judgment dated 23.01.2017 , vires whereof , are being assailed through 
Jail Petition No.255 of 2017, barred by 41 days , condoned in the 
interest of justice. It is alleged that on the fateful day i.e. 07.08.2008, 
within the precincts of Police Station  Saray Sidhu District Khanewal , 
with a view to restrain him from deposing in a murder case, he  
repeatedly shot Muhammad Aslam, deceased, accompanied by 
companions that included his son Muhammad Aamir P W; co-accused 
were blamed for conspiracy as well as facilitation . 
 Mr. Muhammad Sharif Janjua, ASC, at State expense, contends 
that there is inordinate delay between the occurrence and postmortem 
examination , suggesting the incident being an un -witnessed affair, 
details whereof, were discovered and deliberated subsequently ; while 
highlighting the role assigned to the acquitted co -accused, he argued 
that though somewhat  inconsequential, nonetheless, was indivi sible 
inasmuch as two of them had allegedly clutched the deceased before he Jail Petition No.255 of 2017  2
was repeatedly shot on the opposite sides of his body  and, thus, 
prosecution ’s failure qua the co -accused goes a long way to tremor the 
entire structure ; he has further referred to  massive improvements in 
graduation of number of accused as well as manner of occurrence to 
argue that it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction particularly in 
the backdrop of ongoing blood feuds inter se  the parties. Leave to 
appeal is granted to app raise entire evidence to ensure safe 
administration  of criminal justice.
