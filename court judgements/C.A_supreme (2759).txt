ORDER  
 
 Jawwad S. Khawaja, CJ.   The previous orders in this case set out 
the reasons why this matter has been taken up in our jurisdiction under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution.  Today we have heard learned counsel 
representing the parties mentioned above.   
 
2. It is admitted by the learned counsel for the Defence Housing 
Authority (“DHA”) , Lahore that DHA took over possession of land 
measuring 156.05 kanals knowing fully well that the persons from whom 
possession was taken inter-alia in lieu of  Rs.92,00,000/ - (ninety -two lakhs SMC 11/2015  2 
rupees) did not have title and that the said persons were embro iled in 
litigation with a lady, namely, Nusrat Jahan.  The said land in question, 
however, is statedly in an area known as Phase -VII, DHA, Lahore.  
According to learned counsel DHA does takes over possession of land 
against cash payment even where title is not with the person who delivers 
possession or even when title is disputed.   An advertisement has been 
placed before us showing that plots in Phase -VII are being allotted.  
However, there is no disclosure at all that DHA has no title in at least  the 
afores aid land in Phase VII or the said land is under  litigation.  Plots are 
being advertised for allotment and people are making payments to DHA 
notwithstanding this situation.  
 
3. The learned Prosecutor General, Punjab has also informed us that 
criminal invest igation is being undertaken in case FIR No. 544/2015 
dated 12.5.2015 registered at PS Defence -A, Lahore  to ascertain possible 
culpability  of those who may be invo lved.  The Investigating Officer has 
issued a questionnaire  containing 9 questions addressed t o the DHA.  The 
questions of Investigating Officers are as under:

The answers to the above questions from the DHA are as under:  
 
“1. DHA stance is as under: - 
a. DHA acquires land or possessor rights through contractual 
arrangements and law permits such rights under the 
transfer of Property Act. Even, rights in the property which 
are contingent and subject to happening of a condition are 
recognized under the Transfer of Property Act.  
b. DHA has only acquired possession of the area as it falls 
within the planned area of DHA Phase -VII. DHA has never 
claimed acquisition of ownership. No Sale Deed has been 
executed just possession money has been given. The 
significance of possession has been acknowledged under 
section 53 -A of the Transfer of Property Act.  
c. DHA cannot determine the legal ity or genuineness of any 
revenue document, if it’s interpolated or changed it is for 
the court to declare it void. Dr Usman has filed a suit in 
2004 and claimed rights in the property, wherein a stay 
has been granted. If a stay has been granted it confirm s 
existence of rights in the property. The question of 
cancellation of mutation is subject to the determination of 
the litigation. A reference is made to the principle of Lis 
Pendens.  
d. That the legal heirs of Mohammad Usman deceased 
claimed ownership on  the basis of Mutation No.142 and 
possession on the basis of the copies of record of Khasra 
Girdawari. That factum of possession / ownership was SMC 11/2015  4 
apparently verified in the judicial proceedings through the 
appointment of local commission, appointed to verif y 
certain facts including the factum of possession of the 
land. That one of the legal heir of the deceased has also 
installed / established a factory unit at the portion of the 
land, which was there when possession was taken by DHA 
Lahore. An electricity b ill reiterated the factum of existence 
of factory and possession of the legal heirs. The 
consideration paid by DHA also includes compensation for 
the factory / construction existed.  
e. It is evident from the documents that DHA has sought 
possession and no t ownership, which is subject to 
determination. And any expression used inadvertently to 
refer to ownership  doesn’t make DHA or Dr Usman owner?  
f. That DHA Lahore paid possession money to Syed Aittaz 
Hussain son of Syed Ijaz Hussain, who was nominated / 
appointed by the legal heirs of Mohammad Usman Khan 
for signing / execution of various documents and to receive 
payment of Rs.9,285,941/ - on their behalf, which was paid 
vide Cheque No.962952 dated 3rd July, 2007.  
g. DHA is interested to get some right in th e land to avoid 
exploitation at later stage. Upon determination of the 
ownership land would be acquired through execution of 
sale dee d and payment of compensation.”    
 
4. We may note that in the case titled Hamid Mir v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (2013 SCMR 18 80) we had held that after the eighteenth 
amendment and the changes brought about in Articles 169 to 171 of the 
Constitution it is now the responsibility of the Auditor General of Pakistan 
to audit of the accounts of the Federal and of the Provincial Gover nments 
and the accounts of any authority or body established by, or unde r the 
control of  the Federal or a Provincial Government . Such audit is to  be 
conducted by the Auditor -General, who shall determine the extent and 
nature of such audit.  Although in ter ms of our aforesaid judgment Hamid 
Mir v. Federation of Pakistan  (2013 SCMR 1880) it is for the Auditor 
General to audit the accounts of DHA which has been established by the 
Federal Government  by the Chief Executive’s Order of 2002 , we were SMC 11/2015  5 
informed that no audit by the Auditor -General has take n place and DH A is 
claiming immunity from audit by the Auditor General.  
 
5. The learned Prosecutor General also stated before us that the civil 
court which was dealing with litigation relating to the above referred l and 
measuring 156.05 kanals has passed an order of status -quo on 2.4.2004 . 
Notwithstanding this situation the DHA in 2006  proceeded to take 
possession of the said land by payment of a sum of Rs.92 lakhs to persons 
who were in possession of the same.  On a question posed by the Court, it 
becam e apparent that there is in fact no transfer of title in favour of DHA 
and there is no written agreement whereunder the aforesaid amount of 
Rs.92 lakhs has been paid to the persons from whom possession has 
purportedly b een taken by DHA.  From our hearing today it appears that 
this is not an isolated incident involving DHA.  
 
6. Mr. Shahid Hamid, ASC has drawn our attention to the fact that 
DHA Lahore started as the Lahore Cantt. Cooperative Housing Society in 
1975 having b een incorporated as such under the Cooperative Societies 
Act 1975.  It retained that status until 1999 when in September of that 
year the Defence Housing Authority Lahore Ordinance was promulgated 
by the Government of the Punjab .  Thereafter in 2002 Chief Executive ’s 
Order No.26 of 2002 was passed.  Prima facie  there appear  to be serious 
constitutional and legal issues as to the vires of these instruments.  
Consequently there are a number of issue s which arise under the 
Constitution including questions as t o excessive and untrammeled powers 
being vested in a body which appears to be a commercial enterprise  and 
which remains  unaudited .  Consequently, we have been informed that the 
said body, i.e. DHA has issued Notification s on its own in  respect of  areas 
which fall within the domain/jurisdiction of the Province and of local 
governments.  The said N otification s include provisions whereby penal SMC 11/2015  6 
consequences are imposed on individuals for violating the instructions 
issued by this private organization, namely, DH A.  Mr. Shahid Hamid also 
pointed out that according to his understanding the fundamental rights 
given in Article s 23 and 24 of the Constitution have also been violated by 
the aforesaid Notification.  The notification and the map showing notified 
areas ha ve been submitted in Court which have been placed on record.  
 
7. While we have to consider and decide the issues as to vires and 
constitutionality of the aforesaid instruments, i.e. the DHA Ordinance 
1999 and the Chief Executive ’s Order 26 of 2002, it is al so necessary to 
take note of the matters which relate to 156.05 kanals of land mentioned 
above  and vast tracts of other areas included in the aforesaid notification 
which have neither been acquired or taken on lease by DHA .  We may also 
record that the Gov ernment of Punjab also appears to be opposing the 
expansionist project s of DHA Lahore.  Para 9 of the Summary made for 
the Chief Minister Punjab on 4.2.2011 is reproduced as under:  
“9. After examining the legal and factual position, the 
committee was of th e view that the DHA has notified certain 
area as “controlled area” beyond the ‘specified area’.  The 
notification travels beyond the jurisdiction given by law to the 
DHA.  Hence, it is ultra vires the Order and is of no legal 
effect.  The committee, theref ore, proposed that the 
Government of the Punjab may, in the first place, make a 
reference, duly vetted by t he Lahore Department, asking DHA  
to review this notification and earlier notifications, if any, 
which travel beyond the jurisdiction granted to it by  the 
Defence Housing Authority Order 2002.  
10. The Chief Minister, Punjab may approve the proposal 
contained in para -9/ante please.

8. In view of the above we had also asked the learned Advocate General 
Punjab to state his position.  He requests for some time.  Therefore, we 
would like to issue notice to the learned Advocate General Punjab and the 
learned Attorney General for Pakistan under section XXVII -A CPC to assist 
us in determining the above issues.  Notice shall also issue to the Auditor -
General of Pakistan and the Federal and Provin cial Governments.  
 
9. Mr. Asim Hafeez learned counsel for DHA states that by virtue of 
section s 2 (j) and (p) of the Chief Executive’s Order 26 of 2002, the area 
which has been shown on the map coloured yellow, even according to him 
has not been acquire d or taken on lease by DHA and as such it  cannot be 
declared as a specified area.  The aforesaid provisions are reproduced  
below:  
 
(j)  “Controlled area” means an area notified as such by 
the Authority;  
(p) “specified area” means all land acquired by or 
lease d to the Authority in any manner before the 
commencement of this Order and includes any land 
that may be acquired by, or leased to the Authority 
after such commencement ;” 
 
Mr. Asim Hafeez has also acknowledged  that according to the Statute the 
‘controlled area’ referred to in section 2(j) would be only such area, 
consequently the notification dated 5th November 2009 to the extent of the 
areas which have not been acquired outright by DHA cannot be allowed to 
stand  even if the vires of the Chief Executive’s O rder 2002 is for the time 
being not considered . We were, therefore, surprised that infrastructure 
facilities such as roads have already been made and plotting has been 
undertaken for sale/balloting despite absence of the title. The application 
of the notif ication for such areas is, therefore admittedly illegal.   
 SMC 11/2015  8 
10. Let this case be fixed for hearing on Monday, i.e. 7th September 
2015 . We have been assured by learned counsel for DHA that before the 
next date, appropriate advertisements shall be issued to forewarn  the 
general public as to the above matter. We also direct that land which is 
included in larger tracts and in joint khatas in which title has not come to 
vest with DHA, shall not be sold or advertised for sale.
