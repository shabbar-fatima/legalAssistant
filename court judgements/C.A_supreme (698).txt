O R D E R 
There are a number of miscellaneous matters before the 
Court in the shape of various CMA s. We first take up CMA Nos. 
2770 -2772/2023 since they relate to the compliance required by 
the order dated 14.04.2023 (“Order”),  for the release of Rs. 21 
Billion to the Election Commission of Pakistan  (“Commission”)  for 
the holding of general elections t o the Punjab and Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa Assemblies.  
 
2. CMA 2771/2023 is a report filed by the State Bank of 
Pakistan stating that a sum of Rs. 21 Billion from Account No. I of 
the Federal Consolidated Fund  (“Fund”)  has been allocated for 
purposes of the aforemen tioned general elections. The Commission 
has however  filed a report  (CMA 2770/2023)  stating that the said 
funds have not yet been made available to it.  These CMAs are 
taken on record.  
 
3. The Finance Division , Government of Pakistan  has also filed 
a report (C MA 2772/2023) in terms of the Order. The report seeks 
to justify why the funds have not been made available. Briefly 
stated, it is reported that the matter of providin g the funds was 
placed before the Federal Cabinet which, at its meeting held on CMAs.  2769 -2773 o f 2023 
In CMA No.2600 of 2023 in  
Const.P.5 of 2023.  3
17.04.202 3, decided that a demand for the authorization and 
release there of be sent to the National Assembly for its 
consideration  in terms of Article 82(2) read with Article 8 4 of the 
Constitution. The following motion was tabled before the National 
Assembly the s ame day  (“Demand No. 64A”) : 
 
“That a supplementary grant not exceeding Rs. 21 
billion be granted to the Federal Government to meet 
the expenditure (other than charged)  during the 
financial year ending 30th June, 2023 in respect of 
Election Commission of Pa kistan (Demand No. 64A)”  
 
 The Finance Division has reported that this motion was 
rejected by the National Assembly and the necessary funds could 
not therefore  be made  available to the Commission.  
 
4. The first point to note is that , as set out in the Order, it was 
specifically queried from the team from the Finance Division and 
confirmed by them, that Article 84 allows and enables the Federal 
Government to make expenditur es from the Fund for, inter alia, 
“expenditure upon some  new service not included in the Annual 
Budget Statement” during any financial year . For such expenditure 
the Federal Government  obtains ex post facto authorization from 
the National Assembly  in the f orm of a Supplementary Budget 
Statement. The team from Finance Division also stated  that the 
normal practice was for the Supplementary Budget Statement for 
the current financial year (as also any previous years) to be laid 
before the National Assembly alon g with the Annual Budget 
Statement for the succeeding financial year, with both then to b e 
approved. There can therefore be no doubt, as noted in the Order, 
that the Federal Cabinet all along itself had the authority and 
power to authorize the expenditure of Rs. 21 Billion from the Fund CMAs.  2769 -2773 o f 2023 
In CMA No.2600 of 2023 in  
Const.P.5 of 2023.  4
in order to enable the Federation to perform its constitu tional 
obligations  in relation to the general elections . 
  
5. The learned Attorney General, in our view quite correctly 
and properly, did not attempt to seriously dispute  the position as 
just stated. However, the reason why in the present case the 
matter was first referred to the National Assembly was sought to be 
explained. The learned Attorney General submitted that at an 
earlier date, the National Assembly had passed a resolution 
expressing its disapproval of the release of any funds for the 
holding of the general elections. It was this resolution that created 
a certain doubt and uncertainty , and so the Federal Cabinet 
decided to first refer to the National Assembly. On a query from the 
Court the learned Attorney General stated that the earlier 
resolution wa s not in terms of a specific request for a grant of 
funds for a financial measure. With respect, we were not satisfied 
that the earlier resolution stood in the way of the Federal Cabinet 
exercising its constitutional power under Article 84. The reasons 
for this are set out below.  
 
6. To the extent therefore that the report of the Finance 
Division concludes, or proceeds on the basis that, the Federal 
Government did not itse lf have the requisite constitutional 
authority and power at all times to authorize the ex penditure of Rs. 
21 Billion for the general elections, it cannot be accepted . 
 
7. The effect of the Federal Cabinet ’s decision  to refer the 
matter to the National Assembl y in terms as noted above, and for 
Demand No. 64A  to be rejected when voted upon by  that House  
may now be considered . In terms of the system of parliamentary CMAs.  2769 -2773 o f 2023 
In CMA No.2600 of 2023 in  
Const.P.5 of 2023.  5
democracy envisaged by the Constitution the Government of the 
day must command the confidence of t he majority of the National 
Assembly  at all times . Furthermore, given that the office of Prime 
Minister has primacy  (who is declared by Article 91(1) to be the 
chief executive of the Federation) , this also means that the Prime 
Minister must enjoy  the confi dence of the majority of the National 
Assembly at all times.  It follows from the foregoin g (and this is an 
important constitutional convention) that the Government of the 
day must be able to secure the passage of all financial measures 
that it submits befo re the National Assembly. This would be 
certainly true for a financial measure of constit utional importance, 
i.e., one that seeks the release of funds for the holding of general 
elections to two Provincial Assemblies.  
 
8. When viewed from this perspective t he rejection of Demand 
No. 64A has serious constitutional implications. One possibility is  
that the Government (and also, since the Federal Cabinet is 
appointed on the advice of, and is headed by, him, the Prime 
Minister) have lost the confidence of the maj ority of the members of 
the National Assembly. The learned Attorney General categorically  
stated that this was not so. The Federal Cabinet and the Prime 
Minister have, and had, at all times the confidence of the majority 
of the National Assembly. For prese nt purposes, we accept this 
statement made by the learned Attorney General. The other 
possibility then is that the putative rejection of Demand No. 64A  is 
to be regarded as anomalous, and the resulting  situation can be 
rapidly rectified. The learned Attorn ey General fully appreciated 
the serious constitutional consequences that would flow , wer e the 
first possibility  to reflect the correct position . Furthermore, any CMAs.  2769 -2773 o f 2023 
In CMA No.2600 of 2023 in  
Const.P.5 of 2023.  6
future to and fro of this matter between the executive and 
legislative branches would not adv ance or serve any constitutional 
purpose. T here would be a serious breach of constitution al duty 
and obligation. It is also to be emphasized that the orders of this 
Court seek only to enforce and effectuate binding constitutional 
obligations. A disobedienc e and defiance of the orders of the Court 
can itself have serious consequences.  The learn ed Attorney General 
was therefore  directed to draw the attention of the Federal Cabinet 
and the Prime Minister to the foregoing so that the matter is 
remedied at the e arliest. The Court requires that appropriate 
remedial measures be taken in full measure n ot later than  
27.04.2023 and, in particular, by that date the sum of Rs. 21 
Billion be provided, in immediately available and realizable funds, 
to the Commission for t he holding of the general elections to the 
Punjab and KPK Assemblies.   CMA 2772/2023  is, for the time 
being, dealt with in the foregoing terms.  
 
9. CMA 2773/2023 is filed by the Federal Government. It 
seeks to place on record a report, prepared by the Minist ry of 
Defence, on the security situation in the country at the present 
time and for the n ext few months This CMA is moved under Order 
33, R. 6 SCR and the relief sought is for the order  dated 
04.04.2023 , whereby CP 5/2023 was finally disposed of , be 
recall ed. It was pointed out to the learned Attorney General that 
such an application could not  be entertained nor relief granted , as 
CP 5/2023 ha s been d ecided  by final judgment. CMA 2773/2023 
is therefore disposed of as not maintainable.  
 
10. The last matter is CM A 2769/2023 which purports to be a 
representation filed by the Commission.  It seeks, in e ssence, for CMAs.  2769 -2773 o f 2023 
In CMA No.2600 of 2023 in  
Const.P.5 of 2023.  7
the Court to restore the date fo r the general elections to be 
08.10.2023, which was impugned before the Court in CP 5/2023 
and set aside by the order dated  04.04.2023. The Commission 
seeks restoration of the said date on essentially security gr ounds, 
which in large measure overlap the concerns expressed in the 
report of the Ministry of Defence appended to CMA 2773/2023. In 
our view the Commission seeks, in t he guise of a representation, to 
re-agitate matters that were before the Court when CP 5/ 2023 was 
heard and decided, and in which two fully instructed learned 
counsel were permitted to make submissions on its behalf. It is 
impermissible to attempt to so re open issues and questions that 
already stand finally decided. The representation is not 
maintainable and CMA 2769/2023 is disposed of accordingly.
