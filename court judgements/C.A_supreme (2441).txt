ORDER  
 
         Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J .- The petitioner is 
in receipt of a guilty verdict  returned by the learned Addl. 
Sessions Judge -IV Quet ta in a complaint instituted by Azhar 
Ahmed Khan, no other than  his paternal nephew ; he alongside 
his brother Saif -ul-Islam Khan, since dead, was indicted for 
depriving female legatees from their share s in the legacy . 
Convicted under sections 466, 467, 474  and 498 -A read with 
section 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 , they were to periods 
of imprisonments ranging from 5 to 10 y ears with direction to pay 
fine; sentences to be commuted concurrently, pre -trial period 
inclusive,  vide judgment dated 20.6.2014 . The High Court of 
Balochistan  reduced quantum of sentence under section 498 -A to 
5-years  whereas on the remainder counts, to 1-year, vide 
judgment dated 30.6.2021, leave to appeal wherefrom has been 
prayed for on the grounds that there was no occasion for  the High 
Court to decline petitioner’s appeal inasmuch as the prosecution 
had failed to come up with “ proof beyond doubt ” before the 
learned trial Court ; it is next argued that the fate of indictment is Cr.P. 1596 /2021.  
decisively linked with the outcome of civil litigati on still raging 
between the parties. It is lastly argued that both the Court  
escaped notice of Criminal Law ( Third Amendment ) Act 2011  that 
inserted Chapter XX -A in the Pakistan Penal Code  incorporating 
section 498 -A w.e.f. the 28th of December, 2011 , and, thus, the 
petitioner , according to prosecution’s own case , has been 
convicted  in violation of  Constitutional protection against 
retrospective punishment. Contentions raised need consideration. 
Leave is granted . Notice shall issue to the State.
