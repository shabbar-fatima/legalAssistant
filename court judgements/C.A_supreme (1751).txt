  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHA UDHRY, CJ.  –  
CMA NO. 290 OF 2012  
  The Commission constituted to probe into the origin, 
authenticity and purpose of the alleged Memo dated 11.05.2011 has 
submitted a request through its Secretary for the enlargement of the 
time. We have heard the learned Attorney General for Pakistan , who CONST P 77 -2011 /2010 , etc.  3 
has briefed us about the proceedings so far undertaken by the 
Commission. From the facts so narrated by him, it seems that the 
Commission has not completed its proceedings to procure evidence, 
and as it has been pointed o ut that Mr. Mansoor Ijaz has not appeared 
before the Commission, therefore, some time is likely to be consumed 
to complete this exercise. The learned Attorney General for Pakistan  
and the learned counsel appearing for Mr. Hussain Haqqani have no 
objection.  However, Barrister Zafarullah  Khan , ASC  has stated that in 
absence of the statement of Mr. Mansoor Ijaz, the statement of DG, 
ISI who has already given his affidavit,  be recorded. We do not want 
to interfere in the proceedings, which are being undertaken by the 
Commission . However, in the interest of justice, we extend the time 
for completion of the proceedings for a period of two months 
commencing from the passing of this order.   
CMA NO. 331 OF 2012  
2.   The learned counsel for Mr. Hussain Haqqani has 
submitted an application, inter alia, stating therein that he has fully 
cooperated with the Commission and will continue to do so and also 
undertakes to return to Pakistan any time on four days’ notice  to join 
the proceedings , if and when required to do so by the Commission, 
therefore, the condition placed upon him of not leaving the country be 
withdrawn and he be allowed to join his family  abroad . The learned 
Attorney General for Pakistan  has no objection if permission as prayed 
for is accorded and Mr. Huss ain Haqqani is allowed to leave the 
country in view of the undertak ing given in the application to return 
back on four days ’ notice  whenever his attendance is required by the 
Commission. It is to be noted that in the earlier orders dated 
01.12.2011 & 30.12 .2011 , he was asked not to leave the country CONST P 77 -2011 /2010 , etc.  4 
without prior permission of this Court and now such permission is 
being sought and for the reasons disclosed hereinabove, he is allowed 
to leave the country. However, he will provide his full particulars to the 
Registrar of this Court and be also bound to return back on four days’ 
notice if his attendance is required by the Commission or by this Court.  
CMA NO. 329 OF 2012  
3.   Mr. Muhammad Akram Sheikh, Sr. ASC has submitted an 
application for recording of evid ence outside the country. He may 
place this request before the Commission for passing of appropriate 
order.  
4.   Mr. Mansoor Ijaz has addressed a letter to the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan under the caption “secret letter” wherein he has 
disclosed certain in formation, but we are not aware of its authenticity. 
It is a cardinal principle of law that whenever a person claims 
confidentiality or requests the Court to treat any document as 
confidential or classified, the Court may go through it, but its status to 
be treated as confidential or classified document has to be decided 
according to law. However, as he has engaged a counsel , we would 
have appreciated if he had sent such a document to the Court through 
his counsel . Be that as it may, at this stage, we would  not be 
considering this document for any purpose, but the same would be 
kept in a sealed cover under lock by the Registrar of this Court. 
Registrar present in Court is directed accordingly.  
CONST. PETITION NO. 92 OF 201 1  
5.   Mr. Shahid Orakzai, petitio ner has appeared in person and 
stated that he ha s raised a different question  in his petition , which are 
not taken up in the petitions already entertained. Issue notice to the CONST P 77 -2011 /2010 , etc.  5 
respondents to file comments before the next date of hearing. To be 
fixed along with other petitions.
