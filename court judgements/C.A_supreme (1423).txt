ORDER
A.MIN-UDDIN BRAN. J. Through this petition filed
under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 leave has been sought against the judgment dated
29.92021 passed by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench,
Multan whereby Writ Petition No. 7850 of 2019 filed by the
petitioner was dismissed.
2. Respondent No. 3 filed a composite family suit for
dower, dowry articles and maintenance 011 25.5.2015 whereas the
petitioner filed a civil suit on 01.01.2016 against respondent Nos. 3
to 6 for cancellation of entries of Column No. 14, 16 and 19 of
Nikab Nama between the petitioner and respondent No. 3 dated
19.1.2003 on the basis that same have been nn1-,.A 1i -

knowledge and consent and are, therefore, illegal and wrong etc.
The learned trial court vide consolidated judgment dated
25.10.2018 partially decreed the suit of respondent No. 3 whereas
the suit of the petitioner was dismissed. The record shows that the
petitioner opted to file a single appeal under section 14 of the
Family Courts Act, 1964 against the findings and decrees passed
by the learned Civil Judge/Judge Family Court whereby the suit of
respondent No. 3 was partially decreed whereas suit of the
petitioner was dismissed. Respondent No. 3 also filed an appeal
which was partially accepted whereas that of the petitioner was
dismissed. Again the petitioner opted to file a writ petition against
both the decrees i.e. decree of dismissal of his appeal as well as the
decree of partial acceptance of appeal of respondent No, 3.
3. At the very outset, when confronted with the learned
counsel that whether the suit of the petitioner was a civil suit or a
family suit and whether it was filed before the civil court or the
family court, states that he filed a civil suit before the civil court
though the family court was having the jurisdiction of the civil
court also who decided both the suits through a consolidated
judgment. We are afraid that even if the family court concerned
had civil jurisdiction as well, two suits could not be consolidated in
a single proceeding. It is a cardinal principle of law that causes
emanating from different jurisdictions cannot be consolidated in a
single proceeding. A civil matter cannot be consolidated with a
criminal matter, so also it cannot be consolidated with a family
matter. Reliance can be placed on "Muhammad Khalid V.
Muhammad Naeerrt and 6 Others" (PLD 2012 Lahore 490) and
"ManzoorAhmad v. Messrs Facto (Pakistan) Ltd. and Others" (1996
MLD 265).
C.P. No. 648212021 	 3
4. We further see that the nature of the claim asserted in
the civil suit of the petitioner fails within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the family court since 2015 when the Family Courts Act, 1954
was amended in Punjab and a new residuary entry - "any other
matter arising out of the Nikahnama" - was introduced at serial
no. 10 in Part I of the Schedule to the Act (by way of Family
Courts (Amendment) Act 2015 (XI of 2015). Thus a suit challenging
the validity of any entry of the Nikahnama was to be tried
exclusively by the family court. The said amendment was merely
procedural in nature bringing a change in the forum where the
grievance was to be agitated. Reference can be made to "Gut Hassan
and Co. v. Allied Bank of Pakistan (1996 SCMR 237), "Adrian Afta! v.
Capt. Sher Aftat" (PLD 1969 SC 187), "Ch. SafdarAll v. Maliklkram
Elahi and another" (1969 SCMR 166), "Muhammad Abdu!lah a
Imdad All" (1972 SCMR 173), "Bashir v. Wazir All" (1987 SCMR
978), "Mst. Ni ghat Yasmin v. N.E. of Pakistan" (PLD 1988 SC 391),
"Yusuf All Khan ii. Hongkong and Shan ghai Banking Corporation,
Karachi" (1994 SCMR 1007). Therefore, any suit pointing a finger
at any entry of the Nikahnama instituted before and pending trial
or filed subsequent to the above amendment shall be deemed to
have been filed as a family suit and to be tried or transferred or
deemed to have been transferred to a family court if already being
tried by such court. The suit filed by the petitioner would thus also
be deemed to have been filed as a family suit which was validly
consolidated with the suit of respondent no. 3 and decided as a
family suit by the family court. The petitioner rightly filed a family
appeal against the dismissal of his suit.
5. As notice of the filing of this CPLA was sent by the
AOR to all the respondents, therefore, brother of respondent No. 3
C.P. No. 648212021 	 -	 4
as well as respondent No. 5 and respondent No. 6 along with the
original record are present.
6. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner
and gone through the entries of Nikah Nama. By their perusal,
through the naked eye, there is no cutting or variation of writing
etc. in the original record. Even otherwise, the findings of fact
recorded by the learned trial court are correct on the basis of
records available with the court. So far as the findings of fact
recorded by the learned family court in partially decreeing the suit
of respondent No. 3 are concerned, she was not satisfied with the
said findings. On her appeal which was partially accepted on the
basis of findings of fact recorded by the appellate court which were
challenged through a writ petition before the High Court by the
petitioner, the petitioner was required to show some jurisdictional
defect committed by the fora below, but he could not show any
such defect, therefore, the writ petition was dismissed. In these
circumstances, the petitioner failed to make out a case for the
grant of leave. Consequently, leave to appeal is refused and the
petition stands dismissed.
