ORDER  
  CMA Nos.9040 to 9048 of 2023 . These 
applications have been moved on behalf of various individuals 
for impleadment in the listed petitions. They are not 
supported by appropriate affidavits as per requirement of the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980. The same are accordingly 
dismissed.  
 
2.  CM Appeal Nos.80, 108, 117, 124, 130, 131 & 
145 of 2023 . It appears that the office had raised objections 
regarding the maintainability of petitions filed by the 
Appellants. In terms of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 such 
appeals are to be assigned to Honoura ble Judges of this 
Court in Chambers for appropriate orders. Office has wrongly 
fixed these CM Appeals directly before the Court. The same Constitution Petition Nos.24, 25, 26, 27 & 28 and 30 & 35 of 2023  
 4
are accordingly returned to the office to do the needful in 
terms of the applicable Rules.  
 
3.  Constitution Petition s No.24 to 28, 30 & 35 of 
2023 . The learned Attorney General for Pakistan has been 
heard at considerable length. He has concluded his 
submissions. We have inquired from Mr. Shah Khawar, 
learned ASC, if he wishes to make any submissions. He 
submits that the  Respondent that he was representing had 
been impleaded in his personal capacity and is no longer the 
Federal Interior Minister. As such, he does not wish to make 
any submissions.  
 
4.  The same stance has been taken by Mr. Irfan 
Qadir, learned ASC, who ap peared for the then Defence 
Minister who had also been impleaded in his personal 
capacity.  
 
5.  Since the arguments have been heard, the hearing 
of these matters is concluded. The listed petitions are decided 
in terms of a short order to be announced toda y.
