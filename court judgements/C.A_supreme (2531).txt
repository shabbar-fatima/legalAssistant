ORDER  
 
 
  After the hearing conducted in H.R.C. No.29388 -K/13, a 
comprehensive order was passed on 10.12.2013. In this order , it was 
inter alia  declared t hat Army authorities have removed 35 person s from 
Malakand Inte rnment Centre out of whom only 7 persons have been 
produced. It had also been directed that the authorities , whether of the 
Army or otherwise , had no authority to detain these person s illegally . 
As a consequence , the Chief Executive s of the Federal Government and 
Government of the Province of KPK were directed to “ immediately 
proceed with this case and ensure recovery of these person s within 07 days 
and submit report to the Registrar for our per usal.”  Furthermore, persons 
responsible for such detention were ord ered to be ‘dealt  with strictly in 
accordance with law”.  It is apparent that this order has not been  2
complied with. Instead , an application (CMA No.8032/13)  has been 
filed seeking permissio n to file an additional document in C ourt. The 
additional document pu rports to be a notification dated 20.12.2013 . In 
view  of its relevance the said document i s reproduced in extenso :- 
“  GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN  
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE  
 
NOTIFICATION  
Subject: - COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE ORDER OF 
SUPREME COURT DATED 10TH DEC, 2013 IN 
HRC NO.29388 -K OF 2013 : APPLICATION BY 
MUHABAT SHAH S/O QABAL SHAH  
 
  The Hon’ble Prime Minister has been pleased to 
constituted a Committee for implementation of the Hon’ble Supreme  
Court order dated 10.12.2013. The Committee shall include: - 
 
 (i) Minister for Defence  - In Chair  
 (ii) Attorney General for Pakistan  - Member  
 (iii) Secretary Defence   Member  
 (iv) Secretary Interior   Member  
 (v) Secretary Law, Justice   Member  
and H uman Rights  
 
2.  The Committee is mandated to discuss the issue in 
depth and submit recommendations with time lines for compliance of 
order dated 10th December, 2013 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan. The committee may also propose draft law  as per directions 
of the Court vide para 18 of the said order.  
3.  The date and venue for the first meeting will be 
communicated shortly.  
 
Sd/- 
(Hasan Mahmud)  
Deputy Secretary (Army -A) 
Ph:9271127  ” 
 
We note that there is no report of compliance of our o rder and the 
directions contained therein. Furthermore, the persons responsible for 
illegal/unconstitutional acts were directed to be dealt  with in 
accordance with law. This also has not been done. Since there is prima 
facie non compliance of an order of t his Court , consequential 
proceedings are required to be initiated.   3
2. Notice shall therefore, issue initially to the Secretary to the Prime 
Minister who shall bring the above noted non -compliance to the notice 
of the Chief Executive/Prime Minister. Likewi se, notice shall issue to 
the Chief Secretary, KPK who shall bring the above noted non -
compl iance of Court order to the attention of the Chief Executive KPK. 
Notice shall also issue to the Secretary, Law,  Justice & Human Rights . 
The lear ned Additional Atto rney  General, upon being questioned  as to 
why the Court order has not been complied with, states that he needs 
some time to obtain instructions. He may obtain instructions today . 
The Chief Executive of the Federal and Provincial governments 
respectively may also file comments in light of the above.  
3. In addition to the above, we have  observed in  our order dated 
10.12.2013 that ther e is no law which allows for un declared internees. 
We had therefore, expressed the view that ” there must be some legislation 
to control such like activities and the Federation through Chief Executive  
must ensure that in future no e nforce d disappearance take s place.”  The 
notification  dated 20.12.2013  reproduced above, apart from being 
irrelevant in terms of the directions of this Court dated 10.12.2013 , has 
merely mandated  a Committee  “to discuss the issue in -depth and s ubmit 
recommendations with time line” for compliance of our order dated 
10.12.2013 . 
4. Mr. Tariq Mehmood Khokhar, Additional Attorney General, on 
his request, was granted some  time to obtain instruct ions in respect of 
any compliance  with the order dated 10.12.203 and the current status 
of legislation, if any, in terms mentioned in sub -para 2  of para  18 of  our 
order dated 10.12.2013. After about 40 minutes, the case wa s taken up  4
again when Mr. Shah Khawar, learned Additional Attorney General 
appeared and stated that according to his instructions a report was 
submitted in the office of the Registrar of this Court on 19.12.2013. The 
said report is not on our file. Neverth eless, a copy which purpo rts to be 
“an inter im reply ” to the Court order of 10.12.2013 has been submitted 
in Court. Since confidentiality is being claimed in respect of the 
“interim reply ” the same is ordered to be placed in a sealed envelope 
to be kept wi th the Registrar ; but we may briefly observe that  
compliance of  the order of 10.12.2013 has not been shown in the said 
“interim reply” .  
5. Furthermore, we have, since July last year, been consistently told 
that the government is serious in addressing the issue of missing 
persons an d in this behalf legislation is also being made. Regrettably , 
despite various statements made on behalf of the Federation, even 
today th ere is no legislation in respect of enforced disappearances  
other than the  Action (In Aid of Civil Power) Regulations, 2011.  These 
regulations however, do not address the questions which have arisen  
in relation to missing persons  and the enforcement of Fundamental 
Rights guaranteed, inter alia, by Articles 9 and 10 of the Constitution .  
6. We ha ve repeatedly, at least since July last year, been 
emphasizing to the government that in view of said Articles 9 & 10 of 
the Constitution , no person can be detained/incarcerated  without the 
backing of a valid law. It has also been emphasized by us from tim e to 
time that deviation from the Constitution and law by the government 
would also constitute violation of Article 5 of the Constitution , quite 
apart from  undermining the authority of the government . In our  5
judgment in the case of Sindh High Court Bar Ass ociation Vs. Federation 
of Pakistan   (PLD 2009 SC 879) , it was noted that it would “ be for the  
representatives of the people  … to determine if the absence of the rule of law within 
the upper echelons and formal structures of the State has, in a significant  way, 
generated the lawlessness which permeates our society today …“ 
7. Let this matter be listed for hearing on 20.01.2014. All the 
relevant quarters mentioned above may  file comments/replies by 
17.01.2014. On the next date of hearing , further orders shall  be passed 
to ensure compliance of our order dated 10.12.2013 . 
CMA No.8033/2013.  
8. The learned Additional Attorney G eneral has drawn our 
attention to para 8 of our order dated 10.12.2013 and has pointed out 
that at two points a statement has been referred  to as having been 
made by the Attorney General. He states that the statement was made 
by the Additional Attorney General and likewise t he direction 
mentioned  in  para   8  was  also  made  to  the  Additional Attorney 
General,   not to the   Attorney   Gener al. This submission prima facie is 
correct, s ince Mr. Tariq Mehmood Khokhar , the Additional Attorney 
General was prese nt on 10.12.2013  and has confirmed that the order when 
dictated mentioned Additional Attorney General. The application has been  
moved   by Mr.  Tariq   Mehmood   Khokhar, Additional   Attorney  General   
himself   and the same is supported by his own affidavit.  The omission  
of the word ‘Additional’  appears to be inadvertent. The same is 
therefore, di rected to be corrected. He also points out that  the reference    
  6
to  the  order   in  para   8  should  to be to the order passed on 
24.10.2013 and not on 24.8.2013. Having seen the file it does appear 
that the date of 24.8.2013 is on account of a typographic al/clerical 
error. The same is, there fore, ord ered to be corrected to  24.10.2013.  The 
present Application stands disposed of accordingly.
