ORDER  
Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - Through the present review petition, the 
petitioner seeks a review of the order dated 8 November 2023 passed 
by one of us (Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.)  whereby his appeal filed 
against an order of the  Registrar , dated 27 May 2022 , was dismissed  
and the said order  was maintained . By order dated 27 May 2022, the 
Registrar had returned  being not entertainable  a CMA of the petitioner  
filed for restoration of his CMA No.2384/2022.  
2. Briefly, the background  facts that have given rise to the present 
review petition are as follows: By its order dated 3 May  2019, the 
Federal Service Tribunal dismissed the petitioner's service appeal 
regarding his annual increments, pensionary benefits, etc., for the 
period he remained  dismissed from service. He filed a petition for leave 
to appeal (CPLA 3020/2019) against that order in this Court and also 
filed a review petition before the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed his 
review petition by its order dated 17 July  2019. Aga inst this order, the 
petitioner filed another petition for leave to appeal (CPLA 3774/2019).  
3. The present review petition pertains to the second CPLA, i.e., 
CPLA 3774/2019. This CPLA was dismissed by a two -member Bench 
on 5 October  2021, for non -prosecut ion and for being time -barred. C.R.P. No.1077 /2023. 
 
 
 2
Instead of filing a review petition , since the CPLA had been dismissed 
on the ground of being time -barred  also, the petitioner filed an 
application (CMA 12715/2021) for restoration of the said CPLA. 
Although this application was not entertainable in view of the law 
declared in Fazal Muhammad ,1 the office wrongly received and 
registered it. Anyhow, CMA 12715/2021 was also dismissed by a two -
member Bench for non -prosecution on 1 February  2022.  
4. The petitioner then filed an app lication (CMA 2384/2022) for the 
restoration of CMA 12715/2021. This second application was 
dismissed by a two -member Bench on 10 May  2022, for non -
prosecution and for being non -maintainable. Again, instead of filing a 
review petition , since CMA 2384/2022 had been dismissed on the 
ground of being non -maintainable  also, the petitioner filed an 
application (CMA) for the restoration of CMA 2384/2022. The Registrar 
returned this application for being not entertainable by order dated 27 
May 2022, and the petitio ner’s appeal against t his order of the 
Registrar was dismissed by  one of us (Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.)  vide 
order dated 8 November  2023. Hence, the petitioner has filed this 
review petition.  
5. We have heard the petitioner who appeared in person and 
examined the record  of the case . 
6. Both the Registrar's original order returning the petitioner’s 
CMA and the  appellate order maintaining that order were 
administrative in nature.2 Therefore, we asked the petitioner to specify 
under which provision of the Constitution3 or the Rules4 he has filed 
the present review petition. He, however, could not cite any such 
provision. It hardly needs clarification that Article 188 of the 
Constitution and Order  26 of the Rules pertain to the review of judicial  
orders, not administrative orders . The misunderstanding of the 
petitioner, who has filed the present review petition in person without 
obtaining any legal advice, is understandable. But, it is surprising t hat 
the office has entertained the present review petition despite there

being no provision for such a review petition in either the Constitution 
or the Rules.  
7. As held by this Court in Fazal Muhammad5 on the judicial side 
and reiterated in Ahsan Abid6 on the administrative side, a petition 
that does not fall within the scope of any provisi on of the Constitution, 
the law  or the Rules is "frivolous" and s hould not be 
received/ entertained by the Registrar, as per Rule 5 of Order 17 of the 
Rules. The offic e must be vigilant about this legal position and perform 
its administrative duty in this regard with due diligence.  
8. The present review petition is neither entertainable nor 
maintainable under any provision of the Constitution or the Rules. It 
is, theref ore, dismissed.
