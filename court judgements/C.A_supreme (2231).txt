surprised by a police contingent on 05.12.2020 within the precincts of 
Police Station Civil Lines, Rawalpindi  with 1320 grams of cannabis , 
concealed in a shopping bag ; he was  declined  bail throughout, lastly by 
a learned Judge -in-Chamber of Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench 
vide impugned order dated 23.02.2021 ; he seeks leave to appeal 
therefrom.  
2.  Heard. Record perused.  
3.  Red-handed with seizure of considerable quantity of  the 
contraband  squarely brings  petitioner’s  case within the  remit of  
‘Prohibition , contemplated by section 51 of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances Act, 1997 ; his claim  of false implication  is an issue that 
cannot be attended without going beyond the barriers of tentative 
assessment, an exercise prohibited b y law.  On our own analysis of the 
record,  view concurrently taken by the courts below  is not open to any 
legitimate exception . Petition fails. Leave declined.
