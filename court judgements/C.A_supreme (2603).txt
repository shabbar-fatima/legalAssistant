JUDGMENT
Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.- The petitioner, Sohail
Akhtar alias Pappu, was tried by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Lahore in case FIR No.205 of 2009 dated 07.03.2009, offence
under Sections 302/34, PPC, registered with Police Station
Baghbanpura, Lahore; he was convicted and sentenced vide
judgment dated 05.04.2012 as under:-
“Under Section 302(b), PPC sentenced to death as Ta’zir with
direction to pay Rs.500,000/- as compensation to the legal
heirs of the deceased in terms of Section 544-A, Cr. P.C. and
2
Jail Petition No.345/2017 and Cr. Petition No. 465/2017
in case of default in payment thereof to undergo S.I. for six
months.
Under Section 324, PPC, sentenced to undergo R.I. for seuen
gears.
Under Section 337-D, PPC, sentenced to undergo R.I. for flue
years with direction to pay 1/3 of diyat amount prevailing at
the time of occurrence. ”
2. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner
filed a criminal appeal before the High Court, whereas the trial Court
transmitted murder reference. Both these matters were taken up
together by a division bench of the High Court and through the
impugned judgment dated 11.04.2017, the appeal filed by the
petitioner was dismissed with modification in his sentence from
death to imprisonment for life, keeping the compensation intact; the
convictions/sentences recorded under Sections 324/337-D, PPC
were, however, maintained. All the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently with benefit of Section 382-B, Cr. P.C. Murder Reference
was answered in the negative.
3. Being aggrieved of the above decision, the petitioner has
filed Jail Petition No.345 of 2017 against his conviction, whereas
Rahul Naazir, the complainant, has moved Cr. Petition No.465 of
2017 for enhancement of sentence.
4. Precisely, facts of the case, as narrated in the FIR, are
that on 07.03.2009 at about IO.30 a.m. Adil Javed, brother of the
complainant while holding his son in lap was going to take a vehicle.
When he reached in front of shop of Butt Khradiy a, accused Sohail
Akhtar, ex-driver of brother of the complainant, started making fires
upon Adil Javed and his son, Dawood Javed. The complainant along
3
Jail Petition No.345/2017 and Cr. Petition No. 465/2017
with his brother Asif Naazir were also following Adil Javed. On
hearing the fire shots, they rushed towards the place of occurrence
and saw Pappu while firing with his pistol was running away. The
complainant and his brother Asif Naazir witnessed the occurrence.
They attracted towards their brother and bhateja and saw that they
were smeared with blood. They evacuated them in a cabin vehicle. At
that time, brother of the complainant was in his senses who told that
Pappu had made firing upon him and his son.
5. Having received information qua occurrence, Muhammad
Yousaf, ASI (PW-8) reached emergency ward of Services Hospital
where the complainant handed over a written application which was
transmitted to the police station for registration of a formal FIR. The
investigating officer moved an application before the Medical Officer
seeking permission for recording of the statement of Adil Javed, the
injured, which was refused. On 07.03.2009, investigation of the case
was entrusted to Muhammad Abbas, SI (PW- 12), who visited the
place of occurrence and secured blood; took into possession three
crime empties as well as blood stained cloths. On 09.03.2009, Adil
Javed succumbed to the injuries and the investigating officer added
Section 302, PPC.
The petitioner was arrested on 1 8.03.2009 . During
investigation, on 22.03.2009 the petitioner led to the recovery of .30
bore pistol with seven live bullets which were taken into possession.
Having found the petitioner guilty, the investigating officer prepared
report under Section 173, Cr. P.C. while placing his name in column
No.3 which was sent to the Court of Sessions en-routed through the
Illaqa Magistrate under Section 190(2), Cr.P.C.

6. On 05.09.2009, the trial Court formally charge sheeted
the petitioner to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
petitioner was examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C. wherein he opted
neither to appear as his own witness in terms of Section 340(2),
Cr.P.C. in disproof of allegations levelled against him nor to adduce
evidence in his defence. The prosecution in order to substantiate its
version produced as many as 13 prosecution witnesses.
7. After evaluating the evidence available on the record and
having found the version of the prosecution proved beyond any
shadow of doubt against the petitioner, trial Court convicted and
sentenced the petitioner as mentioned above.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that one
Pitras Sodagar whose name has been shown in the medical certificate
to accompany the injured but he was not produced as a prosecution
witness during trial; that presence of prosecution witnesses at the
place of occurrence at the relevant time is highly doubtful; with
regard to the mode and manner of occurrence, there are glaring
contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses;
regarding recovery of pistol and crime empties from the petitioner and
positive report of Forensic Science Laboratory, it has been argued
that the same were sent to quarter concerned after arrest of the
petitioner, thus of no legal value; that the prosecution witnesses
being the step brothers of the deceased are interested witnesses and
thus their statements cannot be believed and that the impugned
judgment has not taking into consideration the true facts and
circumstances of the case
5
Jail Petition No.345/2017 and Cr. Petition No. 465/2017
9. On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General
for the State, assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant,
while opposing the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the
petitioner states that the incident was promptly reported; that the
petitioner was named in the FIR with specific role of firing upon the
deceased and his son; it was a day light occurrence and there is no
chance of mis-identity; the prosecution witnesses fully established
the case against the petitioner; after arrest of the petitioner recovery
of weapon of offence was made on the pointation of the petitioner and
the same was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory which matched
with the crime empties collected from the place of occurrence. Thus,
he strongly supports the impugned judgment.
10. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner,
complainant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General for the
State and with their able assistance have scanned the material
available on the record_
11. It is well established from the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses that the petitioner had committed the murder of Adil
Javed, brother of the complainant and caused injuries to his son.
The ocular account of the occurrence is in line with the medical
evidence brought on the record. The prosecution witnesses have not
been shattered during cross examination and their evidence is
confidence inspiring. The judgment passed by the High Court is well
reasoned and based on proper appreciation of evidence available on
the record. The High Court through the impugned judgment has
rightly termed the recovery as inconsequential keeping in view the
fact that crime empties secured from the place of occurrence were
6
Jail Petition No.345/2017 and Cr. Petition No. 465/2017
dispatched to the Forensic Science Laboratory after arrest of the
petitioner and altered the penalty of death into imprisonment for life,
a sentence justified in the circumstances of the case. Learned
counsel for the petitioner has not been able to point out any infirmity
or illegality in the impugned judgment calling for the interference by
this Court.
12. In the circumstances, we hold that the prosecution has
successfully brought home guilt against the petitioner beyond any
shadow of doubt. Therefore, Jail Petition No.345 of 2017 lacking
merit is dismissed and leave refused.
13. As a natural corollary, Cr. Petition No.465 of 2017 filed
by the complainant for enhancement of sentence is also dismissed
and leave refused.
