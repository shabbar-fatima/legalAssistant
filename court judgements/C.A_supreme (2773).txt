Suo Moto Case 16/2011 : 
  In our order dated 14th December, 2012, 
following directions were made:  
 
“9. The Advocate General of the 
Province of Sindh is also directed to 
submit comprehensive compliance report 
in respect of the directions contained in 
Watan Party’s case and the orders passed 
thereafter by a Bench seeking 
implementation of the judgment. And if 
the judgment is not implemented in letter SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  3 
& spirit, he should pinpoint the person(s) 
individually and collectively responsible for 
the same. In the meanwhile the Pro vincial 
Government through its Chief Secretary 
should also furnish a statement as to why 
the killing in Karachi has again increased 
and what measures have been taken to 
ensure the safety and protection of the life 
and property of the citizens in Karachi. 
Detail of citizens, who were killed from 
13.09.2011 to date, be also furnished.”  
 
2.   A comprehensive report has not been 
submitted by the Advocate General, Sindh, except 
filing Criminal Misc. Application No.5/2013 in Criminal 
Original Petition No.96/2012.  Learned Advocate 
General and the Chief Secretary  as well as IGP , Sindh 
are hereby directed to put up a comprehensive report 
with reference to Order dated 6th October, 2011 , 
passed by this Court and all subsequent Orders 
passed by the learned High Court in  implementation 
proceedings as well as by the Bench of this Court , 
particularly , passed on 28th November, 2012. In the 
meanwhile, he is also required to submit as to 
whether in pursuance of the directions issued in Anita 
Turab  case, action against those po lice 
officers/officials and other officer s has been taken, 
who were promoted out of turn, if not so, what are 
the reasons?  SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  4 
CMA No.5385/2012 : 
3.   Mr. Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi, has filed this 
CMA, wherein he has attributed serious allegations 
against the administration and according to him as 
the police and administration is not taking interest, 
therefore, the situation of law and order is not 
improving in Karachi city. In one of the paras of the  
application , he has named one Wasim Beater, who 
being a police official, is committing crimes. When we 
inquired from IGP and other police officers, present in 
Court, they stated that they had no knowledge about 
him. However, Mr. Waseem Ahmed, Additional C hief 
Secretary , pointed out that there is a person by the 
name of Waseem Beater but he had no knowledge to 
the extent of his involvement in the commission of 
crimes. On this, we inquired from Mr. Sana Ullah 
Abbasi and Mr. Bashir Memon, DIGs , as to whether,  is 
there any such person, both of them categorically 
admitted that person of this name is involved in 
running gambling den etc. Mr. Sana Ullah Abbasi , 
even said that action must be taken against the said 
person and he may be brought to book under the law.  SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  5 
4.    It is painfully noted that neither IGP nor any 
other senior officer who are responsible for 
maintaining the law and order situation in Karachi, 
had no knowledge about the Mafia. If same is the 
position, then how it would be possible to control the 
situation of law and order in Karachi. Mr. Fayyaz 
Leghari, IGP , however, stated that he was contacted 
by Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi, who asked him for 
posting a person , namely , Ali Raza , as SHO Airport. 
This fact has been denied by the applicant. If such 
assertion is made to the police officers by Syed 
Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi, they should not entertain the 
same and it be brought to the notice of the Court.  
5.    The applicant stated that he has taken the 
names of the persons , including the police 
officials/offi cers and political figures , who are involved 
in disturbing the situation of law and order, therefore, 
he is apprehending danger to his life and property. In 
such view of the matter IGP, Sindh , is directed to 
provide him security and ensure that no harm is 
caused to him and his property.  SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  6 
6.   Notice of this CMA be issued to AG, Sindh, 
who after obtaining instructions from the Chief 
Secretary, IGP and others shall file reply on the next 
date of hearing.  
Criminal Original Petition No.96 of 2012 : 
7.   Let cop y of Cr.M.A . No. 5/2013 be handed 
over by the AG, Sindh to Mr. Abdul Latif Afridi, 
learned counsel appearing for Senator Haji Adeel for 
filing his reply. Criminal Original Petition No.96/2012 
shall also be heard along with the main case. Both 
these cases ar e adjourned to 22nd January, 2013 .   
 
Criminal Original Petition No.106/2012  And 
Crl.M.A. 765/2012 : 
 
8.  In compliance of order dated 14th December, 
2012, notice of contempt was issued to Altaf Hussain, 
Leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as on 
2nd December, 2012, while addressing a large 
gathering, uncalled for aspersions cast and 
expressions were used against the Hon’ble Judges of 
this Court. Today , Dr. Farogh Nasim, learned ASC 
appeared and filed in Court a duly executed Power of 
Attorney along w ith unconditional apology of Altaf SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  7 
Hussain. Contents whereof are reproduced herein 
below: - 
 “UNCONDITIONAL APOLOGY BY MR. ALTAF 
HUSSAIN  
 
“It is respectfully submitted as follows: - 
 
1. A learned Full Bench of the Hon’ ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has issued a 
notice for contempt of Court today (i.e. 
14.12.2012) against me for my speech 
dated 02.12.2012, which has come to my 
knowledge through the media reports.  
 
2. I have every intention to uphold the 
honour and dignity of the Courts of law. 
When I submit the instant unconditional 
apology I am most sincere in doing so and 
have a bonafide intention to tender an 
unconditional apology. All my life I have 
struggled for t he rule of law and with the 
bottom of my heart I desire the majesty of 
the Courts to be second to none. Therefore, 
I am tendering this unconditional apology 
at the earliest opportunity available to me 
and hereby withdrawl all adverse remarks 
made by me in respect of the learned 
Judges in my speech dated 2.12.2012. In 
future also I shall do everything to uphold 
the dignity of Judges.  
 
3. I hold the Hon’ble Supreme Court and 
each and every learned Judge of every 
Court including the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
in the highest esteem and verily believe in 
upholding the independence of judiciary 
and constitutionalism.  
 
4. I, therefore, throw myself at the 
mercy of the Honb’ble Supreme Court and 
submit an unconditional apology for the 
speech in issue (dated 02.12.2012)  and 
pray that the notice for contempt of Court 
may kindly be discharged in the interest of 
justice.

Dated: 14.12.2012  Altaf Hussain s/o late Naz eer Hussain,  
Founder Leader  
      Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)  
First floor, Elizabeth House  
54-58 High Street, Edgware  
Middx HA8 7EJ  
United Kingdom ” 
 
Mr. Altaf Hussain has not contested the proceedings 
of the Contempt of Court and has submitted 
unconditional apology for the speech in issue dated 
2nd December, 2012 and  prayed that notice of 
Contempt of Court may kindly be discharged in the 
interest of justice. Besides, he has also shown honour 
and respect to the Supreme Court and made 
commitment that in future he shall do everything to 
uphold the dignity of Judges.  
9.  This Court has repeatedly and consistently 
held that the ultimate purpose of proceedings for 
contempt is not the protection of a Judge personally 
but in fact it is for the protection of the public at 
large, whose rights and interests would obviously be 
affected, if by any act or omission of any party, the 
authority of the Court is lowered and the confidence 
of the people in the Administration of Justice is 
diminished or weakened.  SMC 16/2011 &  
Crl.O.P.106/12 etc.  9 
 
10.  Thus, under the circumstances, keeping in 
view the unconditional apology , we accept the request 
so made by Mr. Altaf Hussain. Consequently, 
contempt notice issued to him is hereby discharged. 
Contempt matter stands disposed of.  
11.   It is to be noted tha t during pendency of the 
contempt proceedings against Mr. Altaf Hussain, one 
Mr. Rauf Siddiqui, MPA , has addressed a letter to the 
Chief Justice wherein he had used contemptuous 
language expressing his grievance that as to why 
notice had been issued to Mr.  Altaf Hussain. Similarly, 
Dr. Farooq Sattar, MNA/Minister , while addressing a 
press conference on 16.12.2012 had used expressions 
against the Institution of Supreme Court, which were 
uncalled for. We have drawn attention of both of 
them, present in Court,  towards their statements, 
they readily agreed to file unconditional apology. 
Contents of the same are as under: - 
      “Unconditional Apology  
We render unconditional apolog y for any of 
our written or oral statements and throw 
ourselves to the mercy of this Hon’ble 
Court.

Islamabad          Sd/- 
Dt: 7.1.2013        Rauf Siddiqui”  
 
Since unconditional apology has been filed, therefore, 
no further a ction is called for.
