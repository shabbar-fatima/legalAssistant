JUDGMENT  
 
 
  FAISAL ARAB, J .- The respondent compan ies of both 
the connected appeals are cement manufacturing enterprise s. The 
respondent company of Civil Appeal No.427 of 2009 imported sixteen 
units of Volvo FM 400 Trucks . Seven of such trucks were imported  
vide IGM No.1151/2006, Index No.20 and Goods Declaration 
No.196467 dated 24.06.2006 a nd the remaining n ine trucks were 
imported v ide IGM No.1151/2006, Index No.21 and Goods 
Declaration No.196469 dated 24.06.2006. Similarly, the respondent 
company of Civil Appeal No.428 of 2009 imported two Volvo FM 400 
Trucks vide IGM No.1151/2006 , Index N o.19 and G oods Declaration 
No.196468 dated 24.06.2006 . All eighteen trucks were shipped to CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009

Karachi port on S.S. ‘Iron Butterfly’. Upon arrival of the ship b oth the 
respondent companies claimed exemption from duty in excess of 5% 
in terms of Serial No.21 of  SRO 575(I)/2006 dated 5.6.2006 and 0% 
sales tax in terms of SRO 530(I)/2005 dated 6.6.2005 by declaring 
that the imported trucks fall within the ambit of plant  as provided in 
SRO 575(I)/2006 dated 5.6.200 6. The entire basis for treating the 
trucks to be p art of the plant of their respective cement factories was 
that the imported trucks were Off -Highway trucks imported for their 
utilization in the industrial process of their respective cement 
factories, hence they be regarded as part and parcel of the ir cement 
manufacturing activity. Upon physical examination of the imported 
trucks , the Custom Examination Staff found the imported vehicles to 
be Volvo FM 400 trucks which were not Off -Highway dump trucks 
but simply On-Highway trucks . After disagreeing with the ir claim all 
eighteen trucks were classified under PCT Heading 8704.2290 which 
attracted 30% Ad Volerum customs duty and 15% Sales Tax .  
 
2.  Having been denied the claim of exemption under the 
above referred two SROs, the respondent compan ies challenged t he 
decisions of the Appraisement Collectorate before the Collector 
Appeals, who concurred with the decision s of the Appraisement 
Collectorate and dismissed the ir respective appeal s vide order s dated 
14.11.2006. The respondent compan ies then challenged the appellate 
orders before the Customs and Sales Tax Appell ate Tribunal  in 
Customs Appeals No. K -01 and K -32/2007 which  allowed their 
appeals through a common judgment dated 12.04.2007 after 
following the decision of Sindh High Court in the case of D.G. Khan 
Cement Limited Vs. Deputy Collector of Customs  (2003 PTD 986 ) and CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009  
 3
directed that excess duties and charges recovered from the 
respondent companies be refunded. T he Collectorate of Customs 
Appraisement was not satisfied with the tribunal’s decisions and 
challenged the same in the High Court of Sindh in two separate 
appeals bearing Special Customs Appeal s No. 348 and 349  of 2007. 
The High Court dismissed both the appeal s vide impugned judgment s 
dated 27.01.2009 , also relying on the decision that was rendered in 
the case of D.G. Khan Cement Limited supra . Dissatisfied with the 
common judgments rendered in both the appeals, the appellant s filed 
petition for leave to appeal in CPLA s No. 289 -K/2009  and 290-
K/2009 in this Court . Both the petitions after grant of lea ve were 
converted into present appeal s.   
 
   
3.  In the cement industry , Off-Highway tr ucks are used at 
the quarries where the predominant raw -material in the cement 
production ‘limestone’ is won by either extraction or blasting and 
then hauled on Off -Highway dump trucks to the place where the 
second stage in the cement manufacturing activity i.e. crushing of 
the raw -material takes place. In a decision of this Court rendered on 
25.05.2016 in Civil Appeal No. 1291 of 2005 in the case of Collector of 
Customs  Vs. D.G. Khan Cement Company Limited  heard by us 
alongwith the present appeals, a question arose as to whether the 
use of Off -Highway dump trucks in the cement industry makes it 
part of the plant that is engaged in the industrial process of 
producing ceme nt inspite of the fact that the Off-Highway dump 
trucks in their utilization remain mobile as against other machinery 
and equipment of the plant which directly or indirectly remains 
fastened to the earth. It was on account of the specific design and CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009

utility of Off -Highway Dump Trucks  in the industrial process of 
cement  production that we broadened the meaning of the term ‘plant ’ 
mentioned in SRO 484(I)/92 dated 14.05.1992  bringing the Off -
Highway dump trucks within its ambit  and thus answered the 
question i n the affirmative . In deciding so, we d id not approve the 
judgment of the High Court of Sindh rendered in the case of D.G. 
Khan Cement Limited Vs. Deputy Collector of Customs   (2003 PTD 
986) as it was based on an entirely different reasoning. The judgment 
of this Court in the case of Collector of Customs V s. D.G. Khan Cement 
Company Limited  rendered by us on 25.05.2016 in Civil Appeal No. 
1291/2005 was based on following reasoning :-  
 
8.  The layout plan of a cement factory determines what 
equipment, engine ering and construction is required to complete the 
industrial process that is to be undertaken. Ordinarily, a cement 
factory is located where the main raw -material to produce cement such 
as limestone is found in abundance. So the industrial process of a 
cement factory starts from quarrying of the limestone. Where the 
layout of the cement factory is so designed that it starts its industrial 
process from extracting its raw materials from quarry then the same 
has to be hauled to the facility where the raw -mate rials are to be first 
crushed. The entire set of machines used in conjunction with other 
apparatus and electrical and mechanical equipments, required for 
undertaking and completing the industrial process, starting right from 
quarrying till the finished pro duct that is produced is to be regarded as 
part of the plant of the respondent company. Off-Highway dump 
trucks, also called Off -Road dump trucks, are specifically designed for 
use in difficult terrain where the activity of mining, quarrying and 
constructi on of big buildings is carried out. These Off -Highway dump 
trucks, on account of their specific utility, have low payload capacity 
as well as low speed in comparison with the ordinary dump trucks 
that we see every day on roads and highways. Other than such  use, 
the Off -Highway dump truck cannot be economically used as an 
ordinary means of transportation of goods.  
 CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009

9.  In cement industry Off -Highway tr ucks are used at the 
quarries where the predominant raw -material in the cement production 
‘limestone’ is wo n from the quarry by either extraction or blasting 
following which it is hauled on Off -Highway dump trucks to the place 
where the second stage in the cement manufacturing i.e. crushing of 
the raw -material takes place. Thus there is direct nexus between the 
use of Off -Highway dump truck at the quarry of a cement 
manufacturing factory with its industrial process. This nexus brings 
the Off -High way dump truck within the definition of ‘plant’. When the 
industrial process of a cement factory starts with the quar rying activity 
of a cement factory, we see no reason why Off -Highway dump trucks’ 
utilization cannot be treated as part of the industrial process of a 
cement factory. Thus Off -Highway dump trucks cannot be excluded 
from being treated as part of the plant o f a cement factory, where their 
utility forms an integral function in the manufacturing of the cement. 
So irrespective of the fact that Off -Highway dump trucks required to be 
operated at the very first stage in the cement manufacturing activity 
i.e. quarry ing of the raw materials, are mobile vehicles, nevertheless 
these trucks are utilized to further the industrial process without which 
the industrial process of a cement factory would get interrupted and 
hindered at the very initial stage.  
 
10.  It may not  be out of place to mention here that extracting 
limestone and clay from the quarry can itself be a complete industrial 
process undertaken only to sell limestone in the market as its finished 
product. The customer of such enterprise could be a cement facto ry 
which is either not designed to start its industrial process from 
extracting limestone or for some reason the quarrying facility of a 
cement factory may have become dysfunctional and has to purchase 
limestone from elsewhere and transport it to its crush ing facility. In 
such a situation the activity of transportation of raw -materials from the 
place of procurement to the place of crushing facility of a cement 
factory, would not make such activity part of cement factory’s 
industrial process as mere transpor tation of a product from one facility 
to another, where it is utilized as raw material, does not make the act 
of transportation part of the industrial process of either of the two 
enterprises. However this does not seem to be the case with the 
respondent c ompany as in the present case the quarrying of materials 
is undertaken by one and the same enterprise which after completion 
of the remaining stages involved in the manufacturing of cement 
(crushing, blending, heating, cooling, clinkering and milling) ends  with CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009

the portable cement being produced in bulk or bags for consumption. 
The respondent company in the present case seems to be so designed 
that its’ Off -Highway dump trucks involved in the industrial process 
are to be regarded as part of the ‘plant’ of t he cement factory. We are 
therefore left with no other option other than to hold that the very use 
of Off -Highway dump trucks at the quarries make them part and 
parcel of the industrial process of a cement factory and thus such 
trucks fall within the defin ition of the respondent company’s cement 
plant.  
 
4.  In the present case , however, all eighteen trucks 
imported by the respondent compan ies are Volvo FM 400 trucks . 
Volvo is a  world renowned truck manufacturing company. It 
manufactures many kinds of truck s, which include both Off -Highway 
and On -Highway trucks. Volvo FM 400 trucks that were imported by 
the respondent companies being On -Highway trucks are d esigned for 
long distance highway transportation. These trucks can mount 
container on its chassis for l oading goods . As On -Highway truck is 
meant for long hauls, it also has a bunk in its cabin for its use as 
driver’s sleeping area. In contra st to such utility, the Off -Highway 
dump truck , as decided by us in the case of Collector of Customs V s. 
D.G. Khan Ce ment Company Limited  is specifically designed for use in 
difficult terrain s where the activit ies of  mining, quarrying or 
construction of big building s are carried out . Purely on account of the 
specific design and utility of Off -Highway dump trucks  in the 
industrial process of cement production that the same were brought 
within the ambit of plant . On the other hand, Volvo FM 400 trucks 
that were imported by the respondent companies , being On -Highway 
trucks and not Off -Highway dump trucks, were rightly treate d by the 
Appraisement Collectorate of the Customs as not being a part of the 
plant of a cement factory.  CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 427/2009  & 428/2009

5.  In view of the above discussion, we  hold that  the 
respondent companies were not entitled to claim exemption under  
SRO 575(I)/2006 dated 5.6.2006 a nd SRO 530(I)/2005 dated 
6.6.2005  on Volvo FM 400 trucks  that were imported by them as the  
same were found to be On-Highway trucks  and not Off -Highway 
dump trucks . The customs authorit ies shall recover the customs 
duties and Sales Tax on all eighteen Volvo  FM 400 trucks imported 
by both the respondent companies in terms of PCT Heading 
8704.2290 . These appeals are allowed in the above terms.
