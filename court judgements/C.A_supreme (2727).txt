ORDER  
 The learned Add l. Attorney General has referred to 
the report filed by the Special Joint Investigation Team ( “SJIT” ) 
on 04.01.2023 which recounts the progress made s o far in its 
investigative work since constitution of the SJIT on 07.12.2022. 
He has informed us that the Federal Government has provided 
requisite funds for investigative work to be done by the SJIT in 
two foreign countries, namely, UAE and Kenya. Request s for 
Mutual Legal Assistance ( “MLA” ) to the government in these 
countries were issued by the Federal Government on 04.01.2023. 
In this behalf he acknowledges that the Foreign Office is 
cooperating fully to secure the requisite help and collaboration of SMC 3 OF 2022  
 2
the concerned police/investigative authorities in both foreign 
States  for the SJIT . As soon as the MLA requests are responded 
favourably by the  two foreign governments, t he SJIT shall be 
visiting the said States for commencing their investigation 
abroad.  
 
2.  We note that the SJIT has performed some 
investigative work within Pakistan. 41 witnesses are reported to 
have been examined by it so far. The real issue s of the cause and 
perpetrators of the assassination of Mr. Arshad Sharif would be 
unravelled  after t he relevant evidence available abroad in the 
afore -noted two countries is collected. We expect that the SJIT is 
fully prepared with its priorities, scenarios and areas of inquiry in 
the investigation and the persons and material that would be 
relevant and useful solving the crimes committed. The learned 
Addl. Attorney General submits  that a month’s time may be given 
for the next report of the SJIT. Relist in the first week of 
February, 2023.
