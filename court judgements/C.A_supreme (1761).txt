                IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.  – M/S Senator 
M. Ishaq Dar, Khwaja Muhammad Asif, MNA, Malik Muhammad Rafiq 
Rajwana, Atiq Shah, Dr. Salahuddin Mengal, Sardar Asmatu llah Khan, 
Syed Ghous Ali Shah and Dr. M. Shamim Rana ASCs have concluded 
arguments on the maintainability of the petitions.  
2.             The learned Attorney General has stated that in pursuance 
of order dated 19.12.2011, the Federation of Pakistan thr ough 
Secretaries, Law, Foreign Affairs, Interior and Cabinet Divisions is in 
the process of preparing affidavits, which exercise is likely to be 
completed in the course of the day. He, therefore, suggested that in 
view of the queries being raised by the Co urt, it would be appropriate 
if he starts arguments on behalf of the Federation after filing of the 
affidavits.  
3.             The learned Attorney General has also placed on record 
under his own signature following statement on behalf of the Prime 
Minist er: -  
1.                The Prime Minister has highest regards for the Hon’ble judiciary and 
has been striving throughout his political life for independence of 
judiciary. The first step performed by him as Prime Minister was to 
order the release of detai ned Hon’ble Judges and thereafter to restore 
them.  
2.                The Prime Minister is of the view that in the Press Conference, the 
stance of the party was expressed in historical perspective and was 
not at all intended to ridicule the judiciary.   
3.                The Prime Minister has instructed me to assure the court that his 
government believes in supremacy of Constitution and rule of law and 
will always stand firmly for the same.      
4.             We have pointed out to the learned Attorney Gen eral that 
the reply purportedly filed by him on behalf of the Prime Minister is 
evasive because there should be categorical stand taken by the Prime 
Minister or the Federal Government in this behalf instead of shifting 
the burden upon the political party u nder the garb of historical 
perspective. Whereas contrary to it, the President of Pakistan, who 
himself is the Co -Chairperson of the Party in Government, i.e. the 
Pakistan Peoples Party, while submitting Reference No. 1 of 2011 
under Article 186 of the Con stitution under the caption “Revisit the 
case of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto” has recognized and accepted that the 
judiciary in Pakistan is independent and is playing a proactive role in 
the cases of public importance, which suggests that instead of making 
an ambi guous statement, the Federation/Federal Government ought to 
have taken a clear stand. The reply so filed is not acceptable. 
However, the learned Attorney General shall seek fresh instructions 
from the Prime Minister and file a comprehensive reply on the ne xt 
date of hearing. We are of the opinion that government premises could 
not be allowed to be used for holding a press conference wherein, 
prima  facie, the judiciary was ridiculed and insulted.  
5.             The learned Attorney General has stated that s ince he has a 
pre-scheduled meeting/commitment on 25.12.2011 at Karachi and he 
may not reach Islamabad on 26.12.2011, therefore, he has requested 
that the case be adjourned to 27.12.2011. Order accordingly.
