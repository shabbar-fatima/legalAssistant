 Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. —  Learned counsel contended that 
respondent EOBI  (Employees OLD -Age Benefi t Institution)  an 
institution/organization is resp onsible to receive in shape of contribution from huge 
number of insured persons and others under the EOB Act , 1976 and to disburse the 
amount to legitimate beneficiaries of the EOBI Pension Scheme under whi ch more 
than 3.7 million insured persons/workers are registered. He stated that currently more 
than 4,00,000.00 pensioners are being paid month ly pension in various categories , 
therefore, being custodian of the funds on behalf of the workers/labourers , the 
organization is required to conduct its business in a highly transparent manner 
instead of wasting the funds on whimsical and subjective consideration s. However, 
according to him presently massive corruption has been noticed by the petitioners  of 
whom one is the member of the Trade Union whereas the other  is employee over 
there. To substantiate his statement, he pointed out that in pursuance of the 
publication , which appear ed in d aily ‘Jang’ dated 16th April, 20 09, 132 vacancies 
were announced and applicat ions for the same  were called for upto 15th May, 2009 , 
in response whereof applications in thousands were received and later  call letters for Const. P.06/2011  2 
interview were issued to the candidates alongwith schedule . According to learned 
counsel the said posts were to be  filled in by means of open competition in a 
transparent manner but surprisingly instead of making recruitments/appointm ents on 
merit from  amongst the candidates who were issued call letters , consolidated list s 
were prepared on 16th May, 2010 by Dr. Jum mani, PS to the Minister for Labours 
and Manpower  and Imtiaz Ahmad who is D.G. F & A, according to which all these 
vacancies were filled on the recommendations of high ups/ influential  person s, names 
of which have been mentioned in the list s. For con venience sake, extracts from the 
lists are  reproduced hereinbelow:

2.  Learned counsel further pointed out that  the appointment s were made 
in such an unwarranted  manner that appointees were dir ected to submit their 
documents  after their appointments were made. He referred to a copy of such letter 
reproduced hereinbelow to show that perhaps at the time of their appointment no 
document i.e. educational testimonial e tc. was taken into consideration and 
appointments took place against the posts simply on the recommendations of the 
functionaries as is evident from the above lists . Const. P.06/2011  23 
 
3. Learned counsel stated that a good number of people were  also appointed on 
deputation /contract basis and subsequently without following  rules and regulations 
they were regularized.  
4. Similarly , learned counsel stated that the investment ha s been made by the 
EOBI in the institutions, which are not much profitable and the institutions  givin g 
better credit  have been intentionally avoided . According to  the learned counsel 
affairs of EOBI are not be ing run in a transparent manner  inasmuch as responsible 
functionaries have started indulging  in businesses, which are not considered  assured 
profit able like the real estate , stock exchange  etc. with the result that huge losses to 
public money have been caused .  
 
5. After having heard the learned counsel and having gone through the rele vant 
record so placed before us, we consider that his case require s to be examined in 
terms of Article 184(3) of the Constitution as it seems  that fundamental rights  of Const. P.06/2011  24 
huge number of workers and i nsured persons  as per  Articles  9, 14 and 25  of the 
Constitution  have been violated . Therefore, we direct that notices be issu ed to the 
respondent s as well as to the person s, whose appointments have been questioned 
being non -transparent to provide opportunity of hearing to all of them. However, 
notices are required to be issued to them through President Board of Governors, 
EOBI/ Secretary Labour and Manpower with directions to effect service upon all of 
them wherever they are posted and submit compliance report prior to the next date of 
hearing. Similarly the President of Board/Secretary Labour is directed to submit 
complete recor d of the above persons as well as the persons who have been 
appointed on deputation/ contract basis for the last three years and as to whether they 
have been regularized or not?  He is also directed to place on record as to whether 
the investment is being m ade in the profit bearing schemes or otherwise as alleged 
by the learned counsel.  
5. Let the matter be adjourned to a date in office after three weeks.
