 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that his 
nomination paper for the seat of  a Member of the National Assembly 
from NA-49, Attock -I was rejected by the Returning Officer on 
30.12.2023  on the ground that the petitioner was a proclaimed 
offender . However, upon filing of  an Election Appeal before the 
Appellate  Tribunal, the nomination paper  was accepted on 06.1.2024.  
Thereafter, the responde nt filed a writ petition before the Lahore High 
Court, which was decided vide  the impugned order dated 16.1.2023  
and the nomination paper of the petitioner was once again rejected on 
the ground that the petitioner was a  proclaimed o ffender. Learned 
counsel  for the petitioner submits that there is no provision under  the 
Constitution or the Election s Act, 2017 that deprives the petitioner 
from contesting elections  on this ground. Learned counsel for the 
Election Commission of Pakistan has not been able to sho w us any 
such provision of law.  We may also point out that Article s 62 (1) (d), 
(e), (f) and (g) has been recently declared by this Court  not to be self-
executory and merely to serve as guideline s for the voters in exercising 
their right to vote in Civil Appeal No. 982 of 2018 etc . titled Hamza
