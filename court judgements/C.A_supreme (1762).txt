avoid repetition , the prayer clauses of Constitution Petitions No. 72, 75 
and 77  of 2012  are reproduced hereunder : -  
CONSTITUTION PETITION NO. 72/2012 :

It is, therefore , respectfully prayed that the Contempt of 
Court Act 2012 may kindly be declared as ultra-vires of the 
Constitution.   
It is further prayed that pending the final disposal of this

It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that th is Hon’ble Court

whole in the int erest of justice. Any other relief, which may 
be deem ed fit and proper in the circumstances of the case , 
may also be awarded.      
 
2.  The background in which the COCA 2012 was enacted is 
that the National Reconciliation Ordinance, 2007  (Ordinance No. LX o f 
2007) , hereinafter referred to as the “NRO” , was promulgated by the  
President of Pakistan  on 05.10.2007 . It was challenged before this 
Court on 08.10.2007 and the Court vide judgment dated 16.12.2009, 
passed in Dr. Mobashir Hassan  (Supra ) declared the NR O as void ab 
initio and non est. In Paragraph  No. 178 of the judgment , it was held 
that all steps taken, actions suffered, and all orders passed by Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  6 
whatever authority, any orders passed by the Courts of law including 
the orders of discharge and acquittals recorded in favour of accused 
persons, are also declared never to have existed in the eyes of law and 
resultantly of no legal effect. However, despite express directions of 
the Court, the Federal Government failed to implement the judgment, 
therefore , vide order dated 29.03.2010 , this Court initiated the 
implementation proceedings . During hearing of the case, the 
Government was again required to take steps to revive all the cases, 
including those, which were being pursued outside the country before 
the prom ulgation of the NRO, but were abandoned in pursuance of the 
NRO. During the period f rom 30.03.2010 to 10.06.2010, the then 
Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs; 
Chairman, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and learned Attorney 
General were repeatedly asked to implement the judgment in Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan’s case . The matter continued to linger on and 
subsequently, the Federation of Pakistan filed a time barred review 
petition, which was dismissed vide judgment dated 25.11.2011 
reported as Federation of Pakistan v. Dr. Mobashir Hassan  (PLD 2012 
SC 106). The case regarding implementation of the judgment in Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan’s case  was again taken up by a 5 -Member Bench and 
vide order dated 10.01.2012, the Bench  identified six differ ent options 
available to it to secure implementation of the judgment, including the 
Option No.2, under  which proceedings may be initiated against the 
Chief Executive of the Federation, i.e. the Prime Minister, the Federal 
Minister for Law, Justice and Huma n Rights Division and the Federal 
Secretary Law, Justice and Human Rights Division for committing 
contempt of this Court by persistently, obstinately and contumaciously 
resisting, failing or refusing to implement or execute in full the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  7 
directions issued by  this Court in its judgment delivered in Dr. 
Mobashir Hassa n’s case . It may not be lost sight that, apart from the 
other consequences, by virtue of the provisions of clauses (g) and (h) 
of Article 63(1) read with Article 113 of the Constitution , a possible  
conviction on such a charge may entail a disqualification from being 
elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament) or a Provincial Assembly for at least a period of five 
years. Then, a 7-Member Bench  issued a show cause no tice and later 
framed the charge against Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, the then Prime 
Minister of Pakistan, inter alia, for having willfully flouted, disregarded 
and disobeyed the direction given by this Court in Para 178  of the 
judgment in Dr. Mobashir Hassan ’s case  had committed contempt of 
Court within the meanings of Article 204(2) of the Constitution read 
with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 (Ordinance V 
of 2003). The Prime Minister denied the charge, and the matter was 
proceeded on to f ull hearing and ultimately, vide short order dated 
26.04.2012, he was convicted under Article 204(2) of the Constitution 
read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and 
sentenced under section 5 of the Ordinance to undergo imprisonment 
till rising of the Court. The detailed reasons of the said order were 
released on 08.05.2012. Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani  did 
not file an appeal against the said judgment  and thus accepted his 
conviction . A copy of the order dated 26.04.2012 was f orwarded by 
the Court office to the Speaker of the National Assembly . In the 
meantime , a petition was also filed by one Maulvi Iqbal Haider before 
the Speaker for making a reference to the Election Commission in 
terms of Article 63(2) of the Constitution. However, on 24.05.2012, 
i.e., a day before the expiry of the period of 30 days within which the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  8 
Speaker had to decide the question under  Article 63(2), she gave a 
ruling that no question of disqualification of the respondent had arisen 
pursuant to his conv iction by the Supreme Court.  
  
3.  Constitution Petitions No. 40 of 2012 etc. were filed before 
this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution challenging the 
above ruling of the Speaker with the assertions, inter alia, that after 
the judgment of the 7-Member Bench, the respondent  Prime Minister  
stood disqualified as a Member of the Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament) 
and had also ceased to be the Prime Minister on and from the day and 
time of his conviction. The Court vide short order dated 19.06.2012 
allowe d the petitions and declared that Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani had 
become disqualified from being a Member of the Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament) in terms of Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution on and 
from the date and time of pronouncement of the judgment of th is 
Court dated 26.04.2012 with all consequences, i.e. he also ceased to 
be the Prime Minister of Pakistan with effect from the said date and 
the office of the Prime Minister shall be deemed to be vacant 
accordingly. The Election Commission of Pakistan was required to issue 
notification of disqualification of Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani from being a 
Member of the Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament) with effect from 
26.4.2012. On 19.06.2012, the Election Commission of Pakistan issued 
notification of disqualification of  Syed Yousaf Raza Gi llani as Member 
National Assembly of Pakistan with effect from 26.04.2012 and in 
consequence thereof the notification dated 01.03.2008 to the extent of 
declaring him as returned candidate from National Assembly 
Constituency No. NA -151 M ultan-IV stood rescinded.  
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  9 
4.  The implementation proceedings in Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s 
case were fixed on 27.06.2012 when a 5 -Member Bench called upon 
the newly elected Prime Minister to cause a report to be submitted 
before the Court on 12.07.2012 regard ing compliance of the directions 
contained in Paragraphs No. 177 and 178 of the said judgment, failing 
which the Court might initiate appropriate action under the 
Constitution and the law. In the meanwhile, on 09.07.2012 , the 
Contempt of Court Bill, 2012 was tabled in the National Assembly after 
the relevant rules were suspended and it was passed the same day. 
The Bill was then placed before the Senate on 11.07.2012 where too it 
was passed the same day and the President also gave his assent to it 
the same d ay converting it into an Act of Parliament, which came into 
force w.e.f. 12.07.2012 . By section 13 of the  COCA 2012 , the COCA 
1976, Ordinance No. V of 2003 and Ordinance No. I of 2004 were 
repealed.   
 
5.  The instant Constitution Petitions were filed to ch allenge 
the constitutionality of the impugned legislation on the touchstone of 
Article 8(1) on the ground of being violative of Fundamental Rights 
and various other constitutional provisions. The petitions were heard

Court . Resultantly, COCA 2 012 was declared unconstitutional, void and 
non est, and in consequence whereof, following the dictum laid down 
in Attorney -General for Alberta v. Attorney -General for Canada  (AIR 
1948 PC 194) , it was declare d that the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 
2003 sha ll be deemed to have revived with effect from 12.07.2012, 
the day when COCA 2012  was enforced with all consequences.   
 
6.  Mr. M. Zafar, Sr. ASC for the petitioner in Constitution 
Petition No. 77 of 2012 has argued that the legislature cannot curtail 
power  of the superior courts conferred upon them under Article 204. 
The purpose of clause (3) of Article 204 under which the impugned 
legislation has been promulgated is to provide for and to regulate the 
system to achieve the object of paragraphs (a) to (d) of  clause (2) of 
Article 204 of the Constitution, namely, to punish any person who is 
found guilty of the commission of any of the acts mentioned therein. 
He has submitted that the concept of supremacy of Parliament, 
according to the Constitution, is limited , inasmuch as the Parliament 
can make only such laws which are not violative of Fundamental 
Rights. The test of constitutionality is test in the Constitution, and not 
in the Parliament. To elucidate the point, he stated that if a person is 
elected, he beco mes a representative of the people, but as a single Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  14 
person he cannot make any law. He has to be part of the relevant 
majority, i.e., simple majority in the case of an ordinary law, and two -
third majority in the case of amendment of the Constitution. 
Theref ore, if a Member of the House is not part of the requisite 
majority, he cannot make law. These are his limitations. He further 
argued that power of the Court to punish for its contempt is regulated 
by Article 204 itself. The immunity of any person is corre lated with the 
power of the Court. If the Court does not inquire from any person, he 
enjoys the immunity. But if the Court has power to inquire from him, 
he has no immunity. Article 190 of the Constitution provides that all 
judicial and executive authoriti es shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. 
This acting in aid of the Supreme Court is essentially in terms of the 
Constitution, therefore, an order passed by the Court cannot be 
thwarted. The order is to be implemented by the concerned authorities 
of the Go vernment because all those authorities are required to act in 
aid of the Supreme Court. He further argued that in presence of the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980, there was no need of framing any other 
rules by the Federal Government as is envisaged by section 1 2 of 
COCA 2012.    
 
7.  Mr. A.K. Dogar, Sr. ASC has argued that under Entry 55 
of the Federal Legislative List, Parliament can make laws about “the 
jurisdiction and powers of all courts” but only with respect to any of 
the matters in the said list and that  too, to the extent expressly 
authorized by, or under, the Constitution. Since under Article 204 
of the Constitution, the Parliament is not expressly authorized to 
make a law about the jurisdiction and powers of the subordinate Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  15 
officers acting in judicial capacity, therefore, the impugned Act in 
its entirety is ultra vires of Article 70 of the Constitution.  
 
8.  Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC has argued that Article 175 of 
the Constitution provides that n o Court shall have any jurisdiction save 
as is or may be co nferred by the Constitution or by or under any law. 
Since Article 204 confers specific powers and jurisdiction upon the 
Supreme Court and a High Court , therefore, the Parliament has no 
authority to curtail those powers and jurisdiction in view of Entry 55 of 
the Federal Legislative List. He has further argued that t he Parliament 
while enacting COCA 2012 under the purported exercise of powers 
conferred on it to regulate the exercise of jurisdiction under clause (3) 
of Article 204 has in fact gone to the poin t of prohibiting the exercise 
jurisdiction by the Court. Para (i) to proviso to section 3 completely 
takes away or prohibits the Supreme Court from initiating contempt of 
court proceedings against persons referred to in Article 248(1) as 
public office hold ers. This, according to the learned counsel, is way 
beyond the power of regulation  of jurisdiction and in fact amounts to 
usurpation, prohibition or negation of powers and jurisdiction of the 
Superior Courts.  The power to regulate does not mean or include  the 
power to prohibit. In support of the proportion, he has placed reliance 
on Arshad Mahmood v. Government of Punjab  PLD 2005 SC 193 (221). 
Therefore, the provisions of COCA 2012 whereby the power and 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court have been curtailed  in any manner 
whatsoever are unconstitutional.  
 
9.  Mr. Ikarm Chaudhry, ASC has argued that the impugned 
enactment is violative of Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List of the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  16 
Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, inasmuch as it encroaches upon 
domain and jurisdiction of the Superior Courts.   
 
10.  Mr. Rashid A. Rizvi, Sr. ASC has submitted that Entry 55 
does not empower the Parliament to curtail or limit the jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court nor does it empower the Parliament to legislate on 
matters r elating to contempt of Court.  Hence, the Parliament in 
enacting/promulgating COCA 2012 has exceeded its power and 
authority; therefore, the same is a colourable piece of legislation and 
void. He has referred to the cases of S.S. Bola v. B.D. Sardana  (AIR 
1997 SC 3127), Jaora Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. v. State of MP  (AIR 1966 
SC 416), Shankara Narayana, BR v. State of Mysore  (AIR 1966 SC 1571), 
R. S. Joshi v. Ajit Mills  (AIR 1977 SC 2279), Ashok Kumar  Alias Golu v. 
Union of India  (AIR 1991 SC 1792)  = [(1991) 3 SCC 498] , Robkar 
Adalat v. Sarfraz Alam  (1996 MLD 1752) and Constitutional Law of 
India By H.M. Seervai, Volume I, 4th Edition, Chapter III “Court and 
the Constitution” at pages 269 -275.   
 
11.  Mr. Abdul Rehman Siddiqui, ASC has argued that the Act is 
a void piece of legislation in terms of Article 8 and is beyond the 
legislative powers of the Parliament in terms of Article 204 read with 
Entry 55 of the Fourth Schedule. He  has further argued that t he under 
Act, the judiciary has been rendered powerless and  the 
implementation mechanism of orders of Superior Courts has been 
frustrated. If any authority of the Government does not implement an 
order, contempt proceedings are initiated, but henceforth if any 
authority will not implement the order, and a show cau se notice is 
issued to it, there will be automatic stay. Thus, the executive authority 
has been given precedence over the judicial authority and the power of Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  17 
judicial review has been away, which will lead to bad governance and 
anarchy.   
 
12.  Mr. Muhammad  Azhar Siddique, ASC has argued that 
Article 70(4) read with Entry 55 restricts the power of the Legislature 
in respect of the Supreme Court and confers power upon it to enlarge 
the jurisdiction of Supreme Court and confer supplemental powers. 
The impugned  contempt law seeks to take away the jurisdiction and 
powers of the Supreme Court conferred under Article 204 of the 
Constitution.  
 
13.  Ch. Afrasiab Khan, ASC stated that Article 204(3) allows 
the Parliament to regulate the exercise of power, but the pow er itself 
cannot be curtailed nor any exceptions can be created in it by means 
of an ordinary legislation. What can be regulated is the procedure for 
exercise of power, but even that would be subject to other Articles of 
the Constitution.  
 
14.  Mrs. Nasir a Iqbal, ASC has submitted that the power of the 
Supreme Court can only be enlarged and not contained. The impugned 
Act is a nullity in the eye of Constitution.  
 
15.   Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC appeared on behalf of Chairman, 
Executive Committee of the Pakist an Bar Council (PBC) and has stated 
that PBC is the apex statutory body of the lawyers, which has always 
stood with the judiciary for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule 
of law. The present law under challenge is the product of peculiar 
circumstance s and it has to be read and must be considered in its 
peculiar background. It is not Pakistan alone where there are 
differences of opinion between the judiciary and the Parliament, or Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  18 
vice versa. There has been considerably lengthy history behind it. He 
has argued that COCA 2012 is not at all in conformity with Article 204. 
It is inconsistent with Fundamental Rights. He stated that a s was 
earlier pointed out perhaps by Mr. Hamid Khan, though it has been 
enacted under Article 204, which defines the Court, as  the Supreme 
Court and a High Court, under clause (3) the Court has the power to 
make rules whereas the Parliament has the right to make a law to 
regulate the exercise of powers of the Supreme Court and a High 
Court. Since those powers do not provide quant um of punishment, 
obviously, the law may provide for quantum of punishment as well as 
the procedure. The COCA 2012 is meant for regulating the procedure 
of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Section 3 with all the 
defences provided therein is contrary to the Fundamental Rights. 
Section 2, 6 and 9 are violative of Fundamental Rights whereas 
sections 12 and 13 with respect to right of appeal and limitation are 
discriminatory, inasmuch as the accused in the contempt case remains 
present in court, therefore , there is no logic for providing limitation of 
60 days for appeal instead of 30 days, which is the normal period for 
filing an appeal.  
 
16.   Mr. Shahid Orakzai, petitioner in Constitution Petition No. 
99 of 2012 has argued that the word “law” occurring in Article 204(3) 
does not mean Act of Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament), but refers to a 
provincial law as defined in Article 260 of the Constitution. Therefore, 
it is violative of provincial autonomy. He has prayed that sections 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, and 10 of the i mpugned Act may be declared ultra vires of the 
Constitution.    
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  19 
17.   Mr. Zafarullah Khan Advocate, petitioner in person in 
Constitution Petition No. 97 of 2012 has, inter alia, argued that if any 
of the executive or judicial authorities does not act in a id of the 
Supreme Court in obedience to the mandate of Article 190 of the 
Constitution, they are amenable to the contempt jurisdiction of this 
Court under Article 204 of the Constitution, therefore, the impugned 
law is in direct conflict with Articles 190 and 204 of the Constitution.   
 
18.   Barrister Zafarullah Khan, Ch. Muhammad Ashraf Gujjar, 
ASC, Hashmat Ali Habib, Engineer Jamil Ahmed Malik, G.M. Chaudhry, 
Solicitor Muhammad Dawood, Syed Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi, Liaqat Ali 
Qureshi, Ghulam Mustafa and Muh ammad Jamil Rana have appeared 
in person and thrown challenge to the constitutionality of the 
impugned legislation on more or less same or similar grounds and 
most of them have adopted the arguments of Mr. Hamid Khan, Mr. 
Rashid A. Rizvi, and other learned  counsel for the petitioners.  
 
19.  Mr. Abdul Shakoor Paracha, ASC has argued that the 
Supreme Court under Article 204 of the Constitution has power to 
punish any person for its contempt, but the exercise of power is to be 
regulated by law framed by the P arliament in terms of clause (3) ibid. 
He has submitted that the word ‘regulate’ is not defined in the 
Constitution. He has referred to the meaning of the word ‘regulate’ 
given in Corpus Juris Secundum and the case of Robkar Adalat v. 
Sharaf Alam  (supra ).  
 
20.   Learned Attorney General has also argued that the 
exercise of power of the Court to punish for contempt is to be 
regulated by the Legislature and the scheme of Article 204(3) of the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  20 
Constitution does not allow the Supreme Court or a High Court  to 
choose its own law to regulate the exercise of its power. This matter is 
clearly left to the Legislature, which is the regulator in this case. The 
moment the law is framed by the Parliament, the rules, if any, will be 
subject to such and in case of any inco nsistency, the law will prevail 
over the rules framed by the Court. In other words, though the Court 
is allowed to frame rules to regulate its procedure, but the same will 
be subject to the law made by the Parliament.  
 
21.  We have heard the learned couns el for the petitioners and 
the respondent Federation of Pakistan  as well as the learned Attorney 
General. Before dealing with the points raised in the petitions, it is 
necessary to understand the concept of the power of the Court to 
punish for its contempt  from different sources and its evolution 
overtime. It is a special power, which authorizes the Judge to swiftly 
and promptly punish a person without recourse to a formal and 
lengthy trial.  The concept of “ contempt of Court ” has been subject of 
varying di scussion. To some, it is to uphold the majesty of law and the 
dignity of courts and protect their image in the eyes of the members of 
the public, whereas others have taken the view that it is merely not to 
vindicate the dignity of the Court or the person o f the Judge, but to 
prevent undue interference with the administration of justice. 
Therefore, the law empowers the courts of law to prevent by summary 
proceedings any attempt to interfere with the administration of justice. 
The jurisdiction of committing f or contempt is practically arbitrary and 
unlimited, which is to be exercised always with reference to the 
interests of the administration of justice and with the greatest 
reluctance and anxiety on the part of Judges to see whether there is Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  21 
no other mode wh ich is not open to the objection of arbitrariness, and 
which can be brought to bear upon the subject. The contempt 
jurisdiction is used only from a sense of duty and under the pressure 
of the public necessity. The object of contempt proceedings is not to 
afford protection to the Judges personally from imputations to which 
they may be exposed as individuals, but to keep the course of justice 
free and to ensure that law and order prevail in the courts. In this 
behalf, it is relevant to mention that Almighty A llah in Surah An -Nisā' 
has ordained that “But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] 
believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning 
that over which they dispute among themselves and then find 
within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged 
and submit in [full, willing] submission ” [4 : 65]. Thus, under 
Islamic law, a Qadi (Judge) ha s the power to punish contemners. 
According to a Hadith  of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), once a dispute 
arose between an Ansari  and Hazrat  Zubair  (R.A) on the issue of  
irrigation of land and the case came before the Holy Prophet (PBUH) 
for decision. As the land of Hazrat  Zubair  was situated before the land 
of Ansari , therefore, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) gave his verdict: “ O 
Zubair, first you irrigate your land and then le ave the water for the 
land of the Ansari ”. The Ansari objected to the decision that Hazrat  
Zubair  was the cousin of the Prophet (Peace be upon him), therefore, 
the decision was biased. On this, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) got 
annoyed and said, “ O Zubair! Irrig ate your land first and block the 
water until it reaches top of the wall ”. While interpreting this verse, 
the famous scholar  Allama Al -Qurtubi  wrote that if someone criticizes 
the Qadi and not his decision, the Qadi has the power to penalize him . 
Allama Ma verdi explained that the order of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) to Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  22 
block the water until it reached the wall was a punishment ( Taa’zir ). 
Similarly, Imam Shafi said, “if the parties quarrel before a Qadi, the 
Qadi should forbid them, if they continue, the Qadi should admonish 
them and on their refusal to obey, the Qadi should detain them 
according to the intensity of the quarrel. ( Adab-al-Qadi, Vol.I by 
Allama Mawardi ). Allama Muhammad Shaheer Arslan  in his book ‘ Al 
qaza w Al qaza ’ has reported that during the Abb asid Caliphate Qadi 
Abu ul Mofid  Saif ibn Jaber   convicted and sentenced a person for 
committing contempt of court  for abusing the Qadi in court room. Dr. 
Abdul Aziz Aamir, in his book, ‘ Al-Taa’zir Fi Shariah -al-Islamiya ’ has 
written that if the parties a buse each other before a Qadi, he should 
send them behind the bars or give any other punishment so that the 
dignity of the court should be maintained. See: Fikr-o-Nazar , for the 
Month of July, 1983, published by Idara  Tahqeeqat -e-Islami , Jamia 
Islamia , Islamabad.  
 
22.  The practice of punishing those who refuse to carry out its 
orders or scandalize the Courts or the Judges finds its traces in the 
ancient times. In western countries, the King was sovereign possessed 
of all legislative, administrative and ju dicial powers. The King would 
make all judicial decrees himself, but soon he assigned this task to 
Judges. So, a Judge while deciding a dispute between two parties was 
considered as the representative of the King and the judicial 
pronouncements were consid ered as the utterances of the sovereign. 
As such, disobedience of the order of a Court was considered contempt 
of the King and not that of the Court. Where a prisoner tried for high 
treason (1796) was acquitted, and on the verdict being pronounced, 
some pe rsons in court clapped their hands and huzzaed, one Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  23 
gentleman on being particularly observed by the court was fined 20 
pounds. [Stone’s case (Howell’s State Trials, vol. xxv, p. 1458)]. 
Nothing can be more indecent than to make any noise in a court of 
justice. Any noise close to, or so near the court, as to disturb their 
proceeding is a contempt of court. A stroke or blow in a court of 
justice, or even assaulting a judge sitting in the court, by drawing a 
weapon, without any blow struck, is punishable with the loss of the 
right hand, imprisonment for life, and forfeiture of goods and chattels, 
and of the profits of his lands during life. This was to instill fear and 
elicit obedience from all petitioners who came to the Court. A rescue of 
a prisoner from the courts, without striking a blow, is punished with 
perpetual imprisonment, and forfeiture of goods, and of the profits of 
lands during life; being looked upon as an offence of the same nature 
with the last; but only, as no blow is actually given, the amputa tion of 
the hand is excused. [Blackstone, vol. iv. pp. 124 & 125]. The 
amputation of the right hand was the common form of punishment at 
the time. One James Williamson was visited with the said punishment 
for throwing a stone at the Bench in Chester Castle . In 1681, the 
accused at the Salisbury Summer Assizes threw a brickbat at Chief 
Justice Richardson. He was hanged in the court, preceded by the 
offending hand being cut off and fixed to a scaffold. [ 2 Dyer 188 b 
(notes), cf. Oswald, James Francis, Contemp t of Court, Committal and 
Attachment and Arrest upon Civil Process, Bibliolife LLC, (2009) at 
pp.24 -25]. While the punishment has been modernized, courts in 
almost every country resort to contempt proceedings regularly.  
 
23.  In India, the High Courts whi ch were established under the 
Letters Patent, had the power to punish a contemner. Some doubts Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  24 
having arisen as to the power of the High Courts to punish 
contemners, the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926 (Act No. XII of 1926) 
was enacted. By means of Contempt o f Courts (Amendment) Act, 
1937 (Act No.XII of 1937), it was made applicable to all the Provinces 
of India. Section 2 of the Act empowered the High Courts of Judicature 
established by Letters Patent to exercise the same jurisdiction, power 
and authority in accordance with the same procedure and practice in 
respect of contempt of Courts subordinate to them as they had 
exercised in respect of their own contempt. It also invested the Chief 
Court with the powers of a High Court. Section 3 of the said Act 
provide d the limit of punishments by laying down that “[s]ave as 
otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, a 
contempt of Court may be punished with simple imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to six months, or with fine, which may e xtend 
to two thousand rupees, or with both.” Proviso to section 3 provided 
that an accused may be discharged or the punishment awarded may 
be remitted on apology being made to the satisfaction of the Court. It 
is noteworthy that the said Act did not provid e procedure but by 
reference adopted the procedure and the practice, which were 
obtaining in the High Courts of Judicature established under the 
Letters Patent.   
 
24.  Article 176 of t he Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan  1956 empowered the Supreme Court and the High Courts to 
deal with the contemners in the following terms: -   
“176. The Supreme Court and each High Court shall 
be a Court of record and shall have all the powers of 
such a Court, including the power to make any order Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  25 
for the in vestigation or punishment of any contempt 
of itself.”  
 
Item No.16 of the Federal List ( Fifth Schedule of the said Constitution ) 
provided for legislation on the constitution, organization, jurisdiction 
and powers of the Supreme Court (including contempt of  such Court) 
and the fees taken herein; persons entitled to practice before the 
Supreme Court , which showed that the contempt of court matters 
were to be dealt with under the ordinary law, prevailing at that time. 
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic o f Pakistan of 1956 was 
abrogated in 1958 and a new Constitution , namely, Constitution of the 
Republic (later amended as Islamic Republic) of Pakistan,  was framed 
in 1962. Article 123 of the said Constitution made a provision for the 
contempt of Court as fo llows: -  
“123. (1) In this Article, ‘Court’ means the Supreme Court 
or a High Court.  
(2)  A Court shall have power to punish any person who, 
--  
(a)  abuses, interferes with or obstructs the 
process of the Court in any way or disobeys 
any order of the Co urt; 
(b)  scandalizes the Court or otherwise does 
anything which tends to bring the Court or a 
Judge of the Court into hatred, ridicule or 
contempt;  
(c)  does anything which tends to prejudice the 
determination of a matter pending before the 
Court; or  
(d)  does any other thing which, by law, constitutes 
contempt of the Court.  
 
(3)  The exercise of the power conferred on a Court by 
this Article may be regulated by law and, subject to law, 
by rules made by the Court.”  
 
After the abrogation of the 1962 Const itution, Interim Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was framed in 1972, Article 206 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  26 
whereof made provision regarding contempt of Court in the terms it 
existed in the 1962 Constitution. Then came the Constitution  of the 
Islamic Republic of Pak istan of 1973, Article 204 thereof as originally 
enacted provided as under: -  
“204. Contempt of Court. -- (1) In this Article, ‘Court’ 
means the Supreme Court or a High Court.  
(2)  A Court shall have power to punish any person who -- 
(a)  abuses, interfere s with or obstructs the process of 
the Court in any way or disobeys any order of the 
Court; or  
(b)  scandalizes the Court or otherwise does anything 
which tends to bring the Court or a Judge in relation 
to his office into hatred, ridicule or contempt; or  
(c)  does anything which tends to prejudice the 
determination of a matter pending before the Court; 
or 
(d)  does any other thing, which, by law, constitutes 
contempt of the Court.  
 
Explanation. – Fair comment made in good faith and in the 
public interest on the working of the Court or any of its 
final decisions after the expiry of the period of limitation 
for appeal, if any, shall not constitute contempt of the 
Court.  
 
(3)  The exercise of the power conferred on a Court by 
this Article may be regulated by law and, subject to law, 
by rules made by the Court.”  
 
It is pertinent to mention here that Article 176 of the 1956 
Constitution neither defined contempt of Court nor did it provide any 
defences to it. It merely empowered the Supreme Court and the High 
Courts to make an order for the investigation or punishment for their 
contempt. On the contrary, Article 123 of the Constitution of 1962 not 
only empowered the Supreme Court and the High Courts to punish any 
person for contempt but also elaborated what const ituted contempt by 
defining the same in the above quoted paragraphs (a) to (d). Clause 
(3) of Article 123 of the 1962 Constitution provided that the exercise Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  27 
of the power conferred on a Court by the aforesaid Article may be 
regulated by law and subject to law by the rules made by the Court. 
Article 204 of the Constitution adopted Article 123 of 1962 Constitution 
and also provided Explanation after paragraph (d) of clause (2) 
thereof, which laid down that fair comments made in good faith and in 
the public in terest on the working of the Court or any of its final 
decisions after the expiry of the period of limitation for appeal, if any, 
shall not constitute contempt of Court. The Constitution (Fifth 
Amendment) Act, 1976 , which was passed on 16.09.1976  to be 
effective from 01.12.1976, amended Article 204 and substituted 
clauses (2) & (3) by new clause (2) as under: -  
(2)  A Court shall have the power to punish a person for 
contempt of court in accordance with law.  
 
25.  By the President’s Order No. 14 of 1985, the original 
Article 204 was brought back with effect from 02.03.1985. However, 
Explanation to clause (2) as originally enacted was omitted. The said 
PO was affirmed by the Parliament by means of Article 270A under the 
Constitution (Eighth amendment) Act, 1985.  
 
26.  In pursuance of the provisions of Article 204, the 
Contempt of Court Act, 1976 was promulgated, whereby the Contempt 
of Courts Act, 1926 (XII of 1926) was repealed.  
 
27.  On 10.02.1998, when Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the 
then Prime Minister  of Pakistan was facing contempt proceedings 
before the Supreme Court, COCA 1976 was amended by the Contempt 
of Courts (Amendment) Act, 199 7 (Act II of 1998) , which made 
provision for filing of intra -court appeal against the issuance of show 
cause notice o r an original order including an interim order passed by Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  28 
a Bench of the Supreme Court to a large r bench consisting of all the 
remaining available Judges of the Court within the country and that 
the operation of the impugned show  cause notice or order shall  remain 
suspended until the final disposal of the matter. The constitutionality 
of the above newly inserted provision of intra -court appeal was 
challenged before this Court in Constitution Petition No.43 of 1997 
wherein the operation of the impugned legisl ation was suspended  vide 
order dated 20.11.1997 . Later on, since the Bill was converted into Act 
of Parliament , therefore, the petition was dismissed  in view of this 
technicality  vide judgment reported as Navid Malik v. President of 
Pakistan  (1998 SCMR 191 7).   
 
28.  On 27.10.1998, the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 1998 
(Ordinance X of 1998) was promulgated whereby COCA 1976 was 
repealed. In the said Ordinance, contempt of Court was categorized as 
“civil contempt”, “criminal contempt” and “judicial contempt”  as per 
definition clause [section 2(b), (c) & (d)], which read as under:  -  
 “(b) “civil contempt” means the wilful flouting or 
disregard of – 
(i)  an order, whether interim or final, a judgment 
of decree of a court;  
(ii) a writ or order issued by a Court  in the 
exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction;  
(iii)  an undertaking given to, and recorded by, a 
court; and  
(iv)  the process of a court;  
 
(c) “criminal contempt” means the doing of any 
act with intent to, or having the effect of, obstructing the  
administration of justice;  
 
(d)  “judicial contempt” means the scandalization of 
a court and includes personalized criticism of a judge while 
holding office.”  
 
The aforesaid Ordinance X of 1998 stood repealed after expiration of 
120 days by virtue of Ar ticle 89 of the Constitution. Thereafter, on Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  29 
10.07.2003, the Contempt of Court Ordinance No. IV of 2003 was 
promulgated, which expired on 09.11.2003. On 15.12.2003, the 
Contempt of Court Ordinance No. V of 2003 was promulgated, which 
was made applicable wi th effect from 09.11.2003, the day the earlier 
Ordinance had expired. It is pertinent to mention here that by means 
of Ordinance No. V of 2003, COCA 1976 was again repealed. During 
the currency of the said Ordinance V of 2003 , Article 270AA was 
inserted in to the Constitution on 31.12.2003 by means of the 
Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 2003. Clause (3) of the 
said Article provided that all Proclamations, President's Orders, 
Ordinances , Chief Executive's Orders, laws, regulations, enactments, 
including amendments in the Constitution, Notifications, Rules, Orders 
or bye -laws in force immediately before the date on which this Article 
comes into force shall continue in force until altered, repealed or 
amended by the competent authority . As such, by vir tue of said 
Article, all legislative instruments including the Contempt of Court 
Ordinance No. V of 2003 mentioned therein were continued in force 
until “altered, repealed or amended by the competent authority”.  
 
29.  On 15.07.2004, the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2004 
(Ordinance No. I of 2004) was promulgated, which was made 
applicable with effect from 15.04.2004, the day when the Ordinance 
No.V of 2003 would have expired in the ordinary course  knowing well 
that Contempt of Court Ordinance No. V of 2003 had been protected 
under Article 270AA of the Constitution. By means of Ordinance No. I 
of 2004, COCA 1976 was again repealed, but not the Ordinance V of 
2003, presumably on account of its supposed expiry after a period of 
120 days as provided in Article 8 9 of the Cons titution. The Ordinance Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  30 
No. I of 2004 was repealed on 14.11.2004 on expiry of 120 days. It is 
pertinent to mention  that Article 270AA was reinserted by the 
Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act 2010.  However , by 
Nineteenth and Twentieth Cons titutional Amendments, no change was 
brought about in Articles 270AA .  
 
30.  Article 204(3) of the Constitution provides that the 
exercise of the power conferred on a Court by this Article to punish for 
its contempt may be regulated by law and, subject to law, by rules 
made by the Court. It is, therefore,  necessary in the first instance to 
understand the meaning of the word ‘regulate’ in the first instance  
from various sources : -   
  Black ’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition , p. 1156  -   
“regulate ”: To fix, est ablish, or control; to adjust by rule, 
method, or established mode; to direct by rule or 
restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws. The 
power of Congress to regulate commerce is the power to 
enact all appropriate legislation for its protectio n or 
advancement; to adopt measures to promote its growth 
and insure its safety; to foster , protect, control and 
restrain.   
 
  Corpus Juris Secundum , Vol. LXXVI, p. 610 - 
“regulate”:  The word ‘ regulate ’ is derived from the Latin 
words ‘rego’  and ‘regula ’. It is a word of broad import, 
having a broad meaning, and is very comprehensive in 
scope. The word is difficult to define in other terms 
because it involves a conception for which it stands more 
accurately than any synonym and there is diversity of 
opinion  as to its meaning and its application to a particular 
state of acts. Some Courts giving to the term a somewhat 
restricted and others giving to it a liberal construction.   
  
The word ‘r egulate ’ is further defined as meaning to put or 
keep in good order; to  methodize; to arrange; to dispose; 
to produce uniformity of motion or action. The term is also 
employed as meaning to foster; to protect; to provide for.  
  
“The word ‘regulate ’ ordinarily indicates not so much the 
creation or establishment of a new thing as the arranging 
in proper order and controlling that which already exists Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  31 
and it has been held to contemplate or imply the continued 
existence of the subject -matter to be regulated.”  
  
Words and Phrases by West Publishing Co. , Vol. 36-
A, p. 303 -305 –  
 
“A power to regulate implies a continued existence of the 
matter to be regulated.  
  
“To ‘regulate ’ in the sense intended is to foster, protect 
and control the commerce with appropriate regard to the 
welfare of those who are immediately concerned as well as 
the public at large and to promote its growth and insure its 
safety.  
  
“While the word ‘regulate ’ has been given a 
comprehensive meaning and construed to signify 
both Government and restriction thereby including in 
an act all subject germane to the object  named it 
does not so much imply creating a new thing as 
arranging in proper order and controlling that which 
already exists .  
  
“To ‘regulate ’ is to fix or control the manner in which a 
thing is to be done , to prescribe a rule or method for doing 
it. It i s comprehensive enough to cover the exercise of 
authority over the whole subject to be regulated .  
 
The Superior Courts have interpreted the word ‘regulate’ in various 
pronouncements. In Messrs East and West Steamship Co. v. Pakistan 
through Secretary to G overnment of Pakistan  (PLD 1958 SC  41) the 
observations from National Labour Relations Board v. Jones and Laugh 
in Steel Corporation  (301 US 1  at p.  37) that the power to regulate 
implies a power to foster, to protect, control and restrain, were quoted 
with approval  and it was held that if the Constitution gives to the 
Legislature the power to regulate a trade by a licensing system, it 
must follow that the power to prohibit vests in the Legislature insofar 
as the trade under such system may only be carried on by the licensed 
persons or corporations. Also s ee Malik Asghar v. Government of 
Punjab  (PLD 2003  Lahore 73) . The expression “power to regulate” was 
also considered in Arshad Mahmood ’s case  (supra ) and it was held that 
the power to regulate does not mean  or include power to prohibit. In Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  32 
Robkar Adalat v. Sarfraz Alam  (supra ), the High Court of AJK has held 
that “ the word ‘regulate’, connotes  making of the law prescribing the 
manner, method and procedure of the exercise of the power by the 
Court, not contro lling its power, but arranging the same in a way that 
a fair trial is ensured. It was further held that e ven if the law and rules 
are not framed for regulating the power, the superior Courts are still at 
liberty to exercise the power vested in them under t his section to 
punish any person for contempt of Court; and even after framing the 
law and rule, if any of their provision restricts, curtails or abridges the 
powers of Courts, that shall be ignored as non -existent and the Courts 
may proceed in the matter.  Also see VSR & Oil Mills v. State of A.P.  
(AIR 1964 SC 1781), State of U.P. v. M/s  Hindustan Aluminium Corpn.  
[AIR 1979 SC 1459] , Jiyajeerao Cotton Mills Ltd.. v. Madhya Pradesh 
Electricity Board  [1989 (Suppl.) 2 SCC 52], U.P. Co -Operative Cane 
Unions v. West U.P. Sugar Mills Association  (AIR 2004 SC 3697) = 
[(2004) 5 SCC 430], Union Of India v. M/s Asian Food Industries  (AIR 
2007 SC 750) = [(2006) 13 SCC 542],  Jibendra Kishore v. Province of 
East Pakistan  (PLD 1957 SC 41).  
 
31.  The question of regulatin g the exercise of power of the 
Court under Article 204(3) was considered  by Mr. Justice  Ajmal Mian, J 
(as he then was, later CJ) in the case of State v. Khalid Masood (PLD 
1996 SC 42), wherein he held that clause (3) provides that the 
exercise of the power  conferred on a Court by this Article may be 
regulated by law and subject to law by rules made by the Court, but it 
does not mean that a statute can control or curtail the power 
conferred on the superior Courts by this Article, nor does it mean that 
in the  absence of a statute on the above subject, the above Article will Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  33 
be inoperative. He further observed that the law referred to in clause 
(3) of the above Article relates to procedural matters or matters which 
have not been provided for.  
 
32.  As regards the contention of the learned Attorney General 
that COCA 1976, which model was adopted in COCA 2012 had held the 
field for almost a quarter of a century, but the same was never 
challenged by anyone, it is true that constitutionality of the said law on 
the touchstone of any provision  of the Constitution was never tested 
by this Court , but absence of challenge to any particular law or a 
provision thereof in the past would hardly make it immune to any 
challenge in the future . However , it may be pointed out tha t Khalid 
Masood ’s (supra ), Ajmal Mian, J, (as he then was, later CJ,) in passing 
commented on the implications of the words ‘regulated by law’ used in 
clause (3) of Article 204 of the Constitution and left the question 
whether any provision of the Act is i n conflict with the above Article 
open to examination in an appropriate case. It may also be pointed out 
that the said learned Judge once again had the occasion of examining 
the provisions of COCA 1976 in the case of Masroor Ahsan v. Ardeshir 
Cowasjee (PLD 1998 SC 823) wherein he held as under: -  
“75.  Before concluding the above discussion, I may 
observe that the legal position which has emerged on 
account of the above discussion of the provisions of the 
Constitution, the Contempt of Court Act, the Supreme  
Court Rules and the case -law of Pakistani and foreign 
jurisdictions in nutshell is as under: - 
PROCEDURAL : 
  
(i)  That in view of subsection (1) of section 7 of the 
Contempt of Court Act read with Rule 4 of Order 
XXVII of the Supreme Court Rules, a show -cause 
notice for contempt should contain the substance of 
the charge indicating the offending portion of the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  34 
speech/writing which prima facie has been found to 
be contemptuous.  
  
(ii)  That the old view, that a Judge in respect of whom 
contempt proceedings w ere initiated could hear the 
contempt case himself, in view of the fact that it was 
a special jurisdiction (sui generis) stands modified by 
section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act which 
envisages that a Judge including the Chief Justice 
should not hear the matter if the contempt relates to 
his person subject to an exception that if contempt is 
committed in face of the Court or the Judge or the 
Chief Justice, he may proceed immediately against 
the contemner and may punish him.  
  
SUBSTANTIVE LAW : 
  
(i)  That s ince the freedom of speech under Article 66 of 
the Constitution is subject to the Constitution, as a 
corollary, it must follow that the freedom of speech 
of a Member of the Parliament is subject to the 
contempt law under Article 204 of the Constitution 
and, therefore, the above privilege is not absolute.  
  
(ii)  That in view of Article 68 of the Constitution read 
with clause (c) of sub -rule (2) of Rule 248 of the 
National Assembly Rules, the Speaker is obliged not 
to allow a Member to discuss the conduct o f any 
Judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court in the 
discharge of his duties and if a Member does it in 
violation of the above provisions, the Speaker is 
expected to take any of the actions envisaged under 
Rules 267, 268 and 269 of the aforesaid Rules 
discussed hereinabove.  
  
(iii)  That an expunction order in respect of the offending 
portion of a speech at the fag -end of the session 
would not be a defence to an action under Article 
204 of the Constitution for the reasons discussed in 
the body of the ab ove judgment.  
  
(iv)  That Article 204 of the Constitution relating to the 
contempt of Court is to be construed in conjunction 
with Articles 19 and 66 thereof keeping in view the 
modern trend about contempt law obtaining in the 
world to protect and projec t the freedom of speech 
and expression and the freedom of press subject to 
reasonable restrictions.  
 
(v) That the power of contempt should be used sparingly 
and only in serious cases and that the Court should 
not be either unduly touchy or over -astute in 
discovering new varieties of contempt for “its 
usefulness depends on the wisdom and restraint with 
which it is exercised”.   Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  35 
  
(vi) That fair comments about the general working of 
Courts made in good faith in the public interest and 
in temperate language a nd fair comments on the 
merits of a decision of a Court made after the 
pendency of the proceedings in a case in good faith 
and in temperate language without impugning the 
integrity or impartiality of the Judge are protected 
under Exceptions (i) and (ii) to  section 3 of the 
Contempt of Court Act.  
 
(vii)  That similarly subject to a prohibition of publication 
under section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act or 
under any other law for the time being in force, the 
publication of fair and substantially accurate 
reporting of any judicial proceedings is also 
protected under Exception (iii) to section 3 of the 
said Act.”  
 
33.  Having considered the dictionary meanings of the word 
‘regulate’ and the interpretation given to it by the Superior Courts in 
the different jud gments noted hereinabove, we reaffirm the law laid 
down in Khalid Masood’s case  (supra ) that the law referred to in Article 
204(3) relates to procedural matters or matters which have not been 
provided for  and though the exercise of the power conferred on a  
Court by this Article may be regulated by law and subject to law by 
rules made by the Court, but it does not mean that a statute can 
control or curtail the power conferred on the Superior Courts under 
this Article  nor in the absence of a statute on the ab ove subject, the 
said Article will be inoperative.   
 
34.  At this juncture, it may also be noticed that Entry 55 of the 
Federal Legislative List ( Fourth Schedule to the Constitution ) 
authorizes the Parliament to make law on jurisdiction and powers of all 
courts with respect to any of the matters in the said List to such extent 
as is expressly authorized by or under the Constitution. Thus, the said 
Entry on the one hand limits the legislative power of the Parliament to Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  36 
the making of any law on the jurisdict ion and powers of the Supreme 
Court, and on the other hand empowers the Parliament to make law 
for enlargement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the 
conferring of supplemental powers.  
 
35.  The Constitution of Pakistan confers upon the superior  
Courts power and jurisdiction under Articles 199 and 184(3) to 
examine the constitutionality of the executive and the legislative 
actions. In Mehram Ali v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1998 SC 1445) 
this Court adjudged the constitutionality of various prov isions of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and declared sections 5(2)(i), 14, 19(10)(b), 
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 35, 37 and 40 of the Act to be invalid being 
violative of various Articles of the Constitution, namely, Articles 10, 
13(b), 25, 175 & 203 of the Co nstitution and the principle of 
independence of judiciary enshrined therein. Similarly, in the case of 
Liaqat Hussain v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1999 SC 504) it was 
held that Court cannot strike down a statute on the ground of mala 
fides, but the same can be struck down on the ground that it is 
violative of a constitutional provision. Consequently, the Court 
declared section 6 of the Pakistan Armed Forces (Acting in Aid of the 
Civil Power) Ordinance, 1998 in so far as it allowed the establishment 
of Mil itary Courts for trial of civilians charged with the offences 
mentioned in the Schedule to the said Ordinance to be unconstitutional 
and without lawful authority. Also see Civil Aviation Authority v. Union 
of Civil Aviation Employees  (PLD 1997 SC 781), Elahi Cotton Mills Ltd. 
v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1997 SC 582), Pir Sabir Shah v. Shad 
Muhammad Khan  (PLD 1995 SC 66), Federation of Pakistan v. Shaukat 
Ali Mian   (PLD 1999 SC 1026), Wattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  37 
(PLD 2006 SC 697), Muhammad Mube en-us-Salam v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2006 SC 602), Muhammad Nasir Mahmood v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2009 SC 107), Dr. Mobashir Hassan  
(supra ) and All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2012 SC 1).  
 
36.  Under Article 70 of the Constitution, the Parliament is 
authorized to make laws with respect to any matter in the Federal 
Legislative List by adopting procedure laid down in the Constitution. 
Entry No.55 of the Fourth Schedule, in terms of Article 70(4), 
prescribes that la ws can be promulgated pertaining to jurisdiction and 
powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of 
the matters in this List and, to such extent as is expressly authorized 
by or under the Constitution, the enlargement of the jurisdi ction 
(emphasis provided) of the Supreme Court, and the conferring thereon 
of supplemental powers . Under this Entry, the Constitution maker 
consciously separated the Supreme Court from all other courts. A plain 
reading of the words of this Entry, particula rly, the portion, where 
emphasis has been provided, not only creates distinction between the 
Supreme Court and other courts, but also speaks in respect of 
enlargement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and conferring of 
supplemental powers. The liter al rule of interpretation of the 
Constitution and statutes, also known as  the  golden rule  of 
interpretation , is that the words and phrases used therein should be 
read keeping in view their plain meaning. Reference in this behalf may 
be made to the case of Syed Mukhtar Hussain Shah  v. Mst. Saba 
Imtiaz  (PLD 2011 SC 260), Mumtaz Hussain  v. Dr. Nasir Khan  
(2010  SCMR  1254), Kamaluddin Qureshi  v. Ali International Co.  (PLD Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  38 
2009 SC 367), Pakistan through Secretary Finance  v. M/s Lucky 
Cement  (2007 SCMR 1367), Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Ministry of Finance  v. Haji Muhammad Sadiq  (PLD 2007 SC 67), 
Mushtaq Ahmed v. Secretary, Ministry of Defence  (PLD 2007 SC 405), 
Syed Masroor Shah v. State  (PLD 2005 SC 173), Federation of 
Pakistan v.  Ammar Textile Mill s (Pvt.) Ltd.  (2002 SCMR  510), World 
Trade Corporation v.  Excise & Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal  
(1999 SCMR  632) and State Cement Corporation of Pakistan Ltd. v. 
Collector of Customs, Karachi  (1998 SCMR 2207).  
 
37.  We believe that there could not be any o ther view except 
that the Constitution favours enlargement of the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court and conferment of supplemental powers. The 
enlargement of jurisdiction is to be understood under the Constitution 
that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court  may be extended 
territorially like adhering to Articles 246 and 247 as well as to confer 
further judicial powers and also conferring supplemental powers to 
expand the scope of the powers, which it is already exercising. Under 
the scheme of the Constitutio n, the Supreme Court is empowered to 
deal with the matters falling within various types of jurisdiction 
conferred upon it, i.e., original, appellate, advisory and review. By 
virtue of Article 189 of the Constitution, a decision of the Supreme 
Court to the extent it decides a question of law is binding on all other 
Courts in Pakistan whereas under Article 190 of the Constitution all 
executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan shall act in aid 
of the Supreme Court. Article 190 has been interpreted by this Court 
in a large number of cases. See Akhunzada Behrawar Saeed, ASC v. 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, CJP  (1998 SCMR 173), Shahid Orakzai v. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  39 
Nawaz Sharif  (PLD 1999 SC 46), Human Rights Case No. 13 -L of 2006  
(2006 SCMR 1769),  Khalid Rashid  v. Kamran Lasha ri, chairman, CDA  
(2010 SCMR 594), Regarding Corruption in Hajj Arrangements in 
2010: In Re  (PLD 2011 SC 963), Iffat Jabeen  v. District Education 
Officer  (2011 SCMR 437), Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani  v. Assistant 
Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan  (PLD 2012 SC 466) and Suo 
Motu Case No.4 of 2010  (PLD 2012 SC  553).  
 
38.  Article 204(2)(d) and Article 204(3) confer two different 
types of power on the Parliament.  Under the former, the Parliament is 
empowered to make law providing for more offences of contempt o f 
the Court, which is clear from the wording used therein, i.e. “does any 
other thing which,  by law , constitutes contempt of the Court ”. In other 
words, here the Parliament is empowered to add to the offences 
already described in Article 204 (2)(a), (b) & ( c). On the other hand, 
under Article 204 (3) the Parliament is empowered to make law to 
regulate the exercise of power conferred on a Court under  this Article.  
Thus, these are two distinct areas of legislation  envisaged by Article 
204. The Preamble to COCA 2012 explicitly provides that it is 
expedient to repeal and re -enact a law of contempt in exercise of the 
powers conferred by clause (3) of Article 204 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  Thus, the legislation under scrutiny has 
been enact ed under Article 204(3), which is restricted to provid ing for 
matters enumerated therein, namely, to regulat e the exercise of 
power. It is noteworthy that COCA 2012 has not been enacted by the 
Parliament in exercise of the power conferred on it by Article 204(2)(d) 
where a different set of power is envisaged , namely, to add to the 
offence of contempt of Court  already defined in paragraphs (a), (b) & Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  40 
(c) of clause (2) ibid. A perusal of section 3 of COCA 2012 shows that 
on the one hand, certain kinds of offe nces enumerated in Article 204 
have not been incorporated therein, but at the same time,  under the 
proviso to the said section, various exceptions and defences have been 
created . This is clearly excess of jurisdiction , inasmuch as the 
Parliament could not do it while exercising its power under clause (3) . 
So, on this score too,  parts of section 3 , insofar as they create 
exceptions and defences to the controlling provision of the 
Constitution, namely, Article  204(2)(a)(b) & (c) are ultra vires of the 
Constit ution.     
 
39.   It may be noted that exercise of jurisdiction by the 
Supreme Court and the High Courts also include s enforcement of 
Fundamental Rights enshrined in Articles 9 to 28 Chapter  1 of Part II 
of the Constitution  under Articles 184(3) and 199  respectively . 
However , the jurisdiction of Supreme Court is free from technicalities 
as the Supreme Court while deciding a case under Article 184(3) for 
enforcement of Fundamental Rights  would be taking into consideration 
only two conditions  enumerated in the  above Article , viz., (1) 
involvement of question of public importance (2) with reference to 
enforcement of Fundamental Rights . Besides, the Supreme Court, i n 
exercise of jurisdiction under Article 187(1) of the Constitution subject 
to clause (2) of Articl e 175, has have the power  to issue such 
directions, orders or decrees as may be necessary for doing complete 
justice in any case or matter pending before it, including an order for 
the purpose of securing the attendance of any person or the discovery 
or production of any document. This Article of the Constitution itself 
has enlarged the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Reference may be Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  41 
made to Dr. Mobashir  Hassan ’s case , wherein following observations 
have been made:  -   
“85. Essentially, the above guidel ines/directions for 
expeditious disposal of cases were issued by this Court, 
in exercise of its powers under Article 187 of the 
Constitution, which provides that Supreme Court shall 
have power to issue such directions, orders or decrees, 
as may be necessar y for doing complete justice in any 
case or matter pending before it, including an order for 
the purpose of securing the attendance of any person or 
the discovery or production of any document. This Article 
of the Constitution has been interpreted in so ma ny 
cases. However, reference is being made only to Sabir 
Shah ’s case (PLD 1995 SC 66). Relevant para. therefrom 
is reproduced hereinbelow for convenience: - 
“10. The Supreme Court is the apex Court. It is the 
highest and the ultimate Court under the 
Constit ution. In my view the inherent and plenary 
power of this Court which is vested in it by virtue 
of being the ultimate Court, it has the power to do 
complete justice without in any manner infringing 
or violating any provision of law. While doing 
complete jus tice this Court would not cross the 
frontiers of the Constitution and law. The term 
"complete justice" is not capable of definition with 
exactitude. It is a term covering variety of cases 
and reliefs which this Court can mould and grant 
depending upon the facts and circumstances of the 
case. While doing complete justice formalities and 
technicalities should not fetter its power. It can 
grant ancillary relief, mould the relief within its 
jurisdiction depending on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, take  additional evidence 
and in appropriate cases even subsequent events 
may be taken into consideration. Ronald Rotunda 
in his book “Treatise o n Constitutional Case 
Substance”  (Second  Edition), Volume 2 at page 90 
has stated that “The Supreme Court is an esse nce 
of a continual Constitutional convention". The 
jurisdiction and the power conferred on the 
Supreme Court does empower it to do complete 
justice by looking to the facts, circumstances and 
the law governing a particular case. Article 187 
does not confer any jurisdiction. It recognizes 
inherent power of an apex Court to do complete 
justice and issue orders and directions to achieve 
that end. Inherent ju risdiction is vested in the High 
Court and subordinate Courts while dealing with 
civil and criminal cases  by virtue of provisions of 
law. The inherent jurisdiction of this Court to do 
complete justice cannot be curtailed by law as it 
may adversely affect the independence of judiciary Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  42 
and the fundamental right of person to have free 
access to the Court for ach ieving complete justice. 
This enunciation may evoke a controversy that as 
Article 175(2) restricts Article 187 it will create 
conflict between the two. There is no conflict and 
both the Articles can be read together. The conflict 
in the provisions of the C onstitution should not be 
assumed and if apparently there seems to be any, 
it has to be interpreted in a harmonious manner by 
which both the provisions may co -exist. One 
provision of the Constitution cannot be struck down 
being in conflict with the other p rovision of the 
Constitution. They have to live together, exist 
together and operate together. Therefore, while 
interpreting jurisdiction and power of the superior 
Courts one should look to the fundamental rights 
conferred and the duty cast upon them under  the 
Constitution. A provision like Article 187 cannot be 
read in isolation but has to be interpreted and read 
harmoniously with other provisions of the 
Constitution. In my humble view , this Court while 
hearing appeal under a statute has the jurisdiction 
and power to decide the question of vires of the 
statute under which the appeal has arisen and can 
even invoke Article 184(3) in appropriate cases.”  
As it has been pointed out hereinabove,  the power and authority of the 
Parliament  to enlarge the jurisdictio n of the Supreme Court and to 
confer supplement al powers, inter alia , is aimed at ensur ing 
supremacy of the law through the system of administration of justice. 
Inasmuch as , to strengthen the enforcement  of the c onstitutional 
provisions and the decisions p ronounced by the Supreme Court under 
Article 190 of Constitution, all the executive and the judicial authorities 
throughout Pakistan have been commanded by the Constitution to act 
in aid of the Supreme Court. On a cursory glance at some of the 
provisions n oted hereinabove and without making reference  to the 
other constitutional provisions , for the sake of brevity , it is concluded 
that Legislature while enacting any law pertaining to the jurisdiction 
and the powers of the Supreme Court has an obligation to s how 
obedience to the Constitution and the law as lawgive rs, like other 
functionaries , have taken oath under Article 65 of the Constitution to Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  43 
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, therefore, Legislature 
while legislating or amending the law is dut y bound to strictly follow 
the Constitution because being the chosen representatives of the 
people , they have to act according to the will of the people of Pakistan  
and have to establish an order , which  enabl es the State to exercise its 
powers  for the bene fit of citizens . Such constitutional obligation clearly 
postulates that whatever law shall be enacted , it must have nexus with 
the welfare of the citizens and the Parliamentarians , being the trustees 
under the Constitution  of the will of the people of Paki stan, have  to 
watch the interest s of the  beneficiaries  - the people of Pakistan.  
Therefore , people of Pakistan earnestly expect that the Parliament is 
doing nothing without a reason for passing an Act or enactment within 
it.  
 
40.  Barrister Zafarullah Kha n, Advocate High Court, petitioner 
in person in Constitution Petition No. 97 of 2012, has argued that to 
interpret various provisions of COCA 2012 and to determine their 
compatibility with the Constitution, the principle  expounded in the 
Heydon’s case  [(15 84) 3 Rep. 7b]  as discussed and elaborated in 
Section 3 titled “The Context – External Circumstances of the treatise 
“Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes”  will be required to be kept in 
mind.  We have considered his argument. The principle  is that a thing  
which is within the letter of a statute will, generally, be construed as 
not within the statute unless it be also within the real intention of the 
legislature, and the words, if sufficiently flexible, must be construed in 
the sense which, if less correct grammatically, is more in harmony 
with that intention. On the a im, scope and object of an Act, the 
Heydon’s case  lays down that t he literal construction then, has, in Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  44 
general, but prima  facie reference. To arrive at the real meaning, it is 
always necessary  to get an exact conception of the aim, scope, and 
object of the whole Act; to consider, according to Lord Coke  –   
(1)  What was the law before the Act was passed;  
(2)  What was the mischief or defect for which the law 
had not provided;  
(3)  What remedy  Parliament has appointed; and  
(4)  The reason of the remedy.  
 
According to another authority:  “in order properly to interpret any 
statute it is as necessary now as it was when Lord Coke reported 
Heydon’s Case to consider how the law stood when the statu te to be 
construed was passed, what the mischief was for which the old law did 
not provide, and the remedy provided by the statute to cure that 
mischief” . At the same time , the language of the statute must not be 
strained to make it apply to a case which d oes not legitimately, on its 
terms, apply by invoking consideration of the supposed intention of 
the legislature. The true meaning of any passage, it is said, is to be 
found not merely in the words of that passage, but in comparing it 
with other parts of t he law, ascertaining also what were the 
circumstances with reference to which the words were used, and what 
was the object appearing from those circumstances which the 
legislature had in view. The same, it would seem, applies to a  by-law. 
Every clause of a  statute should be construed with reference  to the 
context and the other clauses of the Act, so as, so far as possible, to 
make a consisten t enactment of the whole statute or series of statutes 
relating to the subject -matter. Then the office  of all the Judges is 
always  to make  such construction  as shall –   
(a) suppress  the mischief,  and advance  the remedy,  and  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  45 
(b) suppress  subtle  inventions  and evasions  for 
continuance  of the mischief,  and pro privat  
ocommodo  – for private  benefit,  and   
(c) add force and life to the cure and remedy,  according  
to the true intent  of the makers  of the Act, pro bono 
publico  – for the public  good.   
 
In this case, it was debated at large, in what cases the general words 
of Acts of Parliament shall extend to copyhold or customary estates, 
and in what not; and therefore this rule was taken and agreed by the 
whole Court, that when an Act of Parliament does alter the service, 
tenure, interest of the land, or other thing, in prejudice of the lord, or 
of the custom of the manor, or in prejudice o f the tenant, there the 
general words of such Act of Parliament shall not extend to copyholds, 
but when an Act of Parliament is generally made for the good of the 
weal public, and no prejudice can accrue by reason of alteration of any 
interest, service, te nure, or custom of the manor, there many times 
copyhold and customary estates are within the general purview of such 
Acts.”   
 
41.  The learned counsel for the petitioners have vehemently 
contended that many provisions of the impugned Act are designed to 
achieve a particular object and fall within the purview of targeted or 
perceived legislation considering the timing of the re -enactment of the 
contempt law, which was passed at a time when a Prime Minister was 
constrained to leave office in the wake of his conviction for non -
compliance of judgment and orders of this Court and he stood 
disqualified under Article 63(1)(g) as  pointed out in detailed discussion 
on section 3 as well as Article 63(1)(g).  
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  46 
42.  Sheikh Ahsan -un-Din, ASC, President High Court Bar 
Association has strongly objected to the great haste shown by the 
Parliament in the promulgation of COCA 2012. He explained that after 
de-notifying of the former Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani 
from the seat of National Assembly on 19.06.2012, the im pugned law 
was passed in haste. Mr. Liaqat Ali Qureshi, petitioner in person in 
Constitution Petition No. 74 of 2012 by making reference to Quranic  
injunction contended that the impugned law has been promulgated 
without ghor-o-fikr, i.e., due deliberation.   
 
43.  The statement of objects and reasons appended to the 
Contempt of Court Bill, 2012  recited that the contempt law is a blend 
of the power of the court to punish for its contempt and the rights of 
the citizens in a democracy for fair comments and crit icism. It is, 
therefore, necessary that whereas the law may provide to the alleged 
accused to have fair trial including transparent procedure for right to 
appeal. Right to appeal is being streamlined and other necessary 
provisions relevant to contempt proc eedings are being incorporated in 
the Bill. It was vehemently argued on behalf of the petitioners that 
under the repealed Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 the Federation 
had a bitter experience because the then Prime Minister Syed Yousaf 
Raza Gillani was found guilty of, and convicted for, contempt of Court 
under Article 204(2) of the Constitution read with section 3 of the 
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 by a 7 -Member Bench vide 
judgment dated 26.04.2012 passed in Criminal Original Petition No. 06 
of 20 12 in Suo Motu Case No. 04 of 2010 for willful flouting, disregard 
and disobedience of this Court’s direction contained in Para No. 178  of 
the judgment in Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s case . Subsequent thereto,  in Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  47 
pursuance of this Court’s order dated 19.06.2012 p assed in 
Constitution Petitions No. 40 of 2012, etc., instituted under Article 
184(3) of the Constitution, the Election Commission of Pakistan de -
notified him from being a Member of the National Assembly on account 
of conviction/sentence for contempt of Co urt in terms of Article 
63(1)(g) of the Constitution. Consequently, with the Prime Minister 
ceasing to hold office, the whole Cabinet was dissolved and under the 
Constitution a new Member of National Assembly was elected as the 
Leader of the House who ente red upon the office of Prime Minister in 
terms of the Constitution. The judgment of this Court in Dr. Mobashir 
Hassan’s case  had not been implemented by sending a letter to seek 
revival of the requests for mutual legal assistance, the status of civil 
party  claims to the allegedly laundered moneys lying in foreign 
countries including Switzerland. However, while repealing the 
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and adopting the Contempt of 
Court Act, 1976 model, the Parliament did not highlight w hat was the 
mischief and defect  which  the said law did not provide  for, and 
hurriedly  enacted  COCA  2012 without taking into consideration th e 
requirements of mischief rule  because of the apprehension of the 
Federation , as pointed out by the learned counsel for the petiti oners  
and also affirmed by the learned counsel for the respondent himself , 
that the newly elected Prime Minister may not be confronted with the 
situation which Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani had faced . During hearing,  
the learned counsel for the Federation  was asked to explain the 
reasons for which both Houses of Parliament took upon themselves to 
enact the COCA 2012 whereupon  he frankly admitted that COCA 2012 
was promulgated to provide protection to the public office holders by 
incorporating Article 248(1) as a  proviso to section 3 to ensure Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  48 
sustenance of democratic order under the Constitution and that what 
had happened to a former Prime Minister should not happen to another 
Prime Minister. This statement is quite significant in the facts and 
circumstances of t he present case.  We do not want to attribute mala 
fides to the Parliament in promulgating COCA 2012, but any inference 
can be drawn by anyone from the stand taken by the Federation 
through its counsel.    
 
44.  As regards the question of passing of COCA 20 12 in haste , 
in view of the facts noted hereinbefore, no other view is possible 
except to infer that the enactment was got passed by suspending the 
usual business and without referring the matter to any Committee in 
terms of Rule 122 of the Rules of Proced ure of the National Assembly, 
essentially with an apprehension that on the date already fixed by the 
Court in  the implementation proceedings in  Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s 
case, an order might be passed against incumbent Prime Minister. 
While examining the const itutionality of the new enactment, we have 
to keep this factor in our mind as well.   
 
45.  Arguments have been put forward from both the sides in 
support of their respective points of view to persuade the Court on the 
constitutionality or otherwise of COC A 2012. Therefore, following the 
principle that efforts should be made to save the legislation under 
scrutiny  enunciated  in Zahoor Ahmad v. State  (PLD 2007  Lahore 231), 
Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam  (supra ), Wasim Sajjad v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2001  SC 233 ), Zafar Ali Shah v. Pervez Musharraf  (PLD 
2000 SC 869),   Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v. Hart  (1993 SCMR 
1019), Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise and 
Land Customs, Hyderabad  (1990  CLC 456) and Benazir Bhutto v. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  49 
Federation of Pak istan (PLD 1988 SC 416) , we wanted to guide 
ourselves in a proper manner . Accordingly, w e called for the debates 
of the Parliament (National Assembly and Senate) made on the eve of 
promulgation of COCA 2012. A perusal of said debates shows that the 
Bill wa s tabled in the National Assembly on 09.07.2012 by suspending 
rules of procedure of the National Assembly and as per the record of 
the National Assembly, the proceedings were completed the same day. 
After having complied with the codal formalities, it was then tabled 
before the Senate on 11.07.2012 and on completion of the 
proceedings, the President of Pakistan assented to it the same day and 
Act of Parliament was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 
12.07.2012 as Contempt of Court Act, 2012.   
 
46.   It is to be noted that the Judges  of the Superior Courts are 
obliged under the Constitution to discharge their prime responsibility 
of keep ing the fountain of justice unsullied and pure and to ensure that  
nobody is allowed to tarnish the ima ge and the majest y of the Court,  
howsoever high h e may be , or whosoever he may be. [Prem Surana v . 
Additional Munsif and Judicia l (AIR 2002 SC 2956) ]. The g rowing 
tendency of not obeying the judgments of the Courts by the State 
functionaries, including the high -ups of the executive as it happened in  
Criminal Original Petition No. 06 of 2012 in Suo Motu Case No. 04 of 
2010, wherein the then Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani was 
convicted for contempt of c ourt for having failed to comply with the 
orders of this Court , will reduce the judgments/decrees of the Courts 
of law to mere paper decrees and render the whole system of 
administration of justice ineffective and lead to anarchy . Though th e 
courts , exercising judicial restraint , have always used their power  to Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  50 
punish f or contempt sparingly , but  at the same time they have a 
reciprocal expe ctation  from the persons against whom the same were 
issued  for implementation/ execution of the judgments, orders and 
direction s.  
 
47.  It is vehemently contended by Mr. A.K. Dogar, lea rned 
ASC that section 2(a) of COCA 2012 is against the scheme of Article 
204(2) read with Entry 55 of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. 
Section 2(a) defines “judge” as including all officers acting in a judicial 
capacity in the administration of jus tice. On the other hand, Article 
204(1) defines “Court” as the Supreme Court or a High Court. A plain 
reading of the two provisions in juxtaposition makes it clear that the 
Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts having been appointed 
under Articles 17 5A and 193 of the Constitution  are the holders of 
constitutional posts ; therefore, they cannot be equated with the 
judicial officers presiding over courts at the level of the district 
judiciary. Section 2(a) of COCA 2012 gives impression as if it has been 
promulgated for District Courts as mentioned above. The definition of 
“judge” as given in section 2(a) of COCA 2012 is patently 
unconstitutional. The same is, therefore, liable to be struck down on 
the touchstone of the Constitution.  
 
48.  A perusal of Ar ticle 204(2)(b) in juxtaposition with section 
3 of COCA 2012 shows that Article 204 speaks of “any person” 
where as section 3 does not refer to “any person” ; Article 204 speaks 
of “abuses”  the process of Court, which is omitted in Section 3; Article 
204 spe aks of “scandalizes the Court”  which is omitted in section 3; 
and Article 204 uses the phrase “ otherwise does anything which tends 
to bring the Court or a judge of the Court in to hatred, ridicule of Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  51 
Contempt”  whereas the sa id phrase is omitted in section 3 . The words 
“which he is legally bound to obey”  used in section 3 envisage a 
situation where an alleged contemner would be enabled to plead that 
he is not legally bound to obey any partic ular order of the court of law. 
Furthermore, under Article 204, a Cou rt has the power to punish any 
person –  
(i) who abuses the process of the Court in any way,  
(ii) interferes with the process of Court in any way, or  
(iii) obstructs the process of the Court in any way, or  
(iv) disobeys any order of the Court, or  
(v) scandalizes the Court, or   
(vi) does anything which tends to bring the Court or a Judge of 
the Court into hatred, or  
(vii) does anything which tends to bring the Court or a Judge of 
the Court into ridicule, or  
(viii)  does anything which tends to prejudice the determination 
of a matter pending bef ore the Court, or  
(ix) does any other thing which, by law, constitutes contempt 
of Court .  
As against the above, under section 3 of COCA 2012, a Court has the 
power to punish any person who –  
(a) disobeys any order, direction or process of a Court,  
(b) disregards an y order, direction or process of a Court,  
(c) commits a wilful breach of a valid undertaking given to a 
Court,  
(d) tends to bring the authority of a Court or the 
administration of law into disrespect or disrepute,  
(e) interferes with due process of law or due cours e of any 
judicial process,  
(f) obstructs the process of law or the due process of any 
judicial process,  
(g) interrupts process of law or the due process of any judicial 
process,  
(h) lowers the authority of a Court,  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  52 
(i) scandalizes a judge in relation to his office,  
(j) disturbs the order and decorum of the court.  
 
Above analysis of proviso (i) to section 3 in juxtaposition with Article 
204(2) shows that various kinds of contempt of Court enumerated in 
Article 204 , such as noted in aforesaid clauses (i), (vi), (vii) and ( viii) 
have been omitted from the definition given in section 3, thus, the 
power to punish for contempt of Court  has been curtailed in many 
respects powers , which was not within the legislative competence of 
the Parliament on the touchstone of Entry No.55 o f the Federal 
Legislative List (Fourth Schedule to the Constitution) .   
   
49.  It may be noted that in the Contempt of Court Act, 1976 
no exceptio ns were created by the Legislature  to protect a ny public 
office holder from the contempt of Court  proceedings . Under Article 
204 of the Constitution the Supr eme Court and  High Court s have 
power and jurisdiction to punish any person who commits contempt of 
Court as defined in paragraphs (a) to (d) of clause (2) of Article 204 
without any exception. A provision in  the Constitution to punish for the 
contempt of Court attaches great significance in this behalf.  The pari 
materia  provision i n the Constitution of  India , viz.,  Article 215  in 
respect of contempt of court  is not so comprehensive as compared to 
the provisio n of contempt of Court  given in Article 204 of our 
Constitution .   
 
50.  Article  204 empowers Supreme Court and High Courts to 
punish any person for their contempt whereas clause (1) of Article 204 
has defined Court as Supreme Court and a High Court . There fore, by 
applying the literal rule of construction that in absence of any specific 
meaning given to any word or phrase used in a legislative instrument, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  53 
ordinary meanings are to be assigned  to the words and phrases used 
therein . At this ju ncture , reference  to Article 204 (2) is to be made 
wherein the important word s ‘any person’  are used for the purpose of 
awarding punishment . According to Chambers Concise Dictionary 41st 
edition , the word “ any” includes “every” , whereas according to the 
Word and Phrases Volume 32 (page 287), the word ‘person’  means a 
specific kind or manifestation of individual character; a being 
characterized by conscious apprehension, rationality and a moral 
sense; a being possessing or forming the subject of personality; a 
particular indi vidual; one as distinguished emphatically from things or 
animals. Bonbre st v. Kotz, D.C.D.C., 65 F.Supp ., 138, 140) . Thus, 
considering the meaning of the words ‘any person’ as noted  above, 
Article 204 empowers the Supreme Court and a High Court to punish 
all persons across the board without any exception , be he an ordinary 
citizen, any government servant, or the holder of any public office . 
However, the definition of ‘contempt of Court’ given in section 3 of 
COCA 2012 is subject to  proviso , Para (i) whereof  creates exception  in 
respect of public office holders mentioned in Article 248 (1) by 
providing that the exercise of powers and performance of functions by 
them for any act done or purported to be done in exercise of those 
powers and performance of those f unctions shall not amount to 
commission of contempt of Court. As presently we are dealing with the 
exception (i)  under the proviso  to section 3 , therefore, the criteria of 
protection to the President, Governor and Ministers , etc., under Article 
248 has to be kept in mind. For reference clause (1) of Article 248 is 
reproduced herein below:  -  
“248. Protection to President, Governors, Minister, etc. (1) 
The President, a Governor, the Prime Minister, a Federal Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  54 
Minister, a Minister of State, the Chief Minister a nd a 
Provincial Minister shall not be answerable to any court for 
the exercise of those powers and performance of those 
functions:   
Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as 
restricting the right of any person to bring appropriate 
proceedi ngs against the Federation or a Provincial  
Government .”  
 
Though, prima  facie, proviso (i) creates an exception or a defence in 
favour of the public office holders  mentioned in Article 248(1) , but 
virtually such a defence will not remain confined to the pe rsons who 
have been identified in above categories  with reference to persons 
named hereinabove. The language employed in proviso  (i) will provide 
blanket immunity to all public office holders  under this provision. In 
other words , by making reference to Article 248(1) in the ordinary 
legislation , an amendment  has been introduced in Article 204 of the 
Constitution without adhering to the provisions of Article 238 and 239 
of the Constitution , which provide procedure for the amendment of the 
Constitution , i.e. by majority of 2/3rd votes of the total number of 
seats of the House. Regarding legislation by reference it is an accept ed 
principle of jurisprudence  that a provision of the Constitution , which is 
a scared document designed to run the affairs of the countr y and also 
being similar in its nature, cannot be amended  by reference . Inclusion 
of a provision of the Constitution  [Article 248(1)]  as exception (i) to 
section 3 of COCA 2012  has created a mischief purposely, perhaps it 
was in the sub -consci ence of the d raftsman that the fun ctionaries 
mentioned in Article 248 (1) are not answerable to any court in the 
exercise of powers and  performance of functions of their respective 
offices . Clearly, considering the language employed in Article 204, no Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  55 
protection is avai lable to any of the State functionaries mentioned in 
Article 248(1) from contempt proceedings , which are sui generis  for 
any act done or purported to be done by them in exercise of powers 
and functions unless an amendment is made in the former Article of 
the Constitution. This aspect was considered by this Court in Zahur 
Ilahi v. Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto  (PLD 1975 SC 383)  and it was held  that 
the powers and functions of the Prime Minister are derived from the 
Constitution , therefore, the same must be referab le to the 
Constitution. Since neither the Constitution nor any law can possibly 
authorize the Prime Minister to commit a criminal act or do anything 
which is contrary to law, the immunity cannot extend to illegal or 
unconstitutional acts. It was further he ld that e ven a Prime Minister is , 
under clause (2) of Article 5 of the Constitution , bound to obey the 
Constitution and law as that is the basic obligation of every citizen. It 
was observed that t he scope of the powers and functions of a Prime 
Minister can not possibly extend to the committing of contempt of 
Court  which is punishable under the Constitution itself and, therefore, 
by necessary implication prohibited. It was held that if the speech of 
the Prime Minister did prejudice the pending proceedings aga inst the 
National Awami party and also contained a veiled threat to the Court, 
then it amounted to contempt and was not protected by Article 248. It 
was noted that t he Constitution itself declares by Article 190 that all 
executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan shall act in aid 
of the Supreme Court. The Prime Minister is, therefore, duty -bound to 
give effect to the decisions of this Court . Considering the exposition of 
law made in the precedent case, this much is abundantly clear that  
such a p rotection cannot be extended  by means of an ordinary 
legislation  as is attempted to be done by means of Para (i) to proviso Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  56 
to section 3 of COCA 2012 . Reference at this stage may be made to 
the case of Muhammad Azam Khan v. Government of N.W.F.P.  (1998 
SCMR 204) wherein, while dealing with the power of Chief Justice of 
Peshawar High Court to make recommendation for regularization of 
the appointees in terms of North -West Frontier Province Public Service 
Commission Ordinance, 1978 , it was held that the concep t of 
independence of judiciary  would not make judiciary above the law. 
Obedience to law and strict adherence thereto by judiciary would 
rather ensure its independence and enhance its prestige. Therefore, 
only such recommendation would be meaningful and eff ective which 
was made in accordance with law and not which was violative of law or 
which would have effect of frustrating the law. On the same analogy, 
adherence to the Constitution  by all the State functionaries, low or 
high, including the Chief Executive  of the country would enhance their 
prestige and honour in the eyes of the general public.  It is also in the 
interest of good governance and welfare of the citizens, which is the 
raison d'être of existence of any State.   
 
51.   It also appears that b y crea ting a group of special people 
(public office holders ) a serious threat ha s been posed  to the 
independence of  judiciary , which is required to be fully secured under 
Article 2A . In view of the language employed in Para (i) to proviso to 
section 3 , the trust  of the citizens has been betrayed , inasmuch as  in 
future the words ‘any person’ used in Article 204(2) would  not include 
the persons referred to in Para (i) to proviso to section 3 and not liable 
to be punished for the contempt of Court. Similarly, amongs t equals 
i.e. who have committed contempt of court no classification is 
permissible between public office holders and others falling within the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  57 
definition of ‘any person’. It would be appropriate to note that all 
constitutional functionaries are bound to f ollow the orders of the Court 
because under Article 248(1) no such exception is available to them. 
Thus, the defence/exception envisaged by proviso (i) to section 3 has 
created unreasonable classification , which is  prohibited under Article 
25 of the Consti tution , besides being violative of  the due process of 
law within the contemplation of Article 4 of the Constitution .  
 
52.  Here, reference may also be made to the case of Benazir 
Bhutto v. President of Pakistan  (PLD 1998 SC 388) wherein was held 
that by providing that independence of judiciary  shall be fully secured 
and all existing laws should be brought in conformity with the 
Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah  the 
provisions of Articles 2, 2A & 227 of the Constitution have gi ven 
Islamic character to the Constitution. It may be mentioned that 
according to Injunctions of Islam , there is no distinction between the 
high and the low in the application of law . The Holy Prophet (PBUH) in 
his last sermon ( Khutba Hajji tul wida ) said, “all mankind is from Adam 
and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non -Arab nor a non -Arab 
has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over 
black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and 
good action. Know that every Muslim is a brother to every other 
Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall 
be lawful to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was 
given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to 
yourselves .”  
 
53.  Article 63 of the Constitution lays down disqualifications for 
membership of Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament). Clause (1)(g) of the said Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  58 
Article provides that a person shall be disqualified from being elected 
or chosen as, and from being, a member of th e Majlis -e-Shoora  
(Parliament), if he has been convicted by a court of competent 
jurisdiction for propagating any opinion, or acting in any manner, 
prejudicial to , inter alia, the integrity or independence of the judiciary 
of Pakistan, or which defames or brings into ridicule the judiciary, 
unless a period of five years has elapsed since his release. However, 
section 3 in defining contempt of Court, inter alia, as doing anything to 
scandalize  a judge in relation to his office uses the word ‘judge’ 
instead of Court (institution of judiciary). The use of the words ‘judge 
in relation to his office’ instead of ‘Court’ is clearly against the scheme 
of Article 63(1)(g), which talks of judiciary, and not of any ‘judge’. 
Therefore, the provisions of section 3 are a lso violative of the said 
Article.  
 
54.  Mr. A.K. Dogar has argued that section 4(4) of the Act is 
subject to subsection (1) which is also subject to subsection (2) which 
pertains to apology, therefore, it is a case of vague law, and vague law 
is no law . And, if the reason of the law ceases, the law ceases. 
Barrister Zafarullah Khan, Advocate has argued that section 4(4) is 
also violative of Articles 189 and 190. Mr. Rashid A. Rizvi has argued 
that a n Act of Parliament, which is intended to nullify or frus trate the 
judgments of the Supreme Court, violates the principle of trichotomy 
of powers and is, therefore, void. He has argued that the Parliament 
cannot encroach upon the domain of judiciary to interpret any law or 
to nullify any rule laid down by the Su preme Court, which has attained 
finality in view of Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution. To persuade 
the Court to take the above view, he has placed reliance on Indian Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  59 
Aluminum Co. v. State of Kerala & Others  [(1996) 7 SCC 637)] (Paras 
35 to 56 at pag es 653 to 663) and Mehram Ali ’s case  (supra ) Para 4 at 
page 1466. He has also argued that by limiting the offence of 
contempt under section 4 of the Act, 2012  the power of judicial review 
of the Superior Courts as provided in Article 184(3) and 199 of the 
Constitution has been made ineffective. He has pointed out that the 
rule/ratio of the following cases, amongst others, is likely to be 
nullified: -  
(i) Karachi Bar Association v. Abdul Hafeez Pirzada (PLD 1988 
Karachi 309)  
(ii) Ch. Zahur Ellahi v. Zulfiqar Ali Bh utto (PLD 1975 SC 383)  
(iii) Amanullah Khan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1990 SC 
1092)  
(iv) Syed Masroor Ahsan v. Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1998 SC 
823)  
(v) Dr. Mobashir Hassan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2010 
SC 265).   
 
On the other hand, Mr. Abdul Shakoor Paracha , ASC for the Federation 
has argued that there was no ambiguity in the law, therefore, there 
was no necessity to make reference to the assembly debates or other 
material , inasmuch as  the intention of the legislature  was manifestly 
clear. He has placed reli ance on PLD 1997 SC 11. He has also argued 
that it is a well established rule of interpretation that a legislative 
instrument is to be read as a whole and that all institutions have to 
adopt the principle of harmonious interpretation. He has further 
argued  that subsection (4) of section 4 is not violative of any provision 
of the Constitution. He has argued that the judgment passed in one 
case cannot be made basis for proceeding for contempt in another 
case. He has urged that after conviction of former Prime  Minister, the 
proceedings cannot continue. The learned Attorney General has also 
argued that the provisions of the COCA 2012 cannot be termed 
unambiguous in any manner, and it is for the Courts of law to give Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  60 
effect to the same by recourse to the principl es of interpretation of 
statutes, however, in the instant case, nobody has made any attempt 
to have recourse to such principles of interpretation.  
 
55.  A perusal of s ubsection (4) of s ection 4 of COCA 2012 
shows that it has introduced a non obstante  clause, inasmuch as it 
provide s that notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, no 
Court shall have the power to pass any order of punishment for, or in 
relation to any act of contempt, save and except in accordance with 
subsection (1) of section 4. This provision essentially lays down that 
the judgments passed earlier will be ignored and the order of 
punishment for contempt of Court  will only be passed in accordance 
with subsection (1) of section 4 . The issue whether the legislature by 
means of an ena ctment can undo the effect of the judgment has 
engaged the attention of the superior courts in a large number of 
cases. It is well settled by the time that no legislation on any subject is 
permissible , which is against any specific provision of the Constit ution. 
As far as nullifying the effect of a judgment by means of legislation is 
concerned, there are certain limitations including the one i.e. by 
amending the law with retrospective effect, on the basis of which the 
order or judgment has been passed  and thereby removing the basis of 
the decision.  Reference may be made to the cases of Dr. Mobashir 
Hassan , Tofazzal Hossain v. Province of East Pakistan  (PLD 1963 SC 
251), Tirath Ram Rajindra Nath v. State of U.P.  (AIR 1973 SC405), 
Mamukanjan Cotton Factory v. Punjab Province  (PLD 1975 SC 
50) and Misrilal Jain v. State of Orissa  (AIR 1977 SC 1686). 
Further, as held  in the case of I.N. Saksena v. State  of Madhya 
Pradesh  (AIR 1976 SC 2250), it is also to be seen  whether the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  61 
legislature possesses competence over th e subject matter ; whether by 
validation the legislature has removed the defect which the courts had 
found in the previous law ; and w hether it is consistent with the 
provisions of Part III of th e Constitution. In Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s case  
extract from Thom as M. Cooley ’s Treaties on the Constitutional 
Limitation was quoted with approval . To understand the issue in hand, 
it may be advantageous to reproduce the same. It  reads as under: -  
“If the legislature would prescribe a different rule for the 
future from  that which the courts enforce, it must be done 
by statute, and cannot be done by a mandate to the 
courts, which leaves the law unchanged, but seeks to 
compel the courts to construe and apply it not according to 
the judicial, but according to the legislati ve judgment. But 
in any case the substance of the legislative action should 
be regarded rather than the form; and if it appears to be 
the intention to establish by declaratory statute a rule of 
conduct for the future, the courts should accept and act 
upon it, without too nicely inquiring whether the mode by 
which the new rule is established is the best, most 
decorous and suitable that could have been adopted or 
not. If the legislature cannot thus indirectly control the 
action of the courts, by requiring of them a construction of 
the law according to its own views, it is very plain it cannot 
do so directly, by setting aside their judgments, compelling 
them to grant new trials, ordering the discharge of 
offenders, or directing what particular steps shall be ta ken 
in the progress of a judicial inquiry.”   
 
In Al-Samrez Enterprise  v. Federation of Pakistan  (1986 SCMR 1917) , 
it was held that t he principle of law  stated in  Maxwell ’s Interpretation 
of Statutes, 1962 Edition , p. 206 that e very statute, it has been sa id, 
which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing 
laws, or creates a new obligation, or imposes a new duty, or attaches Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  62 
a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already 
past, must be presumed, out of respect to the legislature, to be 
intended not to  have a retrospective operation, is recognized  in Corpus  
Juris of this country by its incorporation in section 6 of the General 
Clauses Act. After making reference to the cases of March , Mander v. 
Harris  [(1884) 27 Ch. D. 166] and Jones v. Ogle  [(1872) L.R. 8 Ch. A. 
192], it was further held that if a binding contract was concluded 
between the appellants and the foreign exporter or steps were taken 
by the appellants creating a vested right to the then existing 
notification granting exemption, the same could not be taken away 
and destroyed in modification of the earlier one, on the ground that 
under section 21 of the General Clauses Act, the Government could 
exercise the power of modification. In Haji Ghulam Rasul v. 
Governme nt of The Punjab through Secretary, Auqaf  (2003 SCMR 
1815) , it was found that s pecific provisions ha d been made to nullify 
the judgment of th e Supreme Court . It was observed that the 
Legislature is competent to enact law nullifying the judgment of the 
Court. In Mamukanjan Cotton Factory v. The Punjab Province  (PLD 
1975 SC 50 ), however, the argument that the judgments are rendered 
by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction conferred by the 
Constitution itself , but t he validating Ordinance being a  is s ub-
constitutional  legislation cannot undo or destroy the ‘end product’ of 
the constitutional jurisdiction was not accepted and it was held that 
the argument is without substance and one which if accepted could 
indeed lead to startling results . It would str ike at the very root of the 
power of Legislature, otherwise competent to legislate on a particular 
subject, to undertake any remedial or curative legislation after 
discovery of defect in an existing law as a result of the judgment of a Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  63 
Superior Court passe d in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction. It 
was further observed that t he argument overlook ed the fact  that the 
remedial or curative legislation is also ‘the end product’  of 
Constitutional jurisdiction in the cognate field. It was held that t he 
argument if accepted, would also seek to throw into serious disarray 
the pivotal arrangement in the Constitution regarding the division of 
sovereign power of the State among its principal organs, namely, the 
Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, each  being the master of 
the field assigned to it under the Constitution.  In Fecto Belarus Tractor 
Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan  (PLD 2005 SC 605 ), after detailed 
analysis of the case law on the issue, it was held that power of the 
legislature to remove the b asis on which the judgment is founded is 
not disputed and that unless  the basis for judgment in favour of a 
party is removed, it would not affect the rights of a party in whose 
favour the same was passed.   
 
56.  It is established that on the one hand, by limiting the 
power to punish for the offence of contempt of Court  in terms of 
section 4, the powers of judicial review of the superior courts as 
provided in Articles 184(3) and 199 of the  Constitution have been 
made in effective , and on the other  hand,  the Fundamental Right  of 
access to justice of the citizens would be frustrated if the judgment 
passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction cannot be implemented . 
The right of access to courts and justice has been dilated upon  in a 
large number of cases.  In the case of Sharaf Faridi v. Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan  (PLD 1989 Karachi 404) after referring to the cases of Syed 
Abul A'la Maudoodi v. Government of West Pakistan  (PLD 1964 SC 
673) and Ms. Benazir Bhutto  v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 198 8 SC Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  64 
416) it ha s been  held that t he right of access to justice to all is a well  
recognized  inviolable right enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution. 
This right is eq ually found in the doctrine of “ due process of law ”. The 
right of access to justice includes the right to be treated according to 
law, the right to have a fair and proper trial and a right to have an 
impartial Court or Tribunal. In the case of Government of Balochistan 
v. Azizullah Memon  (PLD 1993 SC 341) , it has been held that 
provisions under scrutiny den y the right  of access to Courts and 
justice. This by itself is an infringement of Fundamental Rights which 
provide that every citizen shall be entitled to equal protection of law 
and will not be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law. 
An examination of Articles 9 and 25 read collectively does not permit 
the Legislature to frame a law, which may bar right of access to the 
Courts of law and justice. The right of access to justice is 
internationally well recognized human right and is now  being  
implemented and executed by granting relief under the Constitutional 
provisions. In the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 
1996 SC 324) it has been held that the right to have access to justice 
through an independent Judiciary is a Fund amental Right as held in the 
case of Sharaf Faridi  (supra). In Liaqat Hussain ’s case  (supra ) the 
Court relying upon the cases of Azizullah Memon  and Al-Jehad Trust  
held that the right to have access to justice through the forums as 
envisaged by the Constit ution is a Fundamental Right. In Mehram Ali ’s 
case (supra ) a Full Bench of this Court while examining the vires of the 
various provisions of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 has held that the 
right of “access to justice to all” is a fundamental right, which ri ght 
cannot be exercised in the absence of an independent Judiciary 
providing impartial, fair and just adjudicatory framework i.e. judicial Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  65 
hierarchy. The Courts/Tribunals which are manned and run by 
Executive Authorities without being under the control and  supervision 
of the High Court in terms of Article 203 of the Constitution can hardly 
meet the mandatory requirement of the Constitution.  The same 
principle has been highlighted in the cases of Al-Jehad Trust v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (1999 SCMR 1379) , Khan Asfandyar Wali v.  
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2001 SC 607), Rauf B. Kadri  v. State Bank 
of Pakistan  (PLD 2002 SC 1111), In the matter of: Reference No.2 of 
2005 by the President of Pakistan  (PLD 2005 SC 873), Muhammad 
Nadeem Arif  v. Inspector -General of  Police,  Punjab  (2011 SCMR 408), 
Shahid Orakazi  v. Pakistan through Secretary Law  (PLD 2011 SC 365), 
All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation of Pakistan  (supra ) and 
Watan Party v.  Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2012 SC 292).  
 
57.  Under the constitutio nal scheme, the constitutionality of 
legislation is examined by the Superior Courts in exercise of power of 
judicial review. Judicial review is a manifestation of the principle of 
trichotomy of powers, which envisages that the three organs of the 
State, na mely, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary work 
within their respective domains in a system of checks and balances. 
The doctrine of judicial review postulates that the legislative and 
executive actions are subject to scrutiny by the superior co urts to 
determine their compatibility or otherwise with the terms of a written 
Constitution. The idea that courts could nullify statutes originated in 
England with Chief Justice Edward Coke’s opinion given in the year 
1610 in Dr. Bonham’s Case  [8 Co. Rep. 107a]. Under a statute of 
Parliament, the London College of Physicians was enabled to levy fines 
against anyone who violated their rules. The College accused a doctor Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  66 
of practicing without a license and fined him accordingly. Coke J. found 
that the statuto ry powers of the College violated “common right or 
reason” because “no person should be a judge in his own cause”. T he 
idea that Courts could declare statutes void was defeated in England 
with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when King James II was 
removed  and the elected Parliament declared itself supreme. However, 
with the passage of time, the concept of supremacy of Parliament has 
undergone change even in England  as noted by one of us, Mr. Justice 
Jawwad S. Khawaja in a recent case titled as Muhammad Azh ar 
Siddique v. Federation of Pakistan  (Constitution Petition No. 40 of 
2012) decided on 19.06.2012 wherein he has observed that in Jackson 
v. Her Majesty’s Attorney General  [(2005) UKHL 560], Lord Steyn 
writing in the House of Lords, the highest Court of E ngland, has held 
that the classic account given by Dicey of the doctrine of supremacy of 
Parliament, pure and absolute as it was, can now be seen to be out of 
place in the modern United Kingdom.   
 
58.  The United States Supreme Court for the first time, i n the 
case of Calder v. Bull  [3 U.S. 386 (1798)], exercised power to review 
state legislature decisions. In that case, the Connecticut legislature 
ordered a new trial in a court case about the contents of a will, 
overruling an earlier court decision challe nged before the Court. The 
US Supreme Court, vide unanimous decision, held that the actions of 
the legislature did not violate the ex post facto law in Article 1, section 
10 of the Constitution. Justice James Iredell, in his opinion, though 
stated that cou rts cannot strike down statutes based only upon 
principles of natural justice, but affirmed the ability of the Supreme 
Court to review legislative acts, based on something more than Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  67 
principles of natural justice. Relevant portion of the judgment is 
reprodu ced hereinbelow: -  
If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, 
violates those constitutional provisions, it is 
unquestionably void ... If, on the other hand, the 
Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member 
of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of 
their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it 
to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, 
contrary to the principles of natural justice …  
There are then but two lights, in which the subject can be 
viewed:  
1st.  If the Legislature pursue the authority 
delegated to them, their acts are valid … they 
exercise the discretion vested in them by the people, 
to whom alone they are responsible for the faithful 
discharge of their trust ...  
2nd. If they tr ansgress the boundaries of that 
authority, their acts are invalid ... they violate a 
fundamental law, which must be our guide, 
whenever we are called upon as judges to determine 
the validity of a legislative act.  
 
59.  Five years later, the US Supreme Cour t for the first time 
declared a legislative action as “unconstitutional”  in the landmark case 
of Murbury v. Madison  [5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)], which formed 
the basis for the exercise of judicial review in the United States under 
Article III of the Am erican Constitution. In the said case, William 
Marbury was appointed by President John Adams as Justice of the 
Peace in the District of Columbia, but commission was not 
subsequently delivered to him, as such, he filed a petition before the 
Supreme Court of  America. It was prayed that Secretary of State 
James Madison be forced to deliver the document, but the court, with 
John Marshall as Chief Justice, declined Marbury’s petition, holding Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  68 
that the part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 upon which he had based his  
claim was unconstitutional.   
 
60.  The next major ruling whereby an Act of Congress was 
struck down by the US Supreme Court was the case of Dred Scott v . 
Sandford  [60 U.S. 393 ( 1857)], wherein the already repealed Missouri 
Compromise of 1820 was invalida ted. Later, in the case of Hepburn v . 
Griswold  [75 U.S. 603 ( 1870)] it was held that Congress could not 
make paper money legal tender for the payment of certain debts. In 
the year 1895 the federal income tax was invalidated. Over half a 
century between Marbury and the Dred Scott decision, the Court 
reviewed and upheld several federal statutes. However, each time, it 
reinforced the power it had claimed in Marbury  and each time the 
Government conceded the Court’s power of judicial review. In the case 
of Hamme r v. Dagenhart  [247 U.S. 251 (1918)],  the Court said 
Congress did not design the Child Labor Act of 1916 as a regulation of 
interstate commerce but to discourage the use of child labor, an 
impermissible objective. In the case of Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. 
[259 U.S. 20 (1922)], an attempt to tax goods manufactured by 
children was struck down on identical reasoning that the tax was not 
intended to raise revenue, but to penalize employers of children. In 
the case of Carter v. Carter Coal Co.  [298 U.S. 238 (1936)] while 
invalidating New Deal legislation regulating coal production, it was held 
that if the rest of a statute can stand on its own when part of it has 
been invalidated, the Court will strike down only the unconstitutional 
portion. In the case of Baker v. Carr  [369 U.S. 186  (1962)], it was 
held that federal courts could review state apportionment plans for 
violations of federally guaranteed rights.  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  69 
 
61.  The Supreme Court of India, in the case of Kesavananda 
Bahrain v.  The State of Kerala  (AIR 1973 SC 1461) while exercising 
the power of judicial review to consider the validity of the Twenty -
fourth, Twenty -fifth and Twenty -ninth Amendments of the Constitution 
held that the basic structure of the Constitution was outside the 
competence of the amendator y power of Parliament. In the case of 
Smt. Indira Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain  (AIR 1975 SC 2299) while 
considering the constitutionality of Thirty -ninth Amendment of the 
Constitution it was held that by upsetting that fine balance between 
the three organs, d estroy the fundamental premises of a democratic 
Government to which were pledged. In the case of Minerva Mills Ltd v. 
Union of India  (AIR 1980 SC 1789) while considering the 
constitutionality of Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution it was 
held that t he judiciary was the interpreter of the Constitution and was 
assigned the delicate task of determining the extent of the power 
conferred on each branch of the government, its limits and whether 
any action of that branch transgressed such limits. In the cas e of A.K. 
Kaul v. Union of India  (AIR 1995 SC 1403), the court discussed the 
justiciability of an action of an authority functioning under the Indian 
Constitution. In the case of Raja Ram Pal v. Speaker, Lok Sabha  
[(2007) 3 SCC 184] it was held that it was  the solemn duty of the 
Court to protect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution 
zealously and vigilantly. In the case of I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil 
Nadu (AIR 2007 SC 861), while considering the validity of 
amendments to the Constitution m ade on or after 24th April, 1973, 
after referring to the cases of L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India  
[(1997) 3 SCC 261] and S.R. Bommai v. Union of India  [(1994) 3 SCC Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  70 
1], it was held that the judicial review was a basic feature of the 
Constitution and suc h constituent power could not be abrogated by 
judicial process of interpretation. It was further held that it was a 
cardinal principle of the Constitution that no one could claim to be the 
sole judge of the power given under the Constitution and that its 
actions were within the confines of the powers given by the 
Constitution.  
 
62.   A perusal of subsection (4) of section 4 reveals that it is 
enacted to undo the effect of the judgments passed by the courts of 
law, which are binding on all other courts in P akistan to the extent 
they decide a question of law, or are based upon or enunciate a 
principle of law  as provided in Article 189 of the Constitution . Thus, 
apart from being contrary to Article 189 of the Constitution , it is  held 
to be violative of the Fun damental Right of access to justice enshrined 
in Article 9 of the Constitution and void as per Article 8  of the 
Constitution .   
 
63.  It was vehemently contended on behalf of the petitioners 
that the impugned law is violative of the principle of independen ce of 
judiciary and access to justice  as enshrined in Article s 2A, 4, 5, 9, 14, 
19, 37(d), 175, 189, 190,  191, 204 and 227 of the Constitution.  
Reliance has been placed on the cases of  Mehram Ali v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (supra) , Liaquat Hussain v. Federa tion of Pakistan  (PLD 1999 
SC 504) , In the matter of : Reference No.2 of 2005 by the President  
(PLD 2005 SC 873 ), Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2009 SC 879) , Mehram Ali v. Federation of Pakistan  
(1998 SCMR  1156)  and Mir Muh ammad Idris v. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Ministry of Finance  (PLD 2011 SC 213) .  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  71 
 
64.  In the case of Chairman, N.W.F.P. Forest Development 
Corporation v.  Khurshid Anwar Khan  (1992 SCMR 1202) , it was held 
that Court acting under rules framed  by virtue of the Constitutional 
power was not bound to follow any other statutory dispensation , which 
came in conflict with the independence of judiciary. Supreme Court 
was not even bound by the provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 or 
Criminal Procedu re Code, 1898 in so far as regulation and control of 
practice and procedure of the Court itself was concerned. It was 
further held that Article 2A of the Constitution (Objectives Resolution) 
command s that independence of judiciary  has to be fully secured. 
Words ‘fully’ and ‘secured’ are explicit enough not to leave any doubt 
that Constitutional set up of Pakistan preserves the independence of 
Supreme Court by a definite mandate.  Considering the importance 
assigned to the independence of judiciary  under the Constitution , this 
Court, i n the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 
1996 SC 324) held that in case of conflict between the two  Articles 209 
and 203C , Article 209 of the Constitution shall prevail over Art icle 
203C which detracts from dom inant intent and spirit of the 
Constitution , namely , independence of judiciary . In the case of 
Mahmood Khan Achakzai v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1997 SC 426) 
it was held that limitation placed on the power of judicial review of 
superior Courts or any Co urt through Constitution (Eighth 
Amendment) Act, 1985 was without any legal basis. Power and 
jurisdiction of judicial review could not be controlled and fettered on 
such basis. Judges of the Superior Courts had taken oath to defend, 
preserve and protect th e Constitution. It was further held that Courts 
while striking down any illegal and unconstitutional provision or Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  72 
interpreting the Constitution are bound to defend, protect and 
preserve the Constitution. Salary paid to the Judges was not a bounty 
or favour , rather it was a constitutional duty to pay salary and give 
other benefits to the Judges by which independence of judiciary  was 
guaranteed.  In the case of Mehram Ali v. Federation of Pakistan  (1998 
SCMR  1156) certain provisions of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 were 
declared to be not valid as the same militated against the concept of 
independence of judiciary  and Articles 175 & 203 of the Constitution.  
In the case of Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1998 SC 161) it 
was held th at right of access to im partial  and independent 
Courts/Tribunals is a fundamental right of every citizen. The existence 
of this right is de pendent on the independence of judiciary. It was 
further held that any deviation from the method of appointment 
prescribed under the Constitu tion to the high Office of Chief Justice of 
Pakistan is likely to shake the public confidence in the institution of 
judiciary and to tarnish its image as the neutral arbiter in dispute 
between citizen and citizen and citizen and State, thus, infringing the  
Fundamental Rights of citizens guaranteed under Articles 9 and 25 of 
the Constitution to have free, fair and equal access to independent 
Courts/Tribunals.  In the case of Masroor Ahsan ’s case  (supra ) it was 
held that the Constitution has enshrined and emph asized  
independence of judiciary  and relevant provisions of the Constitution 
have to be interpreted in a manner which would ensure independence 
of judiciary  and  that neither the Judiciary nor the Legislature 
transgress  their  limits and an equilibrium is ma intained inter se among 
the three organs of the State.  In the case of Sajjad Ali Shah v. Asad 
Ali (1999 SCMR 640) it was held that the a ppointment of senior most 
Judge of Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of Pakistan was not only Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  73 
supported by a well -estab lished Constitutional convention acted upon 
and accepted by the functionaries exercising power to appoint the 
Chief Justice of Pakistan, but also on a fair interpretation of provisions 
of Articles of the Constitution relating to the appointment of Chief 
Justice of Pakistan and th e principle of independence of judiciary  
enshrined in the Constitution. In the case of Jamat -i-Islami Pakistan v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2000 SC 111) it was held that the 
provision of section 35 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 was not valid 
as the same militated against the concept of the independence of 
judiciary  and was also violative of Articles 175 & 203 of the 
Constitution, and therefore, needed to be suitably amended inasmuch 
as the power to frame rules was to be vested in  the High Court to be 
notified by the Government. In the case of Ziaullah v. Najeebullah  
(PLD 2003 SC 656) it was held that the q uestion relating to the age of 
a claimant in terms of section 7 of Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 
2000 can only be determin ed by a judicial forum for it is a question of 
fact which can be settled judiciously for the purpose of treating the 
accused to be a juvenile offender. The Executive Authorities or any 
Committee enjoy s no powers to discharge the judicial functions and if 
they are allowed to do so, that would negate the independence of 
judiciary  as any Court or Tribunal which is not found on any of the 
Articles of the Constitution cannot lawfully share judicial powers with 
the Courts referred to in Articles 175 & 203 of the Constitution. In the 
case of Accountant -General, Sindh v. Ahmed Ali U. Qureshi  (PLD 2008 
SC 522) it was held that in a broader sense, the concept of 
independence of judiciary  is not confined to the extent of disposal of 
cases by the Judges and discharging of judicial functions rather in the 
extended meanings, the concept of independence of judiciary  is Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  74 
complete separation from executive authorities of the State in all 
matters including pay and pension which is an essential component of 
independence of judic iary. It was further held that all financial matters 
concerning the judiciary including pay and pension as well as other 
privileges of Judges are under the direct control of Executive 
Authorities and Executive Authorities, treating the judiciary as a 
subor dinate department, without recognizing its independent status as 
an important organ of the State . It was held that t he executive is not 
supposed to interfere in the affairs of judiciary in any manner. In the 
case of Shamshad v. Federal Board of Intermediat e and Secondary 
Education  (PLD 2009 SC 75) it was held that the Supreme Court did 
not claim supremacy but at the same time it was its constitutional duty 
to uphold the independence of judiciary  and rule of law. Legislature, 
executive and judiciary were enj oined by the Constitution to perform 
their functions and discharge their duties within the limits set by the 
Constitution and the law. Existence and extent of a privilege of a 
House or its Committee that it had certain privilege was not conclusive 
and the same had to be established before the court of law. Once the 
same was established, the courts were required to stay their hand s off 
ungrudgingly. Proceedings  by a court or the Parliament or its 
Committee  were not to be taken in a manner which may lead to 
unnecessary confrontation and chaos. Provisions of R ule 201(5) of the 
Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 
had been wisely introduced with a view to avoid any conflict with , or 
encroachment upon , the exercise of judicial power  which could not be 
taken away or abridged in any manner.  In the case of Sindh High 
Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2009 SC 879) it 
was held that access to justice and independence of judiciary  is a Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  75 
salient feature of Constitution of P akistan . The Chief Justice of Pakistan 
is head of the Judiciary, therefore , his views deserve due deference 
and his recommendation  is non -justiciable which  is inextricably linked 
with the independence of judiciary. In the case of Chief Justice of 
Pakistan v. President of Pakistan  (PLD 2010 SC 61) while considering 
the validity of the order of the President of Pakistan r estraining a 
Judge from exercising his judicial power and from discharging the 
obligations cast on him by the Constitution, it was held that  the order 
in question of the President was an order passed without jurisdiction; 
was offensive of the constitutional provisions guaranteeing security of 
office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, its tenure and of the 
independence of judiciary  and was thus ultra vires of the Constitution.  
In Dr. Mobashir Hassan ’s case , it was held that n o other forum 
including the Legislature is empowered to declare an order or 
judgment, whereby conviction has been recorded under section 31 -A 
of the National Accountability O rdinance, 1999 to be void ab initio  
except in the civil cases pertaining to certain tax matters  and any 
intervention by the executive, contrary to the principle of 
Independence of Judiciary , is unconstitutional.  
 
65.   Article 2A of the Constitution provi des that independence 
of the judiciary shall be fully secured primarily to ensure that the 
Superior Courts play their due role in the enforcement of the 
Fundamental Rights of the citizens guaranteed under the Constitution. 
A host of other provisions incorp orated in the Constitution point to the 
scheme and significance of the role to be played by this important 
organ of the State. Article 8 of the Constitution provides that if any law 
is found to be inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights provided in Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  76 
Chapte r 1, Part II of the Constitution, such a law, to the extent of 
inconsistency shall be void. The Superior Courts, in the past, in 
exercise of the powers of judicial review as has been discussed 
hereinabove, have been examining and declaring the laws void, 
meaning thereby that such laws are rendered inoperative 
constitutionally. Thus, it is concluded that the Superior Courts, while 
exercising the power of judicial review are possessed with the 
jurisdiction to declare a law void to the extent of inconsistency with 
the Fundamental Rights, the principle of Independence of Judiciary or 
any other provision of the Constitution .  
66.  Subsection (2) of section 6 of COCA 2012 provides that no 
court shall take cognizance as of a contempt of Court  of any averment 
made b efore the Supreme Judicial Council in respect of which the 
Supreme Judicial Council has given a finding that the averment fulfilled 
the requirements of clause (vi) of the proviso to section. Since th is 
provision is dependent upon, and relatable to, section  3, which has 
been declared to be ultra vires, therefore, the foundation upon which it 
rested having been removed, it cannot stand. Accordingly, it ceases to 
exist.  
67.  Subsection (3) of section 6 provides that no court shall 
take cognizance of contempt of Court arising from an averment made 
in due course in appellate, revisional or revi ew proceedings, till such 
proceedings have been finalized and no further appeal, revision or 
review lies. This provision gives a licence to commit contempt of Court 
unhind ered by the penal action by the Court, inasmuch as it postpones 
the cognizance of a contempt case for an indefinite period of time and  
altogether ignores the fact that in a large number of cases, the alleged 
contemner may be required to be punished promptl y to maintain the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  77 
dignity and respect of the court, particularly where the contempt is 
committed in the face of the Judge . In Khalid Masood’s case  (supra ), 
the importance of the power to punish for contempt of Court as 
emphasized in Sir Edward Snelson’s ca se (PLD 19961 SC 237) was 
taken note of wherein it was held that the power of committal for 
contempt is given to the Superior Courts in order that they may swiftly 
and summarily protect themselves against willful disregard or 
disobedience of their authorit y by visiting with prompt punishment any 
conduct, which tends to bring their authority and the administration of 
justice into scorn or disregard. It was further held that the dignity an d 
authority of the courts has a link with the supremacy and majesty of 
the law, therefore, any conduct which is calculated to diminish that 
dignity or authority is a criminal contempt, which a Court is under duty 
to punish. In State v. M ujibur Rahman Shami  (PLD 1973 SC 1), it was 
observed that contempt of Court is a grave off ence against the State.  
68.  As rightly argued by Mr. Zafarullah Khan, a Magistrate 
Class-III is empowered under section 228 PPC to punish a person in 
such like cases. Similarly, many other authorities are empowered 
under the Constitution and the law to p unish persons who undermine 
their authority. In such circumstances, there is no reason as to why a 
Judge be not empowered to punish a person who may be  eroding or 
undermining his authority. Reference has been made to Lord 
Denning ’s book “The Due Process of  Law”. The learned author, in the 
introduction to the book, quoted  Lord Hardwicke who said in [The St. 
James ’ Evening Post case  (1742) 2 Atkins 469 at p. 472]  that t here 
cannot be anything of greater consequence than to keep the streams 
of justice clear an d pure, that parties may proceed with safety both to 
themselves and their characters.  There is not one stream of justice. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  78 
There are many streams. Whatever obstructs their courses or muddies 
the waters of any of those streams is punish able under the single 
cognomen “ Contempt of Court ”. It has its peculiar features. It is a 
criminal offence but it is not  tried on indictment with a jury. It is tried 
summarily by a judge alone, who may be  the very judge who has been 
injured by the contempt.  He further referred to Francis Mann, who 
wrote in July 1979 issue of The Law Quarterly Review  (p. 348)  that 
contempt of Court  is undoubtedly one of the great contributions the 
common law has made to the civilized behaviour of a large part of the 
world beyond the continent of Europe where the institution is 
unknown. In his treatise, Lord Denning also referred to the case titled 
R v. Almon [(1765) Wilm 243 – 271] that if the authority of the Judges 
is to be trampled upon by pamphleteers and news writers, and the 
people are to be  told that the power given to the Judges for their 
protection is prostituted to their destruction, the Court may retain its 
power some little time, b ut it will instantly lose all its authority; and 
the power of the Court will not long survive the authority  of it: is it 
possible to stab that authority more fatally than by charging the 
Court?   
69.  In the light of the above discussion , it can safely be 
concluded that the contempt of Court  is a criminal offence, which is 
tried summarily by a judge alone, who m ay be the very judge who has 
been injured by the contempt  as against a regular trial . The Judge who 
is being scandalized in special jurisdiction, is not debarred form 
hearing the case. By providing that no court shall take cognizance of 
contempt of Court a rising from an averment made in due course in 
appellate, revisional or review proceedings, till such proceedings have 
been finalized and no further appeal, revision or review lies, section Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  79 
6(3) curtails the power of a Judge, thereby defying the principle o f 
independence of judiciary, which is not permissible.  The provision is 
contrary to the principle of independence of judiciary and right of 
access to justice as enshrined in Articles 2A and 9 of the Constitution. 
It is, therefore, void.   
70.  Subsection (1) of section 8 provides that where, in a case 
in which a Judge has made an order under subsection (1) of section 7, 
not being a case referred to in subsection (4) of that section, the 
alleged contempt of Court involves scandalization personal to such 
Judge  and is not scandalization of the court as a whole or of all the 
Judges of the court, the judge shall forward the record of the case and 
such comments, if any , as he deems fit to make, to the Chief Justice of 
the Court . While giving finding on section 3 of  COCA 2012, it has 
already been held that the use of the words ‘judge in relation to his 
office’ instead of the word ‘Court’ is violative of Article 63(1)(g). 
Besides, the provision by requiring the concerned Judge to forward the 
record of the case along w ith his comments to the Chief Justice of his 
Court takes away the power from the concerned Judge  to punish the 
alleged contemner even in the cases where he may have committed 
contempt of Court  on the face of the Judge. This is violative of the 
principle of  independence of judiciary.   
71.  Subsection (3) of section 8 provides that if, at any stage of 
a case in which the Chief Justice has passed an order under clause (a) 
of subsection (2), the Chief Justice is of opinion that, in the interest of 
justice, the case shall be transferred to another Judge , he may pass an 
order accordingly; and the case shall then be heard by such other 
Judge . It may be mentioned that Order XI of the Supreme Court Rules, 
1980 provides that save as otherwise provided by law or by the se Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  80 
Rules , every cause, appeal or matter shall be heard and disposed of by 
a Bench consisting of not less than three Judges to be nominated by 
the Chief Justice. The proviso to the above Order provides that if the 
Judges hearing a petition or an appeal are equally divided in opinion , 
the petition or appeal shall, in the discretion of the Chief Justice , be 
placed for hearing and disposal either before another Judge or before a 
larger Bench to be nominated by the Chief Justice. It may also be 
mentioned that under rule 7 of Order XXVII  ibid, the contempt matter 
shall, in the first instance, be placed before the Chief Justice and such 
Judges as the Chief Justice may nominate to consider the expediency 
or propriety of taking action in the matter.  
72.  Sh. Ahsanud din ASC has argued that constitution of 
benches is a prerogative of the Chief Justice under Order XI of 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980, but under the impugned Act , this function 
is being taken over by the other organs of the State under a scheme, 
and even thoug h it be not termed as mala fide, yet it is not fair. The 
provision of section 8(3) is directly relatable to the power of the Chief 
Justice in the matter of constitution of benches , which aspect  has 
already formed the subject matter of discussion by this Co urt in a 
large number of cases. In re: M.A. No.657 of 1996 in References Nos. 
1 and 2 of 1996  (PLD 1997 SC 80) , relying upon the cases of Zulfikar 
Ali Bhutto v. The State  (PLD 1978 SC 125) and Malik Hamid Sarfaraz 
v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1979 SC 991 ), it was held that 
application of the party with a request for constitution of Full Bench 
will be covered by Order XI, Supreme Court Rules, 1980 , which 
provides specifically for constitution of Benches by the Chief Justice. It 
is very clearly provided the rein that the Chief Justice may, in a fit 
case, refer any cause or appeal as aforesaid to a larger Bench. Order Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  81 
XXXIII, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules is not attracted in such a 
case as it provides that the Court has inherent powers to make such 
orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse 
of the process of the Court. It was further held that u nder the 
Constitution and the law regulating the practice of the Supreme Court, 
it is not only the privilege but the duty and obligation of the Chief 
Justice to personally preside over all important cases and to nominate 
Judges for hearing cases which come up before the Court. No person 
has the right to ask the Chief Justice to abdicate this responsibility, nor 
does anyone have  the right to  demand a Bench of his own choice. This 
would be contrary to the well established norms regulating the 
functioning of the superior Courts. It is the undisputed privilege and 
duty of the Chief Justice to constitute Benches for the hearing and 
disposal of ca ses coming before Supreme Court and no litigant or 
lawyer can be permitted to ask that his case be heard by a Bench of 
his choice. The above principle was reiterated in Supreme Court Bar 
Association v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2002  SC 939) .  
73.  It is to be noted that the Supreme Court  Rules, 1980 
having been framed under Article  191 of the Constitution have a 
constitutional backing.  Therefore, the Legislature cannot take over the 
duty/function  of the Chief Justice  and other Judges to hear cases 
because  in such eventuality , the Executive would be issuing orders for 
constitution of Benches of their choice for hearing of particular cases, 
which would be interference in the jurisdict ion of the Court as well as 
violation of the principles of independence of judiciary and denial of 
access to justice  enshrined in Articles 2A, 9 and 175 of the 
Constitution . Undoubtedly, these powers are to be exercised by the 
judicial authorities . There is no scope for encroachment upon the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  82 
powers of judicial review of the super ior courts vested in them under 
the Constitution . In Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s case  (supra) this Court 
has held that power and jurisdiction of judicial review could not be 
controlled and fettered. In Khurshid Anwar Khan’s case  (supra) it was 
held that as man dated by Article  2A, independence of judiciary of 
judiciary is to be fully secured . In Mehram Ali’s case  (supra) , the 
provisions of ATA, which militated against the independence of 
judiciary and Article s 175 and 203 of the Constitution were held to be 
invalid whereas in Asad Ali’s case  it was held that right of access to 
impartial and independent courts/tribunals . The provision of subsection 
(3) of section 8 being a clog on the power of the Chief Justice to 
constitute benches is violative of the principle o f independence of 
judiciary  and right of access to justice .    
74.  Subsection (2) of the said section provides that on receipt 
of the papers, mentioned in sub -section (1), the Chief Justice, after 
inviting, if he deems fit, further comments, if any, from the judge first 
taking cognizance of the offence and making such inquiry in such 
manner as he deems fit, shall pass orders specifying another judge, 
which if the Chief Justice so orders, may be the Chief Justice; a Bench 
of judges set up by the Chief Justi ce, of which the judge first taking 
cognizance of the offence is not a member; and the case shall then be 
heard accordingly.  Subsection (4) of the said section provides that 
when, in pursuance of an order under sub -section (2), the Judge first 
taking cogni zance of the case is not hearing the case, the other judge 
or, as the case may be, the Bench of judges hearing the case may 
invite or receive any further comments from the judge first taking 
cognizance of the offence and shall call and hear any witnesses w hom 
such judge desires to be examined, and all comments furnished by the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  83 
judge first taking cognizance of the offence shall be treated as 
evidence in the case and such judge shall not be required to appear to 
give evidence.  Subsection (5) of section 8 prov ides that w hen in a case 
the first cognizance of the offence has been taken by the Chief Justice, 
the functions of the Chief Justice, under subsection (1), (2) and (3) 
shall be performed by a Bench of judges composed of the two next 
most senior judges avai lable. For the reasons ascribed to the provision 
of subsection (3) ibid, the provision of subsection (5) is also not 
sustainable.     
75.  Section 10(b) provides that no material which has been 
expunged from the record under the orders of the presiding offi cer of 
the Senate, the National Assembly, or a Provincial Assembly, shall be 
admissible in evidence. Mr. Abdur Rehman Siddiqui and  Sh. 
Ahsanuddin ASCs argued that Article  19 of the Constitution has been 
violated by the impugned Act, inasmuch as the Fundame ntal Right of  
freedom of speech and expression provided therein is restricted , inter 
alia, in relation to contempt of court . In response, learned Attorney 
General has argued that all these petitions , in essence, and per se 
amount to violation of Fundamenta l Rights  of freedom of speech as 
enshrined in Article  19 of the Constitution , and also its new recognition 
in the proviso to section 3 of the COCA 2012 . He has argued that 
under Article  19 of the Constitution  as well as under Article  19 of the 
United Natio ns Declaration of Human Rights, reasonable restriction can 
be imposed on freedom of speech , inter alia, in relation to contempt  of 
Court , therefore, the defences of fair comments etc., as provided in 
the proviso to section 3 make the new contempt law look like a 
reasonable restriction in terms of Article  19 of the Constitution . He 
argued that there is no conflict between Article 19 and Article  204 of Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  84 
the Constitution  because any law to regulate the exercise of power to 
punish for contempt of Court  must conf orm to the scheme of the 
Constitution and should not ignore any provision of the Constitution .  
76.  It is to be noted that the right to freedom of speech and 
expression guaranteed under Article 19 is subject to reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law, inter alia, in relation to contempt of Court . 
The right to freedom of speech and expression  envisaged by Article  19 
of the Indian Constitution is also subject to similar restriction in 
relation to contempt of Court. Article  19 has been interpreted by this 
Court in its various judgments. In Masroor Ahsan’s case  (supra), it was 
held as under : -  
“Keeping in view the above principle of interpretation of a 
Constitutional provision, it may again be observed that 
Article 19 of the Constitution (which relates to one o f the 
fundamental rights) inter alia provides that every citizen 
shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression 
subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law 
which includes law relating to contempt of Court. In other 
words, the above Arti cle of the Constitution guarantees 
freedom of speech but it is subject to reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in respect of the matters 
mentioned therein including the contempt of Court. A 
Member of the Parliament in addition to his right under 
Article 66 of the Constitution may , as a citizen of Pakistan , 
invoke Article 19 if he makes a speech outside the 
Parliament. However, since aforesaid respondents Nos.3, 
4, 5 and 7 made speeches on the floor of the House, we 
will have to refer to Article 66; clause  (1) of which lays 
down that "Subject to the Constitution and to the rules of 
procedure of Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament), there shall be 
freedom of speech in Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) and no 
member shall be liable to any proceedings in any Court in 
respe ct of anything said or any vote given by him in Majlis -
e-Shoora (Parliament), and no person shall be so liable in 
respect of the publication by or under the authority of 
Majlis -e-Shoora (Parliament) of any report, paper, votes or 
proceedings". The moot que stion is, as to whether the 
words "Subject to the Constitution" which prefixed the 
operative portion of Article 66 makes the above right of 
freedom of speech on the floor subject to other provisions 
of the Constitution, namely, Article 68 which enjoins tha t 
no discussion shall take place in Majlis -e-Shoora 
(Parliament) with respect to the conduct of any Judge of 
the Supreme Court or of a High Court in the discharge of Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  85 
his duties. Furthermore, Article 204 of the Constitution, as 
pointed out hereinabove, has empowered the Supreme 
Court and a High Court to punish "any person" who has 
committed contempt as defined in sub -clauses (a) to (d) 
thereof. In England, it is a well -settled proposition of law 
after the Bill of Rights that a Member of the Parliament 
enjoys  absolute right of freedom of speech. In this regard, 
reference may be made to the following three English 
cases: --  
  
(i) Church of Scientology of California v. Johnson -Smith 
(1972) 1 All England Law Reports, page 378);   
(ii) Wason v. Walter and other s (1861 to 18 73 All 
England Law Reports page 105); and   
(iii) Bradlaugh v. Sossett (1884 QBD Volume XII, page 
271).  
 
Reference may also be made to the following passage from 
Erskine May ’s Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings 
and Usage of Parliament, Twentieth Edition :-- 
  
  “Speeches in Parliament not actionable.  
The absolute privilege of statements made in debate 
is no longer contested, but it may be observed that 
the privilege which formerly protected Members 
against action by the Crown now serves largely as 
protect ion against prosecution by individuals or 
corporate bodies. Subject to the rules of order in 
debate (see Chapter 19), a Member may state 
whatever he thinks fit in debate, however offensive it 
may be to the feelings, or injurious to the character, 
of indivi duals; and he is protected by his privilege 
from any action for libel, as well as from any other 
question or molestation. ”  
25. Since we have a written Constitution of 1973 
containing Articles dealing with the rights of the Members 
of the Parliament and th eir obligations, we cannot derive 
any help from the legal position obtaining in England as to 
the absolute right of freedom of speech enjoyed by the 
Members of the British Parliament. In this view of the 
matter, the judgment of this Court in the case of Pa kistan 
v. Ahmad Saeed Kirmani and  others PLD 1958 SC (Pak.) 
397 with reference to Article 89 of late Constitution of 
1956 (which related to the privilege of the Members of the 
Legislative Assembly) cannot be pressed into service, 
firstly, that the language  used in Article 176 of the late 
Constitution of 1956 relating to the power of the Supreme 
Court and of the High Courts for contempt was couched in 
different language than Article 204 of the Constitution of 
1973. It was in line with Article 129 of the Indi an 
Constitution. Secondly, that the above two Articles, 
namely, Articles 56 and 89 were not prefixed with the 
words “subject to the Constitution ”. 
  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  86 
“92. … … Bare perusal of Article 19 of the Constitution 
postulates reasonable restraints whereby citizen wh ile 
exercising his right of freedom of speech or expression and 
freedom of Press is prohibited to conduct himself in any 
manner which may violate security or defence of Pakistan 
or a part thereof, or could affect friendly relations with 
Foreign States. In the same way citizen under freedom 
clause is bound to ensure that his freedom does not strike 
against public order, decency or morality or provisions 
regarding contempt of Court. The right of freedom further 
prohibits incitement of citizen for committing a ny offence. 
Therefore, owing the responsibility of honouring the 
dictates of Constitution the Supreme Law of the country 
firmly embodied in Article 19 of the Constitution, every 
citizen while making speech, expressing himself or causing 
publication in the press is obligated to refrain from all such 
acts which may be calculated to constitute contempt of 
Court. For emphasis we may impress upon normal 
circumstance, which under the Constitution disdains 
immoral, indecent, anti -State, or un -Islamic publications,  
expressions or speeches. It equally creates an obligation 
for the citizen, while exercising his right to ensure that his 
comment with regard to conduct of a Judge or the Court 
should not be violative of law. From scrutiny of the 
precedent case -law and all  relevant factors coupled with 
fundamental rights, the authors of editorials/articles, 
publishers, editors of newspapers or journals or Advocates 
have bounden duty to avoid from using strikingly pungent 
language which smacks of loud bitterness or aimed at 
emitting intemperate expression or abnormal 
understanding suggesting scandalization of the Court or 
cause obstruction to the impartial administration of justice. 
It appears necessary that citizens, editors or authors while 
making a speech or writing articl es/editorials or arranging 
its publication must not use awkward or disrespectful 
language which may cause ridiculing or undermining the 
prestige of Court. The citizen, therefore, desiring to 
exercise fundamental rights specified under the 
Constitution and law must ow e responsibility of obeying its 
corresponding constraints by satisfying that they are 
acting with bona fides without mens  rea to damage or 
affect the justice system in the country. While exercising 
rights boundaries must be fixed whereby the dis paraging 
or disrespectful remarks or attempts violating law or 
transgressing the limits of fair comments are avoided. 
Truth also can be expressed with noble and constructive 
objectives for institutional improvement by using decent 
and recognised phraseolog y. Ironical or sarcastic  
expression, intemperate speech, immodest or disgraceful 
publication merely with mala fide intentions aimed at 
blackmailing, must be avoided and abhorred. Yellow 
journalism as rightly observed by Mr. Aziz A. Munshi, 
learned counsel for respondent in Criminal Original 
Petitions Nos.18 to 21 of 1995 should be condemned Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  87 
because it affects the requirements of law or Constitution, 
and increase social malady. ”   
 
In the light of the above exposition of the law, it is well settled that a 
citizen while exercising his Fundamental Right of speech and 
expression is obliged to ensure that his comment with regard to 
conduct of a Judge or the Court does not violate the law. Article  19 
contemplates imposition of restrictions, inter alia, in relation  to 
contempt of Court , but here defences have been provided with the 
result that nobody will be punished for contempt of Court. The 
provisions of the impugned law , which  are aimed at devising ways to 
wriggle out of the pale of the contempt law, traverse  the limits 
contemplated by Article  19 of the Constitution.  
77.  The issue of expunction of remarks made by a member of 
any House in violation of Article 68 of the Constitution was discussed 
by this Court in Masroor Ahsan’s case  (supra ) and it was held that in 
view of Article 68 of the Constitution read with clause (c) of sub -rule 
(2) of Rule 248 of the National Assembly Rules, the Speaker is obliged 
not to allow a Member to discuss the conduct of any Judge of the 
Supreme Court or a High Court in the discharg e of his duties and if a 
Member does it in violation of the above provisions, the Speaker is 
expected to take any of the actions envisaged under Rules 267, 268 
and 269 of the aforesaid Rules, i.e., if the remarks are against a Judge 
of the Supreme Court or  a High Court, it is to be referred to the 
concerned Chief Justice and where the remarks are against a Judge of 
the subordinate court, to the Registrar of the concerned High Court. It 
was further held that an expunction order in respect of the offending 
portion of a speech at the fag -end of the session would not be a 
defence to an action under Article 204 of the Constitution. It is, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  88 
therefore, clear that only such remarks will be expunged, which are 
not derogatory. In case of derogatory remarks, the Speaker  of the 
National Assembly and the Chairman Senate are under a constitutional 
obligation to take action in terms of the aforesaid Rules, inasmuch as 
the expunction of derogatory remarks would be contrary to 
Constitution and law . Accordingly, section 10(b) i s not sustainable and 
is declared to be void.  
78.   Section 11 (3) provides that an intra -court appeal shall lie 
against the issuance of a show cause notice or an original order 
including an interim order passed by a Bench of the Supreme Court in 
any case , including a pending case, to a larger bench consisting of the 
remaining available judges of the Court within the country and in the 
event the impugned show cause or order has been passed by half or 
more of the judges of Court, the matter shall, on the ap plication of an 
aggrieved person, be put up for re -appraisal before the full court and 
the operation of the impugned show cause notice or order shall remain 
suspended until the final disposal of the matter. The first proviso to 
section 11(3) renders the wh ole proceedings of contempt of Court 
ineffective as at the initial stage after issuing a show cause notice, Full 
Court will have to be assembled to examine the grievance of the 
contemner if the show cause notice has been issued by half of the 
Judges wherea s under the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, even very high 
profile cases may be decided by a two -Member Bench.  The second 
proviso to section 11(3), which provides for automatic suspension of a 
judicial order, is violative of the principle of trichotomy of power  and 
the independence of judiciary. Hence, the provision in question is 
contrary to settled principles governing the grant or refusal of interim Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  89 
orders, besides being violative of the principle of independence of 
Judiciary.   
79.   Mr. A.K. Dogar, Sr. ASC h as argued that section 11(3) is 
violative of all jurisprudence inasmuch as it is against the principle of 
prompt, summary and quick punishment. Other learned 
counsel/petitioners have also made similar argument. In response, it is 
argued on behalf of the Fe deration that the provision is not 
unprecedented, inasmuch as a similar provision existed in the 
Contempt of Court Act, 1976, which was never challenged by anyone 
during its currency and enforcement.  
80.  The statement of objects and purposes annexed to t he 
Contempt of Court Bill, 2012, inter alia, envisaged to provide to the 
alleged accused to have fair trial including transparent procedure for 
right to appeal and the right to appeal was being streamlined . 
However, what has been done is that a bench of th e available judges 
in the country is contemplated to be constituted for hearing of appeal 
against a show cause notice or an original order including an interim 
order passed by a Bench of the Supreme Court in any case, including a 
pending case to a larger B ench consisting of all the remaining available 
Judges of the Court within the country, and in the event the impugned 
show cause or order has been passed by half or more of the judges, 
the matter shall, on the application of an aggrieved person, be put up 
for reappraisal by the full court. As noted in the history of the 
contempt law in the beginning of the judgment, a similar provision was 
enacted in the COCA 1976 by way of an amendment when the then 
Prime Minister was facing the contempt proceedings. Howeve r, 
subsequently, when the aforesaid law was repealed, the aforesaid 
provision of appeal was not re -enacted in the new law of contempt. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  90 
Such a provision, it appears, was drafted to meet a particular situation 
then prevailing. Incidentally, a similar situati on had arisen in the 
recent past where the sitting Prime Minister faced contempt of Court  
charge who was ultimately convicted for it and disqualified from being 
a member of the Parliament as also the Prime Minister. The Prime 
Minister elected thereafter is  sailing in the same boat and is before the 
Court to answer the charge of contempt of Court  for non -compliance 
with the order passed in Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s case . In this backdrop, 
the impugned COCA 2012 was promulgated, section 11(3) whereof, 
inter alia, provided for the right of appeal as discussed hereinabove.  
81.  Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC has referred to the case titled as In 
the matter of:  Special Reference by the President Under Article 143  
(AIR 1965 SC 745)  wherein  the President of India sent a Specia l 
Reference under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to the Indian 
Supreme Court for its opinion on five questions. The background of the 
Reference was that on 14.03.1964, the Speaker of the Legislative 
Assembly of Uttar Pradesh administered, in the name o f and under the 
orders of the Legislative Assembly, a reprimand to one Keshav Singh 
for having committed contempt of the House and also for having 
committed a breach of the privileges of Narsingh Narain Pandey, a 
member of the House by getting printed and published a pamphlet 
which bore the signature of Keshav Singh along with the signature of 
other persons. In pursuance of the decision taken by the House later 
on the same day, the Speaker directed that Keshav Singh be 
committed to prison for committing ano ther contempt of the House by 
his conduct in the House when he was summoned to receive the 
aforesaid reprimand and for writing a disrespectful letter to the 
Speaker of the House earlier. According to this order, a warrant was Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  91 
issued under  the signature of the Speaker of the House directing that 
Keshav Singh be detained in Jail for a period of seven days, and in 
execution of the warrant , Keshav Singh was detained in Jail. On 
19.03.1964, Mr. B. Solomon Advocate presented a petition to the High 
Court on behalf  on Keshav Singh under section 491 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, as well as under Article 226 of the 
Constitution. The matter was fixed before  N.U. Beg and G.D. Sahgal 
JJ., when the petition was admitted and notice was ordered to be 
issued to th e respondents. It was further ordered  that the applicant 
should be released on bail. The Deputy Registrar of the Court was 
asked to take necessary action in connection with the Order. On 
21.03.1964 , the House proceeded to take action against the two 
Judges  who passed the order on Keshav Singh ’s application, as well as 
Keshav Singh and his Advocate. The House by its resolution dated 
21.03.1964 took the view that M/ S G.D. Sahgal, N.U. Beg, Keshav 
Singh and B. Solomon had committed contempt of the House and , 
therefore, it was ordered that Keshav Singh should immediately be 
taken into custody and kept confined in Jail for the remaining term of 
his imprisonment and M/ S N.U. Beg, G.D. Sahgal and B. Solomon 
should be brought in custody before the House. The two Jud ges, 
immediately after coming to know about the said resolution 
approached the Allahabad High Court with separate petitions under 
Article 226 of the Constitution. On the same day , a Full Bench of the 
Allahabad High Court consisting of 28 Judges after takin g up the case 
directed that the said petitions should be admitted and ordered for 
issuance of notices against the respondents restraining the Speaker 
from issuing the warrant in pursuance of the direction of the House 
given to him on 21.03.1964, and from s ecuring execution of the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  92 
warrant if already issued, and restraining the Government of U.P. and 
the Marshal of the House from executing the warrant. Mr. Solomon, 
Advocate, on 25.03.1964, presented a similar petition which was also 
heard by the Full Bench of  28 Judges and after admitting the petition, 
an interim order was passed prohibiting the implementation of the 
resolution the validity of which was challenged by the petitioner. On 
the same day, the House passed a clarificatory resolution wherein it 
was re solved that the question of contempt may be decided after 
giving an opportunity of explanation to the persons named in the 
original resolution of 20.03.1964 according to rules. As a result of the 
said resolution, the warrants issued for the arrest of the t wo Judges 
and Mr. Solomon were withdrawn, with the result that the two learned 
Judges and Mr. Solomon were placed under an obligation to appear 
before the House and offer their explanations as to why the House 
should not proceed against them for their alle ged contempt of the 
House. In the said circumstances, on 26 .03.1964, the President made 
a reference under Art icle 143(1) of the Constitution  mentioning therein 
that the incidents in question had given rise to a serious conflict 
between a High Court and a S tate Legislature which involved 
important and complicated questions of law regarding the powers and 
jurisdiction of the High Court and its Judges in relation to the State 
Legislature and its officers and regarding the powers, privileges and 
immunities of t he State Legislature and its members in relation to the 
High Court and its Judges in the discharge of their duties. The Court 
held as under: -  
“59. Whilst we are considering this aspect of the matter, 
it is relevant to emphasise that the conflict which ha s 
arisen between the High Court and the House is, strictly 
speaking, not a conflict between the High Court as and the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  93 
House as such, but between the House and a citizen of this 
country. Keshav Singh claims certain fundamental rights 
which are guaranteed by  the Constitution and he seeks to 
move the High Court under Art. 226 on the ground that his 
fundamental rights have been contravened illegally. The 
High Court purporting to exercise its power under Art. 
226(1), seeks to examine the merits of the claims mad e by 
Keshav Singh and issues an interim order. It is this interim 
order which has led to the present unfortunate 
controversy. No doubt, by virtue of the resolution passed 
by the House requiring the Judges to appear before the 
Bar of the House to explain th eir conduct, the controversy 
has developed into one between the High Court and the 
House; but it is because the High Court in the discharge of 
its duties as such Court intervened to enquire into the 
allegations made by a citizen that the Judges have been 
compelled to enter the arena. Basically and fundamentally, 
the controversy is between a citizen of Uttar Pradesh and 
the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. That is why in 
dealing with the question about the extent of the powers of 
the House in dealing with  cases of contempt committed 
outside its four -walls, the provisions of Art. 226 and Art. 
32 assume significance. We have already pointed out that 
in Pandit Sharma ([1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 806 this Court 
has held that Art. 21 applies where powers are exercise d 
by the legislature under the latter part of Art. 194(3). If a 
citizen move s the High Court on the ground that his 
fundamental right under Art. 21 has been contravened, the 
High Court would be entitled to examine his claim, and 
that itself would introduce  some limitation on the extent of 
the powers claimed by the House in the present 
proceedings. ” 
 
The underlying issue for which this judgment has been referred to by 
the learned counsel is that there is always a shade of difference of 
opinion between the Ju diciary and the Parliament.  
82.  It may be observed that the Contempt of Court  Ordinance, 
2003, which  was holding the field prior to the promulgation of COCA 
2012, fully catered to this aspect.  Section 19 of the Contempt of Court 
Ordinance, 2003 dealt wit h the filing of appeal against orders passed Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  94 
by the Superior Court s under which, i n the case of an order passed by 
a single judge of a High Court an intra -court appeal shall lie to a bench 
of two or more judges;  in a case in which the original order has be en 
passed by a division or larger bench of a High Court an appeal shall lie 
to the Supreme Court; and  in the case of an original order passed by a 
single judge or a bench of two judges of the Supreme Court an intra -
court appeal shall lie to a bench of thre e judges and in case the 
original order was passed by a bench of three or more judges an intra -
court appeal shall lie to a bench of five or more judges.  Subsection  (2) 
provided that t he appellate court may suspend the impugned order 
pending disposal of the  appeal.  The provision remained operational for 
quite some time.  In the case of Abdul Hameed Dogar, Former Judge v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2011 SC 315) the original order of framing 
of charge against the former Judges of the superior Courts was passed  
by a 4 -Member Bench of this Court. The said order was challenged by 
means of intra -court appeal which was heard by a larger Bench 
comprising 7 Hon’ble Judges. In the case of Justice Hasnat Ahmed 
Khan v. Federation of Pakistan/State  (PLD 2011 SC 680),  the original 
order was passed by a 4 -Member Bench of this Court and the intra -
court appeal was heard by a Bench comprising 6 Hon’ble Judges. In 
the case of Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, Prime Minister of Pakistan v. 
Assistant Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan  (2012 SCMR 422), the 
original order was passed by a 7 -Member Bench of this Court and the 
intra-court appeal filed under section 19 ibid was heard by a larger 
Bench comprising 8 Hon’ble Judges. In Contempt proceedings against 
Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani  (PLD 20 12 SC 553) the respondent 
objected to his trial by a seven Member Bench on the ground that 
after the charge was framed the Bench had became not competent Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  95 
to try the respondent,  as such  the trial by the same Bench  militates 
against the principle of ‘due pro cess’ in terms of Article 10A of the 
Constitution . The Court held that the principle of right to 'fair trial' 
has been acknowledged and recognized by our Courts since long and 
is by now well entrenched in our jurisprudence. The right to a ‘fair 
trial’ undo ubtedly means a right to a proper hearing by an unbiased 
competent forum. The latter component of a ‘fair tria l’ is based on 
the age -old maxim “ Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa ” 
that “no man can be a judge in his own cause ”. It was further held 
that this principle has been further expounded to mean that a Judge 
must not hear a case in which he has personal interest, whether or 
not his decision is influenced by his interest, for ”justice should not 
only be done but be seen to have been done”.  The C ourt relied upon 
the case of the President v. Shaukat Ali  (PLD 1971 SC 585)  and 
Federation of Pakistan v. Muhammad Akram Sheikh  (PLD 1989 SC 
689). In the first case one of the objections raised by the 
respondent Judge was that the Supreme Judicial Council was 
disqualified from hearing the Reference, as it had earlier scrutinized 
the declaration of the assets of the respondent and was, therefore, 
bound to be biased. The objection was rejected on two grounds; 
firstly, that there was no question or allegation of any bias on any 
individual member of the Supreme Judicial Council and the mere fact 
that the Council had scrutinized the declaration of assets was not 
sufficient to est ablish the likelihood of bias: “ for, if it were so then 
no Judge who issues a rule in  a motion or issues notice to show 
cause in any other proceedings or frames a charge in a trial can ever 
hear that matter or conduct that trial. The reason is that a 
preliminary inquiry intended to determine whether a prima facie Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  96 
case has been made out or not is a safeguard against the 
commencement of wholly unwarranted final proceedings against a 
person. To say that a charge should be framed against a person 
amounts to saying nothing more than that the person should be 
tried in respect of it. Anybody who k nows the difference between the 
prima facie case and its final trial, would reject  the objection as 
misconceived.”  The second ground for rejecting the objection was 
that of necessity, in that if sustained, there would be no forum or 
tribunal to hear the Re ference, as the Supreme Judicial Council had 
the exclusive jurisdiction to hear the Reference and all its members 
had at the preliminary stage scrutinized the statement of declaration 
of assets of the Judge.  In the second case this Court, while 
reaffir ming that the principle that “ no one should be a judge in his 
own cause and justice should not only be done but should manifestly 
appear to have been done, were very salutary and fully entrenched 
judicial principles of high standard ”, acknowledged that a Judge , 
when otherwise disqualified on account of the said principles, may 
still sit in the proceedings if in his absence the tribunal or the Court 
having exclusive jurisdiction would not be complete.  It was further 
held as under: - 
“28. In the case of THE PRESID ENT v. SHAUKAT ALI 
ibid) the Supreme Judicial Council had on its own 
motion, after scrutinizing the statement of the 
respondent Judge, made a report to the President. The 
pronouncement by the then Chief Justice Hamoodur 
Rahman provides a complete answer to  the objection of 
the learned counsel for the defence. The learned counsel 
had tried to draw a distinction between the exercise of 
contempt jurisdiction by the Court on its own motion and 
on the complaint of a party and it was contended that it 
is only in the former case that a Judge would stand 
disqualified to try a contemnor. This distinction we do 
not consider to be material. In both situations a Judge 
applies his mind before issuing notice to the respondent 
and later is to form a prima facie opinion aft er Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  97 
preliminary hearing whether or not to frame a charge 
and proceed with the trial. If it is held that a Judge 
holding a trial after having formed a prima facie or 
tentative opinion on merits of a case violates a litigant's 
fundamental right guaranteed und er Article 10A, it would 
lead to striking down a number of procedural laws and 
well established practices, and may land our judicial 
system into confusion and chaos; a Judge, who frames a 
charge in every criminal case, will stand debarred from 
holding tria l of the accused; a Judge hearing a bail 
matter and forming a tentative opinion of the 
prosecution case would then be disqualified to try the 
accused; a Judge expressing a prima facie opinion while 
deciding a prayer for grant of injunction would become 
incompetent to try the suit. There may be scores of other 
such situations. Be that as it may, in all such situations 
the cause is not personal to the Judge and he has no 
personal interest in the matter to disqualify him.  
29. The exception recognized by the tw o judgments of 
this Court cited above on the ground of necessity to the 
rule that "no person shall be a judge in his own cause" is 
also attracted here. After the show cause notice was 
issued to the respondent, a preliminary hearing was 
afforded to the resp ondent in terms of Subsection (3) of 
Section 17 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003. 
Upon conclusion of the hearing we decided to proceed 
further and frame a charge against the respondent. This 
order was challenged through an Intra -Court Appeal filed 
under section 19 of the Ordinance. It was heard by an 
eight-member Bench of this Court, headed by the 
Hon'ble Chief Justice. The Appeal was dismissed and the 
order by this Bench, forming a prima facie opinion to 
frame the charge against the respondent, was upheld. 
Like the present, the Bench hearing the Intra -Court 
Appeal had also applied its mind to the existence or 
otherwise of a prima facie case. If the argument of the 
learned counsel is accepted, all the members of the 
Bench hearing the Intra -Court Appea l would be equally 
disqualified, thus, leaving only one Hon'ble Judge of this 
Court unaffected. No Bench could then be constituted to 
hear the contempt matter.   
34. From the foregoing discussion, it follows that a 
Judge, making a prima facie assessment of a contempt 
matter whether initiated suo motu or on the application 
of a party, does not stand disqualified on the touchstone 
of the requirements of a 'fair trial', from hearing and 
deciding the matter. Thus our trial of the respondent 
does not infringe upo n the respondent's fundamental 
right to a fair trial enshrined in Article 10A of the 
Constitution. The objection on this account is, therefore, 
not sustained. ”   
 
83.  No doubt, right of appeal is a creation of the statute and 
unless specifically conferred , it would not be available . If a statute Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  98 
does not confer right of appeal, it does not exist. See  Multan Electric 
Power Company Ltd. through Chief Executive v. Muhammad Ashiq  
(PLD 2006  SC 328), Muhammad Siddique  v. Lahore High Court, Lahore  
(PLD 2003 SC 88 5) and Pakistan  v. Abdul Hayee Khan  (PLD 1995 SC 
418). In this behalf , it may be noted that rule 5(1) of Order XLI of Civil 
Procedure Code, 1908 provides that an appeal shall not operate as a 
stay of proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except  so 
far as the Appellate Court may order, nor shall execution of a decree 
be stayed by reason only of an appeal having been preferred from the 
decree; but the Appellate Court may , for sufficient cause , order stay of 
execution of such decree. Under sub-rule (2) of the said rule, where an 
application is made for stay of execution of an appealable decree 
before the expiration of the time allowed for appealing therefrom, the 
Court which passed the decree may , on sufficient cause being shown , 
order the execution  to be stayed. However, sub -rule (3) of the said 
rule provides that no order for stay of execution shall be made under 
sub-rule (1) or sub -rule (2) unless the Court making it is satisfied (a) 
that substantial loss may result to the party applying for stay of 
execution unless the order is made; (b) that the application has been 
made without unreasonable delay; and (c) that security has been 
given by the applicant for the due performance of such decree or order 
as may ultimately be binding upon him.  In Shah W ali v. Ghulam Din 
alias Gaman and another  (PLD 1966 SC 983), H.M. Fazil Zaheer v. Kh. 
Abdul Hameed  (1983 SCMR 906) and Government of Punjab through 
Secretary, Labour and Manpower  v. Shahid Mehmood Butt  [2006 PLC 
(C.S.) 325]  it has been held that the operat ion of a decree passed by a 
court of first instance is not automatically suspended on mere filing of 
appeal therefrom . In Naeem Ullah Khalid  v. Dr. Hafiz Mushtaq Ahmad  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  99 
(2007 YLR 1418)  and Mian Ghulam Yasin v.  Election Commission of 
Pakistan  (2007 CLC 304) the Lahore High Court has held that m ere 
filing of appeal  against a decree or order does not operate as stay of 
proceedings , unless Appellate Court specifically stays the proceedings  
or grants injunction. This position is recognized by the Supreme Court  
in its rules of procedure “ Supreme Court  Rules, 1980” under Order XX, 
rule 1, which provides that the filing of a petition for leave to appeal or 
an appeal shall not prevent execution of the decree  or order appealed 
against, but the Court may, subject to suc h terms and conditions as it 
may deem fit to impose, order a stay of execution of the decree or 
order, or order a stay of proceedings, in any case under appeal to th e 
Court. The rationale for the proposition is that stay is granted when 
the Court finds tha t the appellant has arguable case , that the balance 
of convenience lies in his favour and not staying the impugned action 
would involve the parties into unnecessary expense and waste of time 
if the appeal eventually succeeded against the impugned order.  
84.  Coming to the issue in hand, it may be noted that n ot only 
the issuance of a show cause notice, or the passing of an original order 
including an interim order by a Bench of the Supreme Court are 
judicial functions, but also the matter of continuance or  otherwise of 
any such order is to be decided by the Judge/Bench concerned 
discharg ing his judicial functions  by applying judicial mind . How can he 
be denuded of this important part of the power to punish for contempt 
of Court? The provision of appeal and the co mposition of a larger 
bench , convening of full court  for the hearing of such appeal and 
automatic suspension of the operation of the impugned order as 
introduced by section 11(3) appears to be aimed at causing hindrance 
in proceeding with contempt of  Court  cases smoothly and quickly, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  100 
particularly those concerning the public office holders . It was frankly 
admitted by the learned counsel for the Federation himself  that the 
impugned law was brought to save the incumbent Prime Minister .  
85.   Section 11( 4) prescribes limitation of 30 days for filing of 
appeal to a Bench of the High Court and 60 days in the case of an 
appeal to the Supreme Court from the date of the order appealed 
against whereas under clause (5) ibid, an intra -court appeal or 
application for re -appraisal may be filed within 30 days from the date 
of show cause notice or the order, as the case may be. Mr. M. Zafar, 
Sr. ASC has argued that although there is no cavil with the proposition 
that appeal is creation of statute and further there is no dispute that 
limitation under the law can be prescribed for filing petitions, appeals, 
reviews, however, in the instant case, this being a contempt law, it 
cannot be allowed that after the contempt is committed, the accused 
will be held accountable for his act of commission or omission some 
time in the distant future. Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC has submitted that 
under the provisions of the impugned Act, the action against 
commission of contempt of Court has been subordinated to a 
procedure which is very time  consuming, although the accused in such 
a case remains present in the court, therefore, there is no logic for 60 
days’ period of limitation for filing of appeal before the Supreme Court 
instead of 30 days, which is the normal period for filing an appeal. He 
also contended that this again is a discriminatory treatment. Article 
37(d) of the Constitution mandates the State to ensure inexpensive 
and expeditious justice. The provision in question is clearly violative of 
the said mandate inasmuch as it delays th e decision of contempt cases 
and compromises the expeditious disposal of such cases to restore the 
dignity of the Courts, who are responsible for administration of justice. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  101 
As mentioned earlier, the law empowers the courts of law to punish for 
its contempt  swiftly and promptly punish a person without recourse to 
a formal and lengthy trial  to uphold the majesty of law and the dignity 
of courts and protect their image in the eyes of the members of the 
public  and to prevent undue interference with the administ ration of 
justice  and independence of judiciary .  
86.  Section 12 of COCA 2012 provides that the Federal 
Government may make rules, not inconsistent with the provisions of 
the Act, providing for any matter relating to the procedure. The COCA 
2012 has been passed in exercise of powers conferred by Article 
204(3) under which two institutions of the State have been given 
power – one, the Parliament to make the law to regulate the exercise 
of power conferred on a Court under this Article because the 
Constitutio n has not mentioned the procedure how Article 204 is to be 
enforced; and two, the Court to make rules subject to law made by the 
Parliament. However, as mentioned earlier, t he Parliament, in making 
a law in terms of clause (3) of this Article , cannot reduc e powers of the 
Court conferred by Article 204(a), (b) & (c), though it may enlarge the 
powers of the Court to punish for contempt while exercising its power 
under Article 204 (2)(d) . The purpose of the law to be made by the 
Parliament in terms of clause (3 ) ibid is to provide for and to regulate 
the system to achieve the object of clauses (1) and (2) of Article 204 
of the Constitution. However, in so doing, the Legislature cannot 
curtail power of a Court to punish for its contempt conferred by Article 
204. The learned counsel for the petitioners have challenged the 
constitutionality of this provision on the ground that it is violative of 
the clause (3) of Article 204 of the Constitution, which provides that 
the exercise of the power conferred on a Court by t his Article may be Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  102 
regulated by law and, subject to law, by rules made by the Court. In 
presence of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, there is hardly any 
occasion for framing any other rules by the Federal Government as is 
purported to be provided under section 12 of COCA 2012. Confronted 
with the above position, the learned counsel for the Federation frankly 
conceded that section 12 is not in line with the provision of aforesaid 
clause (3), which confers the rule making power on the Court . 
Accordingly, sectio n 12 is declared to be ultra vires of the said 
constitutional provision.  
87.  By subsection (1) section 13 of COCA 2012 the Contempt 
of Court Ordinance, 2003 (V of 2003) has been repealed whereas 
subsection (2) ibid provides that for removal of doubt it i s declared 
that the Contempt of Court Act, 1976  (LXIV of 1976), Contempt of 
Court Ordinance, 2003 (IV of 2003) and Contempt of Court Ordinance, 
2004 (I of 2004) stand repealed. Sh. Ahsanuddin ASC for the 
petitioner in Constitution Petition No. 86 of 2012 has argued that  the 
Contempt of Court  Ordinance 2003 stood protected by means of Article 
270AA as inserted by the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Constitutional 
Amendments, therefore, the same could not be repealed by COCA 
2012.  
88.  As noted hereinabove, the C ontempt of Court Ordinance 
No. V of 2003 was promulgated  on 15.12.2003  whereby the  COCA 
1976 was repealed. During the currency of the said Ordinance No. V of 
2003, Article 270AA was inserted into the Constitution by means of the 
Constitution (Seventeenth A mendment) Act, 2003  on 31.12.2003 , 
which continued in force certain legislative measures including the 
Ordinance No. V of 2003 until “altered, repealed or amended by the 
competent authority”. However, o n 15.07.2004, the Contempt of Court Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  103 
Ordinance, 2004 (O rdinance No. I of 2004) was promulgated, which 
was made applicable with effect from 15.04.2004, the day when the 
Ordinance No.  V of 2003 would have expired in the ordinary course. By 
means of Ordinance No. I of 2004, COCA 1976 was once again 
repealed, but not the Ordinance V of 2003, presumably on account of 
its supposed expiry after a period of 120 days as provided in Article 89 
of the Constitution. The reafter, the  Ordinance No. I of 2004 was 
repealed on 14.11.2004 on expiry of 120 days. Later on, by the 
Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act 2010 , Article 270AA was 
reinserted , as such the Ordinance No. V of 2003 continued to be in 
force.  
89.   In view of t he successive repeals of the contempt laws 
promulgated from time to time, the question before us in the instant 
case is which contempt law was prevailing in the country  prior to the 
promulgation of COCA 2012 . This issue was first dealt with by this 
Court in Suo Motu Case No.1 OF 2007  (PLD 2007 SC 688), wherein 
initially the charge was framed against the contemner s under COCA 
1976.  However , during hearing of the case , it was pointed out that the 
Ordinance No.  V of 2003 was holding the field in view of the provision 
of Article 270AA as inserted under the Seventeenth Constitutional 
Amendment, whereupon the c harge was amended and proceedings 
were finalized under the Ordinance No.  V of 2003.  The issue was again 
considered i n the case of Hasnat Ahmad Khan v. Institution Officer  
(2010 SCMR 354)  wherein  it was held  that Ordinance No. V of 2003, 
was holding the fie ld in pursuance of the blanket cover provided by 
clause (3) of Article 270AA as inserted by the Seventeenth 
Constitutional Amendment. In this case, the judgment in Suo Motu 
Case No.1 OF 2007  was quoted with approval. In Justice Hasnat Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  104 
Ahmed Khan v. Registr ar, Supreme Court of Pakistan  (PLD 2010 SC 
806), it has been held as under: -   
“12.  We may add that the Supreme Court and the High 
Courts derive power to punish contemnors from Article 204 
of the Constitution, and are not dependant upon sub -
constitutiona l legislation. Clause 3 of the Article only 
provides that the exercise of power conferred upon the 
Court under the Article may be regulated by law and, 
subject to law, by rules made by the Court. All the 
foregoing statutes from the Contempt of Court Act, 1 976, 
onwards have been enacted with reference to Clause 3 of 
Article 204.  
13.  We now take up the argument that since notices to 
the petitioners and the respondents in the connected 
matters were issued under Contempt of Court Act, 1976 in 
accordance with the order of a 14 Members Bench dated 
13.10.2009 a 5 Member Bench could not alter the 
provision of law. Indeed, the notices were issued “under 
Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 3 and 4 
of the Contempt of Court Act, 1976 or any other enabli ng 
provisions of the relevant law”. Reference to “any other 
enabling provision of the relevant law”, in the notices was 
in the alternative to the provisions of the Contempt of 
Court Act, 1976. Perhaps this phrase was added as a 
precaution as there was stil l some controversy prevailing 
at the time as to whether or not the Contempt of Court 
Act, 1976 stood effectively repealed and replaced by 
Ordinance V of 2003. The argument that the said phrase 
be read as ejusdem generis with the Contempt of Court 
Act, 1976 , is untenable in that the ‘enabling provisions’ 
mentioned in the phrase is followed by the words ‘of the 
relevant law’. If it was intended to refer to the enabling 
provisions of the Contempt of Court Act, 1976, it would not 
have been qualified by the word s ‘the relevant law’, the 
relevant law means law other than the 1976 Act, if so 
found relevant. We have already held that the Ordinance V 
of 2003 is the relevant law. It is, therefore, not necessary 
to refer the case back to a larger Bench for rectifying t he 
order of issuing notices.   
14.  In view of our finding that the 1976 Act stands 
repealed, the argument that these constitution petitions be 
heard as Intra Court Appeals under section 10(2 -A) of the 
Act need not be dilated upon. Above are the reasons for  
the short order dated 4 .5.2010, the operative paragraphs 
6 and 7 are reproduced: --  
“6. We find neither of the two contentions tenable, 
and hold that the Contempt of Court Ordinance 
(No.V of 2003) has been given permanence and 
protection by Article 270AA as substituted by the 
Constitution (17th Amendment) Act, 2003 as well as 
by the Constitution (18th Amendment) Act, 2010 
and section 20 of the Ordinance has repealed the 
Contempt of Court Act, 1976. Thus, no intra court Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  105 
appeal under section 10(2 -A) of the C ontempt of 
Court Act, 1976 is maintainable. Since we have held 
that the Ordinance V of 2003 is the law in force 
regulating proceedings of contempt of Court, the 
said Ordinance is the “relevant law” mentioned in the 
notices issued to the petitioners. Accord ingly, the 
notices to the petitioners as well as to the others in 
the connected criminal original petitions, shall be 
read as having been issued under Article 204 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan read 
with sections 3 and 5 of the Con tempt of Court 
Ordinance, 2003 (Ordinance V of 2003). ”  
 
Again , in the case of Justice Hasnat Ahmed Khan v. Federation of 
Pakistan/State  (PLD 2011 SC 680) it was held as under: -  
“59. Dr. Abdul Basit, learned counsel raised question 
that under the Eightee nth and Nineteenth Constitutional 
Amendments the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 has 
not been protected. This argument is not available to 
him for the reasons that this Court has already held in In 
re: Suo Motu Case No.1 of 2007  (PLD 2007 SC 688) that 
the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 (No. V of 2003) 
was accorded permanence by means of Article 270AA 
incorporated in the Constitution by the Seventeenth 
Constitutional Amendment.  It is to be further added that 
in Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment all l aws 
including President ’s Orders, Acts, Ordinances, etc. made 
between 12.10.1999 and 31.12.2003 to be in force until 
altered, repealed or amended by the competent authority 
including the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 have 
been protected.”  
 
Finally, in  the case of contempt of Court against former Prime Minister 
Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani titled as Criminal Original Petition No. 6 of 
2012 in Suo Motu Case No. 4 of 2010  (PLD 2012 SC 553) , the issue 
was again agitated by learned Attorney General  before a 7 -Member 
Bench  by submitting that there was no law of contempt in force in 
the country  as the  Contempt of Court Ordinance No. V of 2003 
having lapsed by efflux of time under Article 89 stood repealed 
under Article 264 of the Constitution and that Article 270A A did not 
protect the said Ordinance. The Court after considering the above 
referred cases held as under: -  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  106 
“47. … … … This question squarely came before this 
Court in Suo Motu Case No.1 of 2007 (PLD 2007 SC 688) 
where it was held that the Contempt of Cou rt Ordinance 
(V of 2003) holds the field. This judgment had been 
affirmed by this Court in Justice Hasnat Ahmed Khan v. 
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 680). It was 
pointed ou t to the learned Attorney  General that even if 
there was no sub -constitutiona l legislation regulating 
proceedings of Contempt of Court, this Court was 
possessed of constitutional power under Article 204 to 
punish contemnors, with no restrictions on the exercise 
of power including that regarding quantum of 
punishment that can be imp osed on the contemn er.”   
 
90.  The learned Attorney General has argued that the question 
as to which law of contempt was in force prior to COCA 2012 is 
pending determination in the case of in Suo Motu Case No.1 of 2007 
wherein a 16 – Member Bench  had susp ended the operation of the 
impugned judgment convicting and sentencing the alleged contemners 
therein , therefore, the question as to which contempt law was holding 
the field is still sub judice  and is to be decided by a 16 – Member 
Bench. He further argued  that after the repeal of Contempt of Court 
Ordinance No. I of 2004, which was promulgated after the repeal of 
Contempt of Court Ordinance No. V of 2003, practically there was no 
contempt law in the country and reference to the latter Ordinance as 
the law of the land on the subject was not correct position of law. The 
learned counsel for the Federation , however,  has taken the plea that 
there was confusion as to which law was holding the field, which factor 
has been noticed in the statement of objects and re asons annexed to 
the Contempt of Court Bill, 2012, therefore, section 13 (2) has been 
enacted for the removal of doubts.  
91.  The argument of the learned Attorney General has no 
force. The issue as to which contempt law was holding the field has 
already been settled in the above referred cases wherein it was made 
clear that the Contempt of Court Ordinance No. V of 2003 was Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  107 
continuing on the statute book  prior to the promulgation of COCA 
2012. The case referred to by the learned Attorney General is directed 
against the conviction and sentence passed against the alleged 
contemners in the said case , which  being a distinct matter is to be 
decided separately.   
92.  Now, the question is whether there was any necessity to 
repeal the Contempt of Court Ordinance , 2003. The preamble to the 
COCA 2012  states that it is expedient to repeal and re -enact the law of 
contempt in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (3) of Article  
204 of the Constitution. Applying the doctrine of mischief, which has 
been discussed in det ail hereinabove, it can safely be held that there 
was no necessity of repealing Ordinance V of 2003. As discussed 
hereinabove in the light of Khalid Masood’s case  (supra), a law can 
only be promulgated under Article  204(3) of the Constitution to 
regulate the exercise of power to punish for contempt. However , when 
a law, namely,  Ordinance V of 2003  was already holding the field , 
whose constitutionality had not been question ed, and the cases 
including case of Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani noted hereinabove , relev ant 
para therefrom has already been reproduced hereinbefore,  had been 
decided under the said law , therefore, no other conclusion could be 
drawn that the COCA 2012  was promulgated against the statement of 
object s and purpose s included in the Bill, as also t he preamble of 
COCA 2012  itself. It was also  violative of the mandate of Article  
204(3).  
93.  In addition to it, as mentioned earlier, section 13 (1) of 
COCA 2012  has repealed the Contempt of Court  Ordinance, 2003 
whereas under section 13(2) ibid for remov al of doubts, it is declared 
that the Contempt of Court  Act, 1976, the Contempt of Court  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  108 
Ordinance, 2003 and the Contempt of Court  Ordinance, 2004 are 
repealed . It is pertinent to mention that the Contempt of Court  Act, 
1976 had been repealed for the fist time on 27.10.1998 by means of 
Contempt of Court  Ordinance X of 1998. It was repealed for the 
second time on 10.03.2003 when the contempt of Court  Ordinance IV 
of 2003 was promulgated. It was then repealed on 15.12.2003 when 
the contempt of Court  Ordinance  V of 2003 was promulgated and 
lastly, it was repealed on 15.07.2004 on promulgation of the contempt 
of Court  Ordinance I of 2004.  Similarly, the contempt of Court  
Ordinance I of 2004 was repealed on 14.11.2004 in terms of Article  89 
of the Constitution. T his Court has, time and again , held that the 
contempt of Court  Ordinance V of 2003 is holding the field as 
discussed above. In such a situation, the argument  raised by Mr. 
Shahid Orakzai seem s to be valid that after the Eighteenth 
Constitutional Amendment,  the Parliament is not empowered to 
promulgate any such law , as all criminal law s are to be promulgated 
by the Provincial Legislature s. The Contempt of Court  Ordinance V of 
2003 has been given permanence by the Seventeenth & Eighteenth 
Constitution al Amend ments, which aspect has not been touched upon 
under the Nineteenth and Twentieth Constitutional Amendments.  
Therefore , its repeal is a nullity in the eyes of law.  In this view of the 
matter , section 1 3 of the Act, being contrary to Article 204(3) of the 
Constitution is void ab initio.   
94.  Mr. Rashid A. Rizvi, ASC has argued that in enacting the 
COCA 2012 the Parliament has travelled beyond the mandate of the 
Constitution and the circumstances , in which the impugned legislation 
was enacted , make it a colo urable legislation , therefore, the same is 
liable to be declared void.  He has placed reliance on Mehr Zulfqar Ali Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  109 
Babu (PLD 1997 SC 11).  He has further argued that mala fides are not 
required to be proved in the case of colourable  legislation in the light 
of the law laid down in Shankara  Narayana ’s case  (supra ) and R. S. 
Joshi’s case  (supra ). The learned counsel for the Federation has also 
relied upon Shankara  Narayana ’s case  relied upon by Mr. Rashid A. 
Rizvi to contend that where the legislature is compet ent to enact a 
certain law, the enactment cannot be declared to be void on the 
ground of colourable legislation. He has also placed reliance on Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan’s case  to canvass the proposition that only such 
provisions of an enactment can be declared void as are found to be 
inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights as per mandate of Article 8 
of the Constitution and that the whole enactment cannot be declared 
void.   
95.  We have examined the case law cited at the bar. In K.C. 
Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Th e State of Orissa  (AIR 1953 SC 375) it has 
been held as under: -  
“It may be made clear at the outset that the doctrine of 
colourable legislation does not involve any question of 
bona fides or mala fides on the part of the legislature. The 
whole doctrine r esolves itself into the question of 
competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular 
law. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular 
law, the motives which impelled it to act are really 
irrelevant. On the other hand, if the legislatur e lacks 
competency, the question of motive does not arise at all. 
Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a 
question of power. A distinction, however, exists between 
a legislature which is legally omnipotent like the British 
Parliament an d the laws promulgated by which could not 
be challenged on the ground of incompetency, and a 
legislature which enjoys only a limited or a qualified 
jurisdiction. If the Constitution of a State distributes the 
legislative powers amongst different bodies, wh ich have to 
act within their respective spheres marked out by specific 
legislative entries, or if there are limitations on the 
legislative authority in the shape of fundamental rights, 
questions do arise as to whether the legislature in a 
particular case h as or has not, in respect to the subject -
matter of the statute or in the method of enacting it, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  110 
transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers. Such 
transgression may be patent, manifest or direct, but it may 
also be disguised, covert and indirect an d it is to this latter 
class of cases that the expression ‘colourable legislation’ 
has been applied in certain judicial pronouncements. The 
idea conveyed by the expression is that although 
apparently a legislature in passing a statute purported to 
act with in the limits of its powers, yet in substance and in 
reality it transgressed these powers, the transgression 
being veiled by what appears, on proper examination, to 
be a mere pretence or disguise. As was said by Duff, J. in 
Attorney -General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers, (1924 
AC 328 at p. 337).  
“Where the law making authority is of a limited or qualified 
character it may be necessary to examine with some 
strictness the substance of the legislation for the purpose 
of determining what is that the legisl ature is really doing.  
“In other words, it is the substance of the Act that is 
material and not merely the form or outward appearance, 
and if the subject -matter in substance is something which 
is beyond the powers of that legislature to legislate upon, 
the form in which the law is clothed would not save it from 
condemnation. The legislature cannot violate the 
constitutional prohibitions by employing an indirect 
method.”  
In G. Nageswara Rao v. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport 
Corporation  (AIR 1959 SC 308)  it has been held that: - 
“We have quoted the observations in extens o as they 
neatly summarise the law on the subject. The legal 
position may be briefly stated thus: The legislature can 
only make laws within it legislative competence. Its 
legislative field  may be circumscribed by specific legislative 
entries or limited by fundamental rights created by the 
Constitution. The legislature cannot over -step the field of 
its competency, directly or indirectly. The Court will 
scrutinize the law to ascertain whether  the legislature by 
device put -ports to make a law which, though in form 
appears to be within its sphere, in effect and substance, 
reaches beyond it. If, in fact, it has power to make the 
law, its motives in making the law are irrelevant.”  
 
In Jaora Sugar Mills’s case  (supra ) it has been held that: - 
“The challenge to the validity of a Statute on the ground 
that it is a colourable piece of legislation is often made 
under a disconnection as to what colourable legislation Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  111 
really means. As observed by Mukherje a J., in K. C. 
Gajapati Narayan Deo and Others v. The State of Orissa 
[1954] S.C.R. 1 at p. II, “the idea conveyed by the 
expression ‘colourable legislation’ is that although 
apparently a Legislature in passing a statute purported to 
act within the limits of its powers, yet in substance and in 
reality it transgressed these powers, the transgression 
being veiled by what appears, on proper examination, to 
be a mere presence or disguise.” This observation 
succinctly and effectively brings out the true characte r of 
the contention that any legislation is colourable legislation. 
Where a challenge is made on this round, what has to be 
proved to the satisfaction of the Court is that though the 
Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the 
Legislature in  question, in substance and in reality it 
covers a field which is outside its legislative competence. It 
would be noticed that as soon as this aspect of the matter 
is borne in mind, the argument that the Act is a colourable 
piece of legislation takes us ba ck again to the true scope 
and effect of the provisions of S. 3. If the true scope and 
effect of s. 3 is as Mr. Pathak assumes it to be, then, of 
course, the Act would be void on the round that it is a 
colourable piece of legislation. But if the true scope  and 
effect of s. 3 is as we have already held it to be, then in 
passing the Act, Parliament has exercised its undoubted 
legislative competence to provide for the recovery of the 
specified cesses and commissions in the respective State 
areas from the dates  and in the manner indicated by it. 
When demands were made for the recovery of the said 
cesses, they will be deemed to have been made not in 
pursuance of the State Acts but in pursuance of the 
provisions of the Act itself. Therefore, we do not think 
there is any substance in the argument that the Act is 
invalid on the ground that it is a colourable piece of 
legislation.”  
 
In B.R. Shankaranarayana ’s case  (supra ) it has been held that: -  
“As pointed out by this Court in Gajapati Narayan Deo's 
case, the whole  doctrine of colourable legislation resolves 
itself into the question of competency of a particular 
legislature to enact a particular law. If the legislature is 
competent to pass the particular law, the motives which 
impel it to pass the law are really irr elevant. It is open to 
the Court to scrutinize the law to ascertain whether the 
legislature by device, purports to make a law which, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  112 
though in form appears to be within its sphere, in effect 
and substance, reaches beyond it.”  
 
In Ashok Kumar Alias Golu v. Union of India [(1991) 3 SCC 498] it has 
been held that: -  
“It is only when a legislature which has no power to 
legislate frames a legislation so camouflaging it as to 
appear to be within its competence when it knows it is not, 
it can be said that the leg islation so enacted is colourable 
legislation. … … the whole doctrine resolves itself into a 
question of competency of the concerned legislature to 
enact the impugned legislation. If the legislature has 
transgressed the limits of its powers and if such 
transgression is indirect, covert or disguised, such a 
legislation is described as colourable in legal parlance. The 
idea conveyed by the use of the said expression is that 
although apparently a legislature in passing the statute 
purported to act within the l imits of its powers, it had in 
substance and reality transgressed its powers, the 
transgression being veiled by what appears on close 
scrutiny to be a mere pretence or disguise. In other words 
if in pith and substance the legislation does not belong to 
the subject falling within the limits of its power but is 
outside it, the mere form of the legislation will not be 
determinate of the legislative competence.”  
 
96.  From the above discussion in the case law, following 
principles are deduced:  -  
(a) The whole doct rine resolves itself into the question of 
competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular 
law. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular 
law, the motives which impelled it to act are really 
irrelevant.  
(b) In other words, it is the subs tance of the Act that is 
material and not merely the form or outward appearance, 
and if the subject -matter in substance is something which 
is beyond the powers of that legislature to legislate upon, 
the form in which the law is clothed would not save it fr om 
condemnation.  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  113 
(c) The legislature can only make laws within it legislative 
competence. Its legislative field may be circumscribed by 
specific legislative entries or limited by fundamental rights 
created by the Constitution.  
(d) The idea conveyed by the expres sion ‘colourable 
legislation’ is that although apparently a Legislature in 
passing a statute purported to act within the limits of its 
powers, yet in substance and in reality it transgressed 
these powers, the transgression being veiled by what 
appears, on proper examination, to be a mere presence or 
disguise.  
(e) Where a challenge is made on this round, what has to be 
proved to the satisfaction of the Court is that though the 
Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the 
Legislature in question, in  substance and in reality it 
covers a field which is outside its legislative competence.  
(f) The whole doctrine of colourable legislation resolves itself 
into the question of competency of a particular legislature 
to enact a particular law. If the legislature  is competent to 
pass the particular law, the motives which impel it to pass 
the law are really irrelevant.  
(g) It is only when a legislature which has no power to 
legislate frames a legislation so camouflaging it as to 
appear to be within its competence when  it knows it is not, 
it can be said that the legislation so enacted is colourable 
legislation.  
(h) If in pith and substance the legislation does not belong to 
the subject falling within the limits of its power but is 
outside it, the mere form of the legislati on will not be 
determinate of the legislative competence.  
 
Examined o n the touchstone of the above principles, the COCA 2012  is 
a colourable legislation  as it was beyond the legislative competence of 
the Parliament , and accordingly unconstitutional and voi d.  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  114 
97.  The next important aspect of the case relates to the 
doctrine of severability , which has been expounded in the case 
Attorney -General for Alberta  (supra) in the following terms : -  
“The real question is whether what remains is so 
inextricably bound  up with the part declared invalid that 
what remains cannot independently survive or, as it has 
sometimes been put, weather on a fair review of the whole 
matter it can be assumed that the Legislature would have 
enacted what survives without enacting the pa rt that is 
ultra vires at all.”  
 
Based on the above  principle , Mr. A.K. Brohi  (late) , a prominent jurist,  
in his book captioned “Fundamental Law of Pakistan” at page … has 
concluded as under : -   
“In each case, therefore, it is a question  for argument 
whether or not upon the Court coming to the conclusion 
that certain portions of the Act are beyond the law -making 
powers of the Legislature, the whole of the Act will be 
declared void. The test laid down by their lordships of the 
Privy Council, in any case is  not easy to apply, but that it is 
the only test that can be applied, appears to be a matter 
beyond dispute.”  
 
At page 266 of the aforesaid book, the following rules of construction 
laid down by the American Courts in cases where the question of 
severabil ity has been the subject of their consideration, as 
summarized by the Indian Supreme Court in  R.M.D.C. v. Union of 
India (AIR 1957 SC 628) are given: -  
(1)  In determining whether the valid parts of a statute are 
separable from the invalid parts thereof, it is t he intention 
of the legislature that is the determining factor . The test to 
be applied is whether the legislature would have enacted 
the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute 
was invalid.    
(2)  If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed 
up that they cannot be separated from one another , then 
the invalidity of a portion must result in the invalidity of 
the Act in its entirety. On the other hand, if they are so 
distinct and separate that after striking out what is invalid , 
what remains in itself a complete code independent of the 
rest, then it will be upheld notwithstanding that the rest 
has become unenforceable.  
(3)  Even when the provisions which are valid, are distinct and 
separate from those which are invalid i f they form part of a Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  115 
single scheme which is intended to be operative as a 
whole, then also the invalidity of a part will result in the 
failure of the whole.  
(4)  Likewise when the valid and invalid parts of a Statute are 
independent and do not form part of a Scheme but what is 
left after omitting the invalid portion is so thin and 
truncated as to be in substance different from what it was 
when it emerged out of legislature, then also it will be 
rejected in its entirety.  
(5)  The severability of the valid  and invalid provisions of a 
Statute does not depend on whether provisions are 
enacted in same section or different section, it is not the 
form but the substance of the matter that is material and 
that has to be ascertained on an examination of the Act as 
a whole and of the setting of the relevant provisions 
therein.   
(6)  If after the invalid portion is expunged from the Statute 
what remains cannot be enforced without making 
alterations and modifications therein, then the whole of it 
must be struck down a s void as otherwise it will amount to 
judicial legislation.  
(7)  In determining the legislative intent on the question of 
severability, it will be legitimate to take into account the 
history of legislation, its object, the title and preamble of 
it.  
 
Above principles are also described in the Shorter Constitution of 
India, 14th Edition, 2010, Vol. 2, p. 1706. Furthermore, i n the case of 
Motor General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh  (AIR 1984 SC 121), 
following propositions on the doctrine of severabilit y are laid down: -  
(1) The history, object, title and preamble of the Act shall 
have to be taken into consideration.  
(2) The remaining statute, after removing the invalid and 
inconsistent  portions from it, must give full meaning 
without any alterations. If any al terations are required to 
that remaining statute, then it must be struck down as a 
whole. The remaining portion  shall also not to be taken 
into account.  
(3) The form is not material.   The substance is material.  
(4) The question of severability has to be judged  on the 
intention of legislature. To ascertain the intention of the 
legislature the statement of the mover of the bill is no 
more admissible than a speech made on the floor of the 
house.  
(5) The part of an Act  can be held valid and another part 
invalid, if they are severable. If the offending provisions 
are so interwoven  into the scheme that they  are not 
severable, the whole is ultra vires  and void.  
(6) It is well settled  principle that the proceedings of the 
legislature cannot be called  in and for construing  a sect ion. 
  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  116 
98.  From a perusal of the above case law, i t is clear that the 
doctrine of severability permits a Court to sever the unconstitutional 
portion of a partially unconstitutional statute in order to preserve the 
operation of any uncontested or valid rem ainder, but  if the valid 
portion is so closely mixed up with the invalid portion that it cannot be 
separated without leaving an incomplete or more or less mixed 
remainder, the Court will declare the entire Act void.  In the instant 
case, t he provisions of sections 2(a), 3, 4(4) , 6(2) & (3), 8(1), (3) & 
(5), 10(b), 11(3) [first and second provisos], (4) & (5), 12 and 13 of 
COCA 2012 have been found unconstitutional and void on the 
touchstone of different provisions of the Constitution  discussed 
hereinabove, particularly Articles 2A, 4, 8, 9, 10A, 25, 175, 204, etc. 
Besides, the impugned Act has been held to be a colourable legislation , 
which was promulgated without legislative competence. Therefore, 
applying the doctrine of severability in view of the law lai d down in 
Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam  (supra) and Zaman Cement Co. (Pvt.) 
Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue  (2002 SCMR 312)  it is not possible to 
keep intact the impugned enactment and is to be struck down as a 
whole .   
99.  Mr. Abdul Shakoor P aracha, ASC for the Federation of 
Pakistan has challenged the maintainability of the instant petitions on 
the ground that the petitions do not meet the twin requirement of 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, viz., the involvement of 
a question of public import ance with reference to enforcement of any 
of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1, Part II of the 
Constitution. According to the learned counsel, these petitions have 
been filed merely on the basis of speculations and apprehensions 
whereas the pet itioners are required to specifically show the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  117 
infringement of any of their Fundamental Rights and mere 
apprehension about the violation of any of their rights does not entitle 
them to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3). The 
petitio ners are also required to establish that the matter is of public 
importance failing which their remedy may lie in invoking the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution. He 
has relied upon the cases of Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Shari f v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2004 SC 583) and Pakistan Muslim League 
(N) v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2007 SC 642).  
100.  The learned Attorney General for Pakistan also urged that 
these petitions are not maintainable under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution as no question of enforcement of Fundamental Rights of 
the petitioners is involved, none of the petitioners is directly 
aggrieved, therefore, they ought to approach the respective High 
Courts so that the aggrieved person may have the right of appe al 
before this Court under Article 185 (3) of the Constitution  against the 
judgments of the High Courts, and this Court is also benefited by the 
opinion of the High Courts on the issues determined therein. He has 
argued that jurisdiction under Article 184(3 ) cannot be exercised with 
the sole object of avoiding conflicting judgments that may be handed 
down by the High Courts because in such eventuality, the Supreme 
Court will be required to transfer to its file all cases pending in the 
High Courts on one point. He has argued that the entire case of the 
petitioners is that the new contempt law is going to adversely affect 
the independence of the judiciary, which is too sweeping a statement 
because the same law had remained in force for almost a quarter of a 
century, but nobody had ever come forward with the plea that the law 
of contempt was a clog on the independence of judiciary.  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  118 
101.  This Court has already dealt with the question of 
jurisdiction in a good number of cases . It is crystal clear from the 
languag e of Article 184(3) of the Constitution that it is not necessary 
that Fundamental Right of any particular individual is breached , rather 
the only requirement is that a question of public importance with 
reference to the enforcement of a Fundamental Right i s involved . The 
issue was considered by this Court i n Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 1988 SC 416), wherein the then Chief Justice made a 
classic statement that law is not a closed shop. Reference in this 
behalf may  also be made to the judgme nts of this Court In the matter 
of: Corruption in Hajj Arrangements in  2010 (PLD 2011 SC 963), 
Watan Party v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2011 SC 997)  and Bank of 
Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries (Pvt.) Ltd.  (PLD 201 0 SC 1109) . 
Relevant Para from the last mentioned judgment reads as under: -  
“25. A perusal of the above quoted provision would 
demonstrate that this Court was possessed of powers to 
make any order of the nature mentioned in Article  199 of 
the Constitution, if, in the opinion of this Court, a q uestion 
of public importance relating to the enforcement of any of 
the Fundamental Rights was involved in the matter . As has 
been mentioned in the preceding parts of this order, what 
was at stake was not only a colossal amount of 
money/property belonging t o at least one million 
depositors i.e. a large section of the public but what was 
reportedly at stake was also the very existence of the Bank 
of Punjab which could have sunk on account of the mega 
fraud in question and with which would have drowned not 
only the said one million depositors but even others 
dealing with the said Bank". And what had been sought 
from this Court was the protection and defence of the said 
public property. It was thus not only the righ t of this Court 
but in fact its  onerous obligat ion to intervene to defend the 
said assault on the said fundamental right to life and to 
property of the said public. ”   
 
In the instant case, petitioners have approached this Court under 
Article 184(3)  of the Constitution . The learned Attorney General has 
ignored the language of this provision, which is open ended and Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  119 
nowhere mandates that resort to Article 199 in the first instance is a 
pre-requisite. The exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court  under 
Article 184(3) is to be regulated by the Court it self in accordance with 
the Constitution an d the law as per its practice and procedure, and no 
hard and fast rule has ever been, or can be , laid down providing for 
the cases to be first entertained by the High Court under Article 199 
and the cases to be di rectly filed in the Supreme Court  under Article 
184(3) . The question as to which case is to be directly entertained by 
the Supreme Court is to be decided by the Court considering the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case . Therefore , the 
plea that the aggrieved party will have the right of appeal against the 
judgment of the High Court if the matter is first decided by the High 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution has no merit. Reference in 
this behalf may usefully be made to the cases of Manzoor Elahi v. 
Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1975 SC 66),  Darshan Masih v. State  (PLD 
1990 SC 513)  and Pakistan Lawyers’ Forum v. Pervez Musharraf  (2000 
SCMR 897).  
102.  The learned counsel for the Federation has argued that 
Fundamental Rights are clas sified into four categories, namely, 
freedom of speech (Article 19), property (Articles 23 & 24), equality 
(Article 25) and access to justice. But, there is no complaint of 
violation of Fundamental Rights covered in the three categories and 
the petitioner’ s case is that the COCA 2012 is violative of the 
Fundamental Right of equality enshrined in Article 25. According to the 
learned Attorney General, all these petitions, which have been filed on 
the ground of independence of judiciary and violation of Fundam ental 
Rights guaranteed by the Constitution, in essence, per se relate to 
violation of Fundamental Rights of freedom of speech as enshrined in Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  120 
Article 19 of the Constitution, and also its new recognition in the 
provisos to section 3 of the COCA 2012. He ha s vehemently contended 
that nobody has a Fundamental Right to have a particular contempt of 
Court law of his or her choice, even the Hon’ble Judges do not have 
that right. On the other hand, it is the right of all and sundry to 
possess freedom of speech, e xpression and thought, which is also 
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whereas the 
law of contempt is not so recognized under the said UN Declaration.  
103.  The learned Attorney General has also raised objection to 
the petition file d by the Bar Councils, particularly Pakistan Bar Council 
on the ground that it is not the function of the Bar Councils to file 
petitions and thereby cause the Judges to become Judges in their own 
cause because this way unfortunately the entire nation gets the 
message as if the Judges are becoming sensitive about the law, which 
concerns them. To substantiate his argument, he has read out the 
functions of the Bar Councils as laid down in section 13 of the Legal 
Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1976 and sta ted that filing of 
petitions does not fall within the role assigned to them under the Act. 
He then referred to clause (e) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the said 
Act, which the functions of a Provincial Bar Council shall be to promote 
and suggest law re form, but this provision too, according to the 
learned Attorney General would not enable a Provincial Bar Council to 
file petitions challenging the vires of any law.   
104.  We have considered the stance taken by the learned 
counsel for the Federation and the learned Attorney General. It may 
be observed that this is not the first time that petitions have been filed 
before this Court on behalf of Bar Associations, Bar Councils, 
representatives or members of the Bar on important constitutional Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  121 
matters. Refere nce here may be made to the case of Supreme Court 
Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 2002 SC 939) wherein 
the appointments of Judges of Supreme Court were challenged by the 
Supreme Court Bar Association through its President Mr. Hamid Khan, 
Pakistan Lawyers Forum through its President Mr. A.K. Dogar, Wattan 
Party through its President Mr. Zafarullah Khan, Barrister -at-Law, Rai 
Muhammad Nawaz Kharal, Advocate Supreme Court of Pakistan and 
Pakistan Bar Council through its Vice -President Mr. H. Sh akeel Ahmed 
by filing Constitution Petitions under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. 
After the pronouncement of judgment in the aforesaid case, a review 
petition was filed by Supreme Court Bar Association reported as PLD 
2003 SC 82 wherein it was observe d that the elected offices of the bar 
are sacred offices who have a role in promoting and advancing the 
system and the cause of the administration of justice in the country. In 
the recent past, Sindh High Court Bar Association filed petition 
challenging th e appointment of Judges of High Court of Sindh in the 
case reported as Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2009 SC 879), wherein the P rovisional Constitution 
Order, 2007  and other extra -constitutional measures of General Pervez 
Musharraf were declared as unconstitutional and void ab initio. 
Similarly, the validity of Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment was 
challenged, inter alia, by Supreme Court Bar Association, Lahore High 
Court Bar Association, Lahore High Court Bar Associatio n, Rawalpindi 
Bench, Pakistan Lawyers Forum as well as District Bar Association, 
Rawalpindi in the case reported as Nadeem Ahmad v. Federation of 
Pakistan  (PLD 2010 SC 1165). In President Balochistan High Court Bar 
Association  v. Federation of Pakistan  (2012 SCMR 897) , Constitution 
Petitions were filed on behalf of Balochistan High Court Bar Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  122 
Association  regarding abduction of persons by security agencies. In the 
instant case, as is mentioned in the title of the judgment, 
constitutionality of COCA 2012 has b een challenged, inter alia, on 
behalf of petitioners including Pakistan Bar Council through Chairman, 
Executive Committee  and others . Admittedly, the Pakistan Bar Council 
and Provincial Bar Councils, under the Legal Practitioners and Bar 
Councils Act (XXXV ) of 1973, enjoy statutory status as the highest 
bodies representing the legal fraternity in the Federation and the 
Provinces respectively. Their active interest in these petitions together 
with others mentioned above is a sign of vibrancy and vitality in 
society and rule of law and the Constitution. Article 5 of the 
Constitution provides that obedience to the Constitution and law is the 
inviolable obligation of every citizen. This Article casts an obligation on 
all persons to work for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule 
of law in the country. So, like all other natural persons, the legal 
entities also have a bounden duty to see that the Constitution is 
implemented and enforced . The bar bodies have never lagged behind 
in the cause of enforcement o f the Constitution and the rule of law. We 
were expecting Attorney General for Pakistan who is ex-officio  
Chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council to have appreciated the role and 
efforts of the Pakistan Bar Council for the rule of law , as the apex Bar 
Council  had earlier done in the appointment of Judges’ case in 2002 
and 2003. If a member of the civil society or an ordinary citizen is 
entitled to file a petition, then appearance of the bar associations and 
bar councils is most welcome. The argument of the lea rned Attorney 
General is without substance and is rejected.  
105.  It is to be noted that if Constitution is violated, every 
citizen has  a right to challenge the same. Reference may be made to Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  123 
the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 1996 SC 
324). Relevant paras therefrom read as under: -   
“12. Yet another objection raised was that the petitioner 
could not invoke Article. 184(3) of the Constitution as he 
has not been able to show whether any one, of his 
fundamental rights was infringed. To  this objection reply of 
the petitioner was that his fundamental right as enunciated 
under Article 18 of the Constitution, which relates to 
freedom of trade, business or profession and provides that 
subject to such qualifications, if any, as may be prescri bed 
by law, every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any 
lawful profession or occupation, and to conduct any lawful 
trade or business, is infringed. It is submitted by the 
petitioner that he is a practising lawyer and has a very 
vital interest in t he Judicial set -up which can function 
independently only when there is proper and total 
compliance of the Articles relating to the Judiciary and 
appointments are also made in accordance with the 
Constitutional scheme made thereunder. According to him, 
a lawyer cannot survive if the Judiciary is not independent. 
He has further submitted that he is governed by the Legal 
Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973 and the rules 
framed thereunder. He made reference to Rule 165 which 
provides that it is duty of adv ocates to endeavour to 
prevent political considerations from outweighing judicial 
fitness in the appointment and selection of Judges. They 
should protest earnestly and actively against the 
appointment or selection of person s who are unsuitable 
for the Ben ch. Petitioner also made reference to Rule 
175-A which provides that non -observance or violation of 
the cannons of professional conduct and etiquette 
mentioned in this chapter by an advocate shall be deemed 
to be professional misconduct making him liable f or 
disciplinary action. We find sufficient force in this 
contention. It appears that the remedies under Articles 
199 and 184 (3) available in a High Court and the 
Supreme Court respectively are concurrent in nature and 
question of locus standi is relevant in a High Court, but not 
in the Supreme Court when the jurisdiction is invoked 
under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. According to the 
petitioner, he went to the High Court and his writ petition 
was dismissed without deciding the questions of 
controvers y. He filed the petition for leave to appeal 
against the impugned judgment and also filed the direct 
petition under Article 184(3) of the, Constitution praying 
for examination of the Articles relating to the Judiciary and 
in that connection has called in q uestion some 
appointments in the Superior Judiciary. The learned 
Attorney General has submitted that since the controversy 
of the appointments challenged  by the petitioner before 
this Court has already been answered by the High Court in 
its judgment, thi s Court should refrain from going into the 
question of interpreting the Articles relating to the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  124 
Judiciary, which will be an exercise of academic nature and 
that if such an exercise is undertaken then there is every 
apprehension of breach of the Doctrine o f 'Trichotomy of 
Powers' in which it is very likely that this Court may go 
beyond the ambit of interpretation of the Constitution and 
may re -write the Constitution. He further submitted that 
the decision of the Supreme Court of India reported as AIR 
1991 S C 268 (Supreme Court Advocates -on-Record 
Association v. Union of India) should not be followed on 
the ground of judicial restraint.  
13. We are of the view that the petitioner has rightly 
invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3) 
of the Co nstitution and leave has rightly been granted in 
the other petition for the reason that in both the cases 
common question of interpretation of the Articles relating 
to the Judiciary are involved, which are of public 
importance. We are not impressed by the contention that 
interpretation of the Articles in these cases would be 
merely an exercise of academic nature. On the contrary, it 
can be said that this exercise has become very essential 
and necessary and would help a great deal in making the 
matters very clear by interpreting the relevant provisions 
of the Constitution relating to the Judiciary. It is held by 
this Court in the case of Fazlul Quader Chowdhry and 
others v. Muhammad Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486 that 
the interpretation of the Constitution is th e prerogative as 
well as the duty of the superior Courts as envisaged in the 
Constitution and this interpretative function cannot be a 
mere academic exercise without relation to concrete 
dispute, either between a subject and subject or between a 
subject an d the State. It is further held that cases of 
conflict between the supreme law of the Constitution and 
an enactment might come for adjudication before the 
Courts and in such cases, it would be plain duty of the 
superior Courts, as its preservers, protector s and 
defenders, to declare the enactment in question as invalid 
to the extent of its repugnancy with the Constitutional 
provisions. The power of judicial review therefore must exit 
in Courts of the country in order that they may be enabled 
to interpret th e Constitution in all its multifarious bearings 
on the life of the citizens in this country. It is also held that 
the Constitution ought to be interpreted as an organic 
whole giving due effect to its various parts . and trying to 
harmonise them, so as to m ake it an effective and 
efficacious instrument for the governance of the country. 
The above mentioned judgment is noticed in the case of 
the State v. Zia -ur-Rahman and others PLD 1973 SC 49 
and it is held that the Supreme Court is the creature of the 
Const itution and does not claim any right to strike down 
any provision of the Constitution, but does claim right to 
interpret the Constitution, even if a provision in the 
Constitution is a provision seeking to oust the jurisdiction 
of the Court. This right to i nterpret the Constitution is not 
acquired de hors the Constitution but by virtue of the fact Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  125 
that it is a superior Court set up by the Constitution itself. 
It is not necessary for this purpose to invoke any divine or 
super  -natural right but this judicial  power is inherent in 
the court itself - It flows from the fact that it is a 
Constitutional Court and it can only be taken away by 
abolishing the Court itself.  
14. In the case of Fauji Foundation v. Shami mur Rehman 
PLD. 1983 SC 456 distinction between "Judi cial Power" and 
"Jurisdiction" is made and it is held by this Court that in 
our Constitution the word used is "Jurisdiction" which 
denotes authority for the Courts to exercise the judicial 
power as such power is inherent in the superior Courts 
to-interpret , construe and apply law as a result of X 
system of division of powers. The "Judicial Power" is not 
constitutionalised in the Courts as in American 
Constitution, although the Courts in Pakistan traditionally 
exercise the jurisdiction over the matters thoug h not 
exclusive, which includes exercise of judicial power. ” 
Right of access to justice and i ndependen t judiciary is also one of the 
important rights of the citizens and if there is any threat to the 
independence of judiciary , it would be tantamount to den ial of access 
to justice, which undoubtedly is a fundamental right under Article 9 of 
the Constitution . Whenever there is  a violation of Articles 9 and 25 of 
the Constitution , it will  involve a question of public importance with 
reference to enforcement of  the Fundamental Rights of the citizens , 
who may approach  the Court for the enforcement of these rights under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution  without having  to discharge the 
burden of  locus standi .  
106.  As regards the contention of the learned counsel  for the 
Federation that the petitions do not raise a question of public 
importance with reference to enforcement of Fundamental Rights  
within the contemplation of Article 184(3) of the Constitution , it may 
be observed that Article 184(3) has received inte rpretation in a 
number of cases. In Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan  (PLD 
1988 SC 416), Mr. Justice Muhammad Haleem CJ, as he then was, 
observed that Article 184(3) does not say as to who shall have the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  126 
right to move the Supreme Court nor does it s ay by what proceedings 
the Supreme Court may be so moved or whether it is confined to the 
enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of an individual which are 
infracted or extends to the enforcement of the rights of a group or a 
class of persons whose rights a re violated. In this context , the 
question arises whether apart from the non -incorporation of sub 
Articles 1(a) and 1(c) of Article 199 the rigid notion of an “aggrieved 
person” is implicit in Article 184(3) as because of the traditional 
litigation which, of course, is of an adversary character where there is 
a lis between the two contending parties, one claiming relief against 
the other and the other resisting the claim. This rule of standing is an 
essential outgrowth of Anglo -Saxon jurisprudence in which the only 
person wronged can initiate proceedings of a judicial nature for redress 
against the wrongdoer. However, in contrast to it, this procedure is not 
followed in the civil law system in vogue in some countries. The 
rationale of this procedure is to li mit it to the parties concerned and to 
make the rule of law selective to give protection to the affluent or to 
serve in aid for maintaining the status quo of the vested interests. This 
is destructive of the rule of law, which is so worded in Article 4 of t he 
Constitution as to give protection to all citizens. The inquiry into law 
and life cannot be confined to the narrow limits of the rule of law in 
the context of constitutionalism which makes a greater demand on 
judicial functions. Therefore, while constru ing Article 184(3), the 
interpretative approach should not be ceremonious observance of the 
rules or usages of interpretation, but regard should be had to the 
object and the purpose for which this Article is enacted, that is, this 
interpretative approach m ust receive inspiration from the triad of 
provisions which saturate and invigorate the entire Constitution, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  127 
namely, the Objectives Resolution (Article 2A), the Fundamental 
Rights and the Directive Principles of State policy so as to achieve 
democracy, tole rance, equality and social justice according to Islam. 
The adversary procedure, where a person wronged is the main actor if 
it is rigidly followed for enforcing the Fundamental Rights, would 
become self -defeating as it will not then be available to provide  
“access to justice to all” as this right is not only an internationally 
recognized human right, but has also assumed constitutional 
importance as it provides a broad based remedy against the violation 
of human rights and also serves to promote socio -econo mic justice 
which is pivotal in advancing the national hopes and aspirations of the 
people permeating the Constitution and the basic values incorporated 
therein, one of which is social solidarity, i.e., national integration and 
social cohesion by creating an egalitarian society through a new legal 
order. It was further observed that this ideal can only be achieved 
under the rule of law by adopting the democratic way of life as 
ensured by Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy. Article 184(3) 
was furthe r interpreted by this Court in Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif 
v. President of Pakistan  (PLD 1993 SC 473), wherein the exposition of 
law made in Benazir Bhutto’s case  was affirmed and it was held that 
while construing Article 17 which guarantees fundamental rig ht, 
Court’s approach should not be narrow and pedantic but elastic 
enough to march with the changing times and guided by the object for 
which it was embodied in the Constitution as a fundamental right, and 
that its full import and meaning must be gathered from other 
provisions such as Preamble of the Constitution, Directive Principles of 
State Policy and the Objectives Resolution, which shed luster on the 
whole Constitution. This Court, in  a recent judgment In the matter of: Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  128 
Corruption in Hajj Arrangements in 2010 (PLD 2011 SC 963) has held 
that t he Supreme Court and High Courts, in exercise of the jurisdiction 
conferred upon them under Articles 184(3) and 199 of the Constitution 
respectively, are bound to protect and preserve the Constitution as 
well as to enforce Fundamental Rights conferred by the Constitution 
either individually or collectively. They are fully cognizant of their 
jurisdiction, which they exercise with judicial restraint. But such 
restraint cannot be exercised at the cost of rights of the c itizens if 
justice is denied to them. The scheme of the Constitution makes it 
obligatory on the superior Courts to interpret Constitution and law and 
enforce Fundamental Rights. The above parameters laid down from 
time to time have continued to regulate ex ercise of jurisdiction under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution.  
107.  The Courts are obliged to exercise their powers and 
jurisdiction to secure the rights of the citizens against arbitrary 
violations. While protecting and enforcing the Fundamental Right s of 
the people, the courts may also determine the legality of an executive 
action or a legislati ve act. It is too late in the day for the learned 
counsel for the Federation of Pakistan, or for that matter, the learned 
Attorney General to object to the mai ntainability of the petitions 
pressing into service the  rigid notion of an “aggrieved person” where 
the person wronged is the main actor  as being  implicit in Article 
184(3)  to call upon him to demonstrate the actual violation of any of 
their Fundamental Ri ghts. They must realize that inquiry into law and 
life makes a greater demand on judicial functions  and it would not be 
possible to close the doors of the Courts upon those who come forward 
to seek enforcement of the Constitution  [Benazir Bhutto’s case  
(supra)]. The Preamble (Objectives Resolution – Article 2A) Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  129 
acknowledges that the sovereignty over the entire Universe belongs to 
Almighty Allah alone, and the authority to be exercised by the people 
of Pakistan within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred  trust. 
Therefore, all persons acting in pursuance thereof are trustees. The 
people of Pakistan, acting through their representatives have framed 
the Constitution in the discharge of that trust. As rightly argued by Ch. 
Afrasiab Khan, ASC, it is not only a  social contract, but a trust deed, 
therefore, the trustees cannot go outside the trust nor can anyone of 
them claim absolute authority or sovereignty, be it in the legislative, 
executive or judicial sphere. The Constitution has defined the limit s of 
exerc ise of power, domain of operation and activities of various organs 
of the State and laid the foundations of a strong established 
democratic State of Pakistan. So, everybody is bound to act in 
accordance with the framework of the Constitution. The arguments  of 
the learned counsel for the Federation of Pakistan and the learned 
Attorney General, it appears, have just ignored the dictum laid down in 
the aforesaid cases.   
108.  The petitioners’ case is that they have approached this 
Court for the vindication of  their Fundamental Rights as enshrined in 
Articles 2A, 4, 9, 14, 19 & 25, as also the mandate of the Constitution 
contained in Articles 204 and 227  with the  that the impugned 
legislation runs contrary to the principle of independence of judiciary 
and also infringes the Fundamental Right of access to justice. The 
objection s raised by Mr. Abdul Shakoor Paracha , ASC for the 
Federation and the learned Attorney General to the maintainability of 
the petitions are without any merit , which are repelled and the 
petitions are held to be maintainable.  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  130 
109.  Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC has argued that in the event, the 
COCA 2012 is struck down, the Contempt of Court Ordinance, will be 
revived. We have examined this issue. After having found various 
provisions of COCA 2012 as ultra vires the Constitution, we are of the 
opinion that the remaining provisions of the impugned legislation, if 
allowed to stay on the statute book, would serve no purpose 
particularly, when it has been held that the repealing section (section 
13) its elf is a nullity, therefore, the principle of severability as applied 
by this Court in Mehram Ali  v. Federation Pakistan  (PLD 1998 SC 
1445)  and Dr. Mobashir Hassan’ case  is not attracted in the present 
case. Thus, having been left with no constitutional op tion, COCA 2012 
is declared unconstitutional, void and non est, as a consequence 
whereof, following the dictum laid down in Attorney -General for 
Alberta  (supra ), it is declared that the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 
2003 shall be deemed to have revived with  effect from 12.07.2012, 
the day when COCA 2012 was enforced with all consequences.   
110.  Above are the reasons for our short order dated 
03.08.2012  whereby the titled petitions were disposed of as under: -  
(i) The petitions are maintainable under Artic le 184(3) of the 
Constitution as questions of public importance with 
reference to enforcement of Fundamental Rights are 
involved therein;   
(ii) Under Article 204 read with Entry 55 of the Fourth 
Schedule to the Constitution, the High Courts and the 
Suprem e Court have powers to punish any person who is 
found guilty for the Contempt of Court falling within the 
definition of contempt of Court given in clause (2) of 
Article 204 of the Constitution;   
(iii) Section 2(a) of COCA 2012, which defines the word 
“Judge” as  including all officers acting in judicial capacity in 
administration of justice, is contrary to Article 204(1) of 
the Constitution as under the latter provision, the Court 
means the Supreme Court or a High Court;  
(iv) Section 3 of the COCA 2012 as a whole is void and 
contrary to Articles 4, 9, 25 & 204(2) of the Constitution 
for the reasons that –  
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  131 
(a) The acts of contempt liable to be punished 
mentioned in Article 204(2)(b) and some actions of 
contempt of Court falling under Article 204(2)(c) 
have been omitted fr om the definition of contempt of 
Court given in section 3 of COCA 2012;  
(b) COCA 2012 has been promulgated under clause 3 of 
Article 204 of the Constitution, which confers power 
on the legislature to make law to regulate the 
exercise of power by the Courts, a nd not to 
incorporate any substantive provision or defences as 
it has been done in the proviso;   
(c) Powers of the courts have been reduced by 
incorporating expression “by scandalizing a Judge in 
relation to his office” whereas in Article 204(2) the 
word ‘Cou rt’ has been used. Similarly, the definition 
provided by section 3 runs contrary to the provisions 
of Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution according to 
which, if a person has been convicted/sentenced for 
ridiculing the judiciary, he will be disqualified to  hold 
a pubic office, and in section 3 this expression has 
been omitted and instead of institution of judiciary, 
scandalization of a Judge has been confined in 
relation to his office;   
(d) By enacting provisos (i) to (xi) to section 3, 
immunities/defences hav e been provided, whereas 
no such provision exists in the Constitution; and  
(e) The proviso (i) to section 3, which grants exemption 
to the public office holders mentioned in Article 
248(1) from contempt of Court is violative of Article 
25 as under Article 204 (2), the Court is empowered 
to punish ‘any person’ for its contempt without any 
exception.  
 
(v) Incorporation of Article 248(1) in proviso (i) to section 3 is 
tantamount to amending the Constitution, which cannot be 
done without following the procedure laid d own in Articles 
238 and 239 of the Constitution;   
(vi) Article 248(1) has not granted immunity to any of the 
public office holders mentioned therein from any criminal 
proceedings, therefore, by means of proviso (i) to section 
3, no immunity can be granted to t he public office holders 
in violation of Article 25 of the Constitution;  
(vii) The terms and phrases used in provisos (i) to (xi) to 
section 3 are ambiguous and absurd and are meant to give 
benefit to contemners who have no respect for the 
judgments of the Cour ts, therefore, the said provisos being 
contrary to the principle of equality before law are void;  
(viii)  Under subsection (4) of section 4, the effect of earlier 
judgments has been nullified by pronouncing a legislative 
judgment without removing the basis on whi ch the 
judgments were pronounced, which is violative of the 
Fundamental Right of access to justice as enshrined in 
Article 9 and this provision also runs contrary to Article 
189 of the Constitution; therefore, this provision is void;   Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  132 
(ix) Section 6(2) is not sustainable because of declaration of 
section 3 void as a whole;   
(x) Section 6(3) encourages/promotes the commission of 
contempt of Court by postponing cognizance of a contempt 
of Court arising from an averment made in due course in 
appellate, revisional or review proceedings, till such 
proceedings have been finalized and no further appeal, 
revision or review lies, although to maintain the dignity 
and respect of the Court, prompt action to punish the 
contemner is called for. As any delay in this behalf would 
not only erode the dignity, but would also promote the 
tendency of disrespecting the courts and their orders, 
therefore, this provision being contrary to the principle of 
independence of judiciary and access to justice as 
enshrined in Articles 2A and 9 of the Constitution is void;   
(xi) Section 8 relating to transfer of proceedings is tantamount 
to curtailing the judicial powers. Subsection (1) of section 
8 is not sustainable because instead of the phrase 
‘scandalizing the Court’, expression ‘scandalizing a Jud ge 
in relation to his office’ has been used. This subsection also 
runs contrary to recognized principle of punishing any 
person who is guilty of contempt on the face of the Court 
where a prompt action to maintain the dignity of the court 
is called for;   
(xii) Transfer of proceedings form one Judge/Bench to another 
Judge/Bench is the prerogative of the Chief Justice being 
administrative head of his Court, which cannot be 
controlled by the legislature, therefore, subsection (3) of 
section 8 is violative of the pri nciple of independence of 
judiciary;  
(xiii)  Under subsection (5) of section 8, legislature cannot 
exercise power of transferring a case from the file of Chief 
Justice to next Senior Judge as it would be against the 
independent functioning of the Court and legisl ative 
interference in this behalf is tantamount to undermining 
the authority of the Chief Justice and other Judges as well. 
As such, this provision too is not sustainable;  
(xiv)  Section 10(b) is violative of Fundamental Right of freedom 
of speech and expression  enshrined in Article 19, which is 
subject to a reasonable restriction, inter alia , in relation to 
contempt of Court and Article 68 of the Constitution, which 
provides that no discussion shall take place in Parliament 
with respect to conduct of a Judge of the Supreme Court or 
a High Court;   
(xv)  Section 11(3) relating to filing of intra -court appeal against 
issuance of show case notice or an original order including 
an interim order passed by a Bench of the Supreme Court 
in any case, including a pending case to  a larger Bench 
consisting of all the remaining available Judges of the 
Supreme Court within the country is violative of the 
principle of expeditious disposal of the cases enshrined in 
Article 37(d) of the Constitution and the possibility of 
hearing of app eals by a larger Bench consisting of 
remaining Judges of the court within the country may 
render the proceedings ineffective as against each Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  133 
interlocutory order, appeals will be filed and there would 
be no end to the proceedings and in such a manner the 
dignity and independence of the Courts would be 
compromised;   
(xvi)  The first proviso to section 11(3) will render the whole 
proceedings of contempt of Court ineffective as at the 
initial stage after issuing a show cause notice, Full Court 
will have to be assembl ed to examine the grievance of the 
contemner if the show cause notice has been issued by 
half of the Judges whereas under the Supreme Court 
Rules, 1980, even very high profile cases may be decided 
by a two -member Bench;   
(xvii)  The second proviso to section 11(3 ), which provides for 
automatic suspension of a judicial order, is violative of the 
principle of trichotomy of power and the independence of 
judiciary. The passing of such an order is essentially a 
judicial function, which has to be performed by the Judges  
of the Supreme Court or the High Courts. The provision in 
question is contrary to settled principles governing the 
grant or refusal of an injunction/stay order. Thus, it being 
against the principle of independence of judiciary is not 
sustainable;  
(xviii)  The pro visions of subsections (4) and (5) of section 11, 
which prescribe limitation of 30 days for filing an appeal to 
a Bench of the High Court, 60 days for filing appeal to the 
Supreme Court, and filing of intra -court appeal or 
application for re -appraisal with in 30 days from the date of 
show cause notice or the order, as the case may be, are 
aimed at delaying decision of contempt cases and 
compromise the expeditious disposal of such cases to 
restore the dignity of the Courts, who are responsible for 
administrat ion of justice;   
(xix)  Section 12 of the Act is contrary to Article 204(3) of the 
Constitution, thus void ab initio;   
(xx)  By means of Article 270(AA), the Contempt of Court 
Ordinance, 2003, which was promulgated on 15.12.2003, 
continued in force till 12.07.2012, t he day on which COCA 
2012 was promulgated. In enacting section 13, which 
repeals COCA 1976, and the Ordinances of 2003 and 2004, 
no reason has been assigned for the repeal of the same;  
(xxi)  Subsection (2) of section 13 whereby COCA 1976, which 
already stood re pealed on 15.12.2003, has also been 
repealed along with Ordinances of 2003 and 2004 without 
spelling out logical reasons to promulgate COCA 2012, 
therefore, it is a nullity in the eyes of law;   
(xxii)  As per preamble of the legislation under scrutiny, it has 
been framed in exercise of the powers conferred by clause 
(3) of Article 204 of the Constitution, which provides that 
the exercise of the power conferred on a Court by this 
Article may be regulated by law and subject to law by rules 
made by the Court, but it does not mean that a statute can 
control or curtail the powers conferred on the superior 
Courts by the said Article, nor does it mean that in the 
absence of a statute on the above subject, the above 
Article would be inoperative; and  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  134 
(xxiii)  While enacting COCA 2 012 in pursuance of clause (3) of 
Article 204 read with Entry 55 of the Fourth Schedule to 
the Constitution, attempt has been made to reduce the 
powers of the Court as has been indicated in different 
provisions, thus, all such provisions are contrary to En try 
55 of the Constitution.   
 
17. After having found various provisions of COCA 2012 as 
ultra vires the Constitution, we are of the opinion that the 
remaining provisions of the impugned legislation, if allowed to 
stay on the statute book, would serve no p urpose particularly, 
when it has been held that repealing section itself is a nullity, 
therefore, the principle of severability as applied by this Court in 
Mehram Ali  v. Federation Pakistan  (PLD 1998 SC 1445)  and Dr. 
Mobashir Hassan’ case  is not attracted.  Thus, having been left 
with no constitutional option, COCA 2012 is declared 
unconstitutional, void and non est, as a consequence whereof, 
following the dictum laid down in Attorney General for Alberta v. 
Attorney -General for Canada  (AIR 1948 PC 194), it i s declared 
that the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 shall be deemed to 
have revived with effect from 12.07.2012, the day when COCA 
2012 was enforced with all consequences.

 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  135 
Jawwad S. Khawaja, J.   I have gone through the judgment of Hon’ble the Chief Justice 
and am in resp ectful agreement with the same. There is, however, one aspect of these 
petitions which is of the utmost importance to the law of contempt which I wish to 
highlight through this brief note.  
2. The aspect I advert to, is the distinction between contempt of c ourt through 
disobedience of a Court order (disobedience contempt) and contempt through 
scandalization of a Judge or Court. This distinction is well recognized in almost every 
common law jurisdiction, and has been accorded recognition in Article 204 of our  own 
Constitution. Thus sub -Article 2(a) empowers the Court “to punish any person who … 
obstructs  the process of the Court in any way or disobeys  any order of the Court” . Sub -Article 
2(b) on the other hand speaks of contempt where a person “scandalizes  the Court or 
otherwise does anything which tends to bring the Court or a Judge of the Court into hatred, 
ridicule or contempt”.  The distinction between disobedience contempt and contempt 
through scandalization is founded on sound doctrinal principles. The lea rned Attorney 
General, who repeatedly urged the Court to exercise judicial restraint, seems to have 
erred precisely because of ignoring this distinction. It is only when we take stock of the 
distintinction between the two types of contempt that we realize how misleading the 
argument for judicial restraint is.   
3. It is worth noting that most of the highly publicized legal contests which have of 
late come up before the Court fall in the category of disobedience contempt, not 
scandalization. According to fig ures obtained from the office of this Court, in the year 
2009, there were 131 contempt cases filed in Court. These all were cases where an order 
had been disobeyed and had nothing to do with scandalization of the Court or a Judge. 
In 2010, 129 of the total  130 contempt cases instituted pertained to disobedience and only 
one alleged scandalization. In 2011, of the 110 contempt cases instituted, only one case 
pertained to scandalization. In the current year there have been 77 contempt cases so far. 
Of these 2 0 are by petitioners who have sought contempt proceedings against 
individuals who allegedly have scandalized a Court or judge. Of these 77 cases only 3 
have been initiated by the Court itself and are yet to be decided. The most seminal 
contempt case recent ly decided by this court viz. Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani versus Assistant Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  136 
Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan  (2012 SCMR 424),  also pertained to disobedience of a 
Court order, a fact which the Court noted thus: “ The contempt proceedings arose out of non 
implementation  of the judgment of this Court. The cause is not of any member of the Bench but of 
the Court and in a wider sense of enforcement of the law .” Below, we will examine in some 
detail how this branch of contempt law emerged and why the constitution demands of 
us that it be dealt with sternly.   
 
DISOBEDIENCE CONTEMPT: HISTORICAL ORIGIN AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
SIGNIFICANCE.  
 
4. Historically, disobedience contempt emerged, essentially, as an enforecement 
mechanism, which the court found necessary for uphold ing the rule of law and for 
executing its orders. While today the law of contempt in this country finds its moorings 
firmly in the Constitution of Pakistan, it is nonetheless instructive to inquire into the 
historical origins of this power, particularly in  the English common law tradition which 
has had an influence upon our own but which has been significantly modified and 
clearly explicated in Pakistan through our Constitution and laws.  
5. It may be mentioned that in medieval England, the courts of the co mmon law 
had a limited range of common law remedies which could be granted to litigants. 
Parallel to the courts of the common law in England, there emerged another system for 
administering justice, headed by the Lord Chancellor of England. These courts are  
generally referred to as the courts of equity. It is these courts which initially evolved a 
range of effective remedies other than the few offered by common law courts. Among 
these remedies were directives and declarations which had to be complied with in 
personam,  i.e. by the person against whom these court orders were directed. It was to 
deal with those who were disobedient to the orders of the courts that the recourse by 
way of contempt of court was to be taken. In its most common form, this power is 
manifested today in Pakistan, in Order 39 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 which 
empowers a Court to order a person to be detained in prison if he is guilty of 
disobedience of a Court order. It should be clear, therefore, that the law of contempt in 
our pre sent context originated primarily, as a mechanism for enforcing court orders, and 
not as a tool for silencing dissenters or critics. The facts and figures cited above indicate Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  137 
that this original conception continues to hold the field. Disobedience contempt  (as 
opposed to scandalization contempt) remains the most important aspect of the law of 
contempt in our jurisdiction today. And this is so because of the constitutional 
imperative that every person and authority in Pakistan are duty bound to obey the 
Cons titution and the law. We have only recently reiterated this point in the judgment  
titled  Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani versus Assistant Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan  (2012 
SCMR 424) . Referr ing to “[the] timeless and prophetic principle of governance, enc apsulated 
in the well -known saying:
  (The leader of a people is their 
servant )”, it was held that “ [o]ur constitution  manifests the embodiment of this very principle 
when it obliges the highest executive functionary to carry out the commandments expressed by the 
people in the form of the constitution and the law. Deviations by fiduciaries from these 
commandments must remain of the gravest concern to citizens and courts alike.” In that 
judgment, the Court also referred to a hadith of the Holy Prophet (peace  be upon him), which 
expresses the spirit of equality enunciated by Islam which the Constitution refers to. The Holy 
Prophet (peace be upon him) urged  
 
Translation: O people, those before you were ruined because when someone of high rank among 
them (shar if) committed theft, they would spare him, but when a weak person from amongst them  
(zaeef) committed theft, they would inflict the prescribed punishment upon him .” (Sahih Bukhari).   
6. In law -abiding nations of the world, the power to punish contemnors ha s not 
only existed, but it has also been used whenever required to enforce Court Orders. 
World history is full of examples of persons, public figures of the highest standing 
amongst them, who were punished by courts for contempt. Professor Ronald Goldfard,  
in “The History of the Contempt Power” has masterfully narrated two famous instances. 
His narration of a case from medieval England can be gainfully reproduced here:  
“One can read of the escapades of ruddy Prince Hal, later to become Henry V of 
England, a nd his notorious brush with the law of contempt. When Hal was the 
Prince of Wales, one of his servants was arrested for committing a felony … the 
Prince appeared in a rage, and demanded that his man be let free. Chief Justice Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  138 
Gascoigne, delicately but firm ly ruled that the laws of the realm must be met …  
The Prince tried physically to take the servant away, whereupon Gascoigne ordered 
him again to behave. When the Prince raged … the judge reminded his prince that 
he kept the peace of the King … and suggest ed that Hal set a good example. When 
Hal did not heed this advice, he was sentenced for contempt , and committed to the 
King's Bench prison … People speculated whether this would be the end of 
Gascoigne's career. It developed that the King was pleased, and rejoiced that he had 
both a judge who dared to minister justice to his son,  and a son who obeyed him (if 
reluctantly) ”. 
 
7. This episode has been eloquently dealt with by Shakespeare in the following 
words: - 
Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:  
For which, I do commit into your hand  
The unstained sword that you have used to bear;  
With this remembrance, that you use the same  
With the like bold, just and impartial spirit  
As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand ” 
(Shakespeare’s Henry V, Part 2, A ct 5, Scene 2).  
 
8. Professor Goldfard also gives another example from the early years of the United 
Stated of America:  
“Major General Andrew Jackson, in command of the city of New Orleans in 1814, 
heard rumors that the state legislature was thinking of c apitulating to the British … 
Jackson was suspicious of the French volunteer troops who had been leaving the 
ranks. He ordered them out of the city. Lewis Louallier wrote an article in the local 
press critical of General Jackson's conduct. Jackson ordered h is arrest and 
imprisonment. Louallier then brought habeas corpus proceedings before Judge Hall of 
the district court. The judge granted his release. Jackson went into another rage, and 
arrested Hall. Then, United States Attorney Dick brought habeas corpus proceedings 
for release of Judge Hall, and it was granted. He joined Hall and Louallier in prison. 
After many judicial and political machinations all parties were released, and Jackson 
learned that the war was over. United States Attorney Dick then appeare d before 
Judge Hall and moved for General Jackson's punishment for contempt.  
Jackson, shifting tactics, and under the good advisement of his attorney, argued the 
inequities of contempt. He asserted that the summary power of contempt violated his 
rights un der the fifth and sixth amendments. He ingeniously argued that the 
necessity which allowed circumvention of constitutional privileges in contempt cases 
was a lesser one than the necessity which prompted his conduct. He had ordered Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  139 
martial law because it wa s necessary for the preservation of the whole country. 
Nonetheless  he was found guilty of contempt and fined $1,000.  It has been reported 
that the memory of this incident plagued Jackson until long after his later ascendency 
to the presidency. ”  
 
(Goldfard , Ronald. The History of the Contempt Power, Washington University 
Law Review, Vol: 1961, Issue: 1)  
 
We are reminded here, of our own recent history and the struggle of the people of 
Pakistan to uphold the Constitution and to enforce the rule of law. It is , therefore, 
unfortunate that instead of adhering to the Constitutiton, the Contempt Act was enacted 
in violation of the same.  
9. The above noted historical episodes highlight the significance of the power of the 
court to punish contemnors. Soceities whic h have attained the rule of law have done so 
at a price. And that price, we too must be prepared to pay. This historical context also 
makes it easier to understand why a people’s movement for the restoration of 
constitutional rule in Pakistan, which began with a defense of the constitutional 
protections for judicial independence, now seems to be culminating in a series of highly 
contested legal cases  revolving around the law of contempt. Some lament that this is an 
unfortunate trajectory. But, in the light of history, this trajectory seems only natural. In a 
government of laws, the courts of law are supposed to decide matters before them in 
accordance with the law. Once they have passed a judgment, the government of the day 
is required to implement it. But w hat happens if its functionaries do not do so? As stated 
earlier in the judgment, that, ultimately, is the question with which we are repeatedly 
being confronted whether through the executive’s non -compliance or through 
unconstitutional legislative action such as the impugned Contempt Act, 2012.   
10. In a previous judgment, we thoroughly examined our Constitution’s response to 
this question, which emerges through an interpretation of Articles 184(3), 187, 190 and 
204 and, in a limited category of cases, al so through Article 63(1)(g) too. The scheme 
which emerges from the Constitution runs, in short, like this: the Court, in and of itself, 
has to pass orders and to require  the imp lementation of its orders; responsibility  for 
implementation  has been made obli gatory on other organs of the state, primarily the Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  140 
Executive. However, in the unfortunate situation that a functionary of the Executive 
refuses to discharge his constitutional duty, the Court is empowered to punish him for 
contempt. Of course, this power o f punishing contemnors for disobedience is meant 
more to be a deterrent than a weapon of aggression. Generally, in a country where the 
rule of law prevails, a situation of this sort should never arise. And even when it does 
arise, a contemnor, once fully a pprised of the imminent consequences of his 
disobedience, would purge himself of contempt through compliance. Yet, in periods 
where the supremacy of the constitution is contested as the dominant ethos of 
government, it is not surprising that cases do arise  where a deterrent effect can be 
achieved only by an actual exercise of this power. In such cases, the Courts are in fact 
constitutionally obliged not to shy away from the inevitable. Simply put, a government 
of laws cannot be created or continued with too thless courts and defiant or blithely non -
compliant public functionaries.  
 
SCANDALIZATION CONTEMPT  
 
11. The Attorney General in his submissions repeatedly urged the Court to adopt 
judicial restraint. He also cited a number of precedents and texts  to emphas ize the 
notion of judicial restraint in contempt cases. We repeatedly requested him, and the 
other learned counsel to cite precedent from anywhere in the world where the courts 
exercised judicial restraint in the face of disobedience contempt. As stated ea rlier in the 
opinion, despite our repeated requests, no such precedent could be cited – perhaps, 
because there is none. All the precedents which wax lyrical about the benefits of judicial 
restraint are, in reality, cases where the issue was that of scandal ization. In cases of 
disobedience contempt, the approach is altogether different. In such cases, courts do not 
show restraint because at stake is the people’s right to the rule of law, not the ego of 
judges.  
12. When Lord Denning, the well known British j udge, made his oft -quoted speech 
in R v. Meteropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) , he too was sitting in judgment on a case 
of scandalization contempt, not of disobedience contempt. The learned Attorney General 
emphatically relied on this speech without ap preciating this distination. Lord Denning Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  141 
said: “ Let me say at once that we will never use this jurisdiction (contempt) as a means to uphold 
our own dignity. That must rest on surer foundations. Nor will we use it to suppress those who 
speak against us. We  do not fear criticism, nor do we resent it. For there is something far more 
important at stake. It is no less than freedom of speech itself “ . (R v. Meteropolitan Police 
Commissioner, ex parte Blackburn  (No.2) [1968] 2 QB 150 at 154)  
13. We cannot agree w ith him more. Our constitutional jurisprudence has followed 
the concept of contempt law relating to scandalization as expounded by Lord Denning. 
In this context, the judgment of this Court in the case titled Syed Masroor Ahsan and others 
versus Ardeshir Co wasjee and others  (PLD 1998 SC 823, 1124) can be gainfully cited 
wherein, amongst other precedents, R v. Meteropolitan was quoted, and it was observed 
that “ the Pakistani nation should learn tolerance and inculcate the haibit of appreciating the 
opposite p oint of view. Furthermore, our approach should …  be oriented with the object to 
promote Isalmic, social and political justice … which cannot be attained unless we strive to 
strengthen the institutions including the Judiciary. ” Barring instances of deliber ate, 
egregious or malicious utterances, this Court has never been intolerant of critics. All we 
demand of those who criticize us is what Lord Denning also sought: “ … remember that, 
from the nature of our office, we cannot reply to their criticisms. We cann ot enter into public 
controversy. Still less into political controversy. ” (R v. Meteropolitan, supra ) 
14. As elaborated in the judgment of Hon’ble the Chief Justice, the Contempt Act 
2012 creates impermissible and unconstitutional exceptions to protect a c ertain category 
of persons from contempt for violating Court orders which they are obliged by the 
Constitution to obey and enforce. In the context of the foregoing discussion, it become s 
clear  why this could be such a dangerous  and unconstitutional  proposi tion. This is why 
the Court has no option but to strike it down the impugned Contempt Act, 2012.  
 
 
(Jawwad S. Khawaja)  
Judge  
 
 
 
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  142 
 
Khilji Arif Hussain, J.  I have had the privilege to go through the opinion 
recorded by Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan and b y my learned brother 
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja. Apparently nothing is left to 
add on my part as all aspects of the matter have been dealt with by my 
learned brothers in their opinions. However, with great humility at my 
command, I would like to  add few lines to deal briefly with the question 
of Legislative Power of the Parliament in democratic system governed by 
written Constitution and Power s of Judicial Review of the Court s.     
 
LEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT  
2.  The Constitution is an organic law which defines the 
structure, powers and functions of the three organs of the State i.e. 
Executive, Legislature and Judiciary, there relationship inter se, for limit 
for such powers and functions and also the relationship between the 
citizens an d the Government.  
3.  Every modern democratic Constitution are entrusted public 
welfare functions to the Government established by it, wherein the 
Government becomes the trustee of the people who are beneficiaries. 
Thus, in every modern democratic state, the Government is the trustee 
that cannot act or exercise power s against the interest of its beneficiaries 
(people).  
 
4.  Article 2(A) of the Constitution specifically provided that the 
sovereignty belongs  to Almighty Allah and the delegated authority to be 
exercised by the people of Pakistan within the limits described by Him, is 
a secret trust whereas it is the will of the people of Pakistan to establish 
an order, wherein the State shall exercise its powers and authority 
through the chosen representative s of the people.         
 Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  143 
5.  In the administration of Justice in a true democratic state, it 
is in the courts and not in the legislature that the citizens of such a state 
primarily feel the keen, cutting edge of the law. It means that the actual 
law, be i t enacted or customary, is what the courts interpret and finally 
enforce. This is the power/function th rough which the judiciary can 
enforce the rule of law. Therefore, there is absolute need to respect the 
decisions of the courts. Mr. Justice Arthur T. Va nderbilt has aptly and 
ably remarked; “It is in the courts and not in the legislature that our 
citizens primarily feel the keen, cutting edge of the law. If they have 
respect for the work of the courts, their respect for law will survive the 
shortcomings o f every other branch of government; but if they lose their 
respect for the work of the courts, their respect for law and order will 
vanish with it to the great detriment of society”  
6.  Further, it is almost universally acknowledged that one of 
the most f undamental aspects of the protection of human rights is the 
creation of a strong indigenous legal system and the maintenance of an 
independent judiciary. The establishment of a strong legal system and an 
independent judiciary may sound somewhat pedestrian.  It is, however, 
only through the creation of a strong legal system that human rights can 
be enforced. The system of enforcement of human rights will only operate 
effectively if Judges can determine disputes between individuals and the 
State in the absence  of the State’s influence. For example, judicial 
independence has been defined variously as: “ the degree to which judges 
actually decide cases in accordance with their own determinations of the 
evidence the law and justice free from coercion, blandishments , 
interference, or threats from governmental authorities or private citizens” 
In modern democracy, be it presidential or parliamentary, the 
importance of the independence of the judiciary cannot be minimized  
and neglected because there can be no democracy  without basic human Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  144 
rights and fundamental freedoms as its foundation and there can be no 
protection and enforcement of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
without the existence of an independent judiciary.  
 
7.  Democracy, development and respect for h uman rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. 
Democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to 
determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and 
their full participation in all aspe cts of their lives. In the context of the 
above, the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms at the national and international levels should be universal and 
conducted without conditions attached.  
 In the case of Director of Publ ic Prosecutions of Jamaica versus 
Mollison,  (2003) 2 AC 411, it was held that the independence of the 
judiciary is a ‘constitutional fundamental’ and cannot be trespassed 
upon by other branches of government.   
 In the case of R. Anufrijeva versus Secretar y of State for the 
Home Department, (2003) UKHL 36, the House of Lords held that the 
executive c annot make unilateral determinations of people’s rights which 
bypassed the scrutiny of the courts. This right of ‘access to justice’ could 
also be considered a ‘fundamental’ constitutional principle.  
8.  The Parliament being duly elected representative of the 
people of Pakistan , which is to carry on the business of the Country 
make all policies , and political decision , is the only body to legislate with 
respect to any matter in the Federal Legislative List by originating bill in 
either of the House except Money Bill which has to originate in the 
National Assembly. The Parliament has exclusive power to make laws 
(including laws having extra -territorial operation) for the whole or any 
part of Pakistan, but only in respect of any matter enumerated in Federal Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  145 
Legislative List and not in contravention with the rights conferred by 
part-II of the Constitution or in conflict with any Articles  of the 
Constitution.  
9.  According to the theory of separation of powers, the function 
of the Legislature is to make law -Jus dare , that of the executive is to 
execute law and to dispense administrative functions Jus-dicere, and 
that of the judiciary is to interpret and apply the law -Jus-dicere. 
However, the countries governed by Federal written Constitution, the 
function of the Courts more particularly a Constitutional Court is not 
merely of jus -dicere being the guardian of the Constitution itself.  
10.  The Legislature even by law can  overcome the effect of any 
judgment of the Superior Courts and Court s uphold such legislation. If 
any reference is required one can see Article 31A of the Customs Act by 
which Legislature nullify the effect of the judgment of this Court in the 
case of Al-Samrez Enterprise versus The Federation of Pakistan,  
(1986 SCMR 1917) and such Legislation was upheld by the Superior 
Court.    
 
JUDICIAL REVIEW  
11.  The constitutionality of a law is to be presumed because the 
Legislature which was first required to pass upon the question, acting as 
they, must be deemed to have acted with integrity and with a just desire 
to keep within the restrictions laid down by the Constitution upon their 
action, have adjudged that it is so.  
12.  This Court in exceptional circumstance s can intervene and 
review the validity of Legislation which is perceived to be beyond the 
constitutional pale. The Constitution of Pakistan is written Constitution 
with a concept of separation of powers and no Organ of the State 
whether Executive, Legisla ture or Judiciary is supreme to one or other, Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  146 
supreme is only the Constitution which reflects the will of the people. It 
is not only the duty and obligation of the Courts to protect the 
Constitution but also of every citizen whether in Pakistan or not to 
protect it. If any of the provision of the Constitution is breached by any 
one including by Legislation, then it is the duty of the Judiciary to review 
the Legislation, if it cannot be construed in a manner consistent with 
Articles of the Constitution.  
 
13.  If we accept the proposition that the Judiciary may not 
question the validity of an Act of the Parliament even if it is against the 
Fundamental Rights, violative of any Article of the Constitution, then this 
obedience to statue will result in disobedien ce to the Constitution for the 
protection of which not only the Judges but also the Parliamentarians 
have taken Oath. 
14.  By Oath of office, as Judge, we have to protect the 
Constitution, which is the voice of the people of Pakistan. Like 
Constitution, Co urt is also colour blind and makes no difference between 
a person holding any office and an ordinary man, except where the 
Constitution itself made any such difference.    
15.  The Law of Contempt is not to punish a person by a Court 
under Article 204 of t he Constitution for Contempt of Court nor is for 
some personal ego of the Judges of the Superior Courts, but is to ensure 
the independence of Judiciary in terms of Article 194 read with Preamble 
and Article 2A of the Constitution and Entry 55 of the Federa l Legislative 
list which further limits the Legislative Power of the Parliament, in 
respect of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.    
16.  The Constitution maker s considers contempt of Court so 
serious that he has not left it to change by Legislat ure by simpl e majority  Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  147 
by defining what act constitute contempt.  Article 204 of the Constitution  
is  not  to  protect  the  ego  of  the  Judges  but  in fact it  
protects the right of public generally and specially of the litigant so that 
the right s given to t hem by Courts can be enforced.     
 
17.  The Constitution confers powers upon the Parliament to 
frame the law within the limits fixed by it and if any law framed by the 
Parliament is in conflict with the Constitution, the same is liable to be 
struck down. Article 24 of the Constitution puts restrictions on the 
Parliament to frame the law for acquiring the properties without 
compensation. Likewise prior to Eighteenth Amendment, the Parliament 
could frame law in respect of 59 entries mentioned in the Federal 
Legislative List and 47 entries in the Concurrent List, but after 
Eighteenth Amendment, the Parliament has no authority to frame the 
law in respect of any items which were earlier mentioned in the 
Concurrent List and any law if framed by the Parliament in respect of the 
matters not in the Federal Legislative List fall within the domain of the 
Provincial Legislation, the same can be struck down.  
18.  To conduct judicial review of a Statute, the Court must 
review the Statute in the light of exactly what the Constitution says, and 
state why each part of Statute is unconstitutional. This Court and the 
Courts in neighbouring Countries strike down the Legislation, as and 
when they come to the conclusion that same is in conflict with any 
provision of the Constitut ion.    
19.  The Constitution framer provided only in two Articles of the 
Constitution for taking action/cognizance.  
20.  Article 6 of the Constitution provide s that for the guilty of 
high treason the  Parliament shall by law provide for the punishment of  
persons found guilty, whereas, Article 204 of the Constitution provided Const. P. No. 77 of 2012  148 
that the Court shall have power to punish any person who did any act 
mentioned in the Clause (a) to (c) of the Article 204 (2) and by law and any 
other things not mentioned in Article  204(2) (a) to (c) can  be added as an 
act of  contempt of Court and the power to punish confer by Article 204(2) 
can be regulated by law, by rules made by the Court.  
21.  On scanning the Constitution, it appears that being 
cognizance of severances of the  matter and to ensure the independence of 
judiciary, the Constitutional framer provided for the punishment any 
person in term of Article 204 by the Court even if no regulation in this 
regards has been made by Legislation.   
22.  The question why the power was not conferred upon the 
Court to punish a person guilty of high treason as conferred in the case of 
contempt of Court, the wisdom of the Constitution framers appears to be 
that for creating an independent organ within the frame of the 
Constitution and t o secure independence of judiciary which is dominant 
intent and spirit of the Constitution, in case of any act of contempt 
mentioned in Article 204(a) to (c) the Court can punish any person being 
guilty of contempt,  instead leaving the matter at the mercy of the 
legislature to frame the law. Whereas high treason being a serious crime 
against the society, the Constitution framers in their wisdom decided that 
it is for the Legislature to frame to law to take cognizance  against such 
persons.    
  With these few words, I concur with the opinion recorded by 
my learned brothers.
