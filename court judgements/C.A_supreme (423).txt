ORDER  
Qazi Faez Isa, CJ. These appeals pertain to the disqualification of 
candidates who wanted to contest elections.  In Civil Appeals No.981 and 
985 of 2018 the parties are the sam e; one appeal is with regard to a 
Provincial Assembly seat and the other to a National Assembly s eat. In 
Civil Appeal No.984 /2018 the parties are different but the issue is the 
same. The general elections of 2008 require d candidates t o have a 
minimum gradu ation qualification. Some  candidates made misdeclarati ons 
in their requisite nomination papers, some produced degrees from 
unrecognized institutions and other s fake degrees to show eligibility of  
their participation in the general elections. This court had disqualified all 
such candidates and some also faced criminal prosecution. The respondent 
No.1 in Civil Appeals No.981 and 985 of 2018 was convicted for a period of 
two years , and we are informed that his appeal against conviction is 
pending before the Mu ltan Bench of the Lahore High  Court , however,  for CAs-981, 984 and 985 of 2018.doc  2
the person who purportedly produced a fake degree in Civil Appeal No.984 
of 2018 there was no criminal prosecution. In view of the fact that a 
criminal  appeal is pending adjudication before  the Lahore  High Court , we 
steered clear o f this aspect and only concern  ourselves with the question of 
disqualification  of candidates.  
2.  The learned counsel for the appellants states that  disqualification is 
for life by relying on the decision in the case of Sami Ullah  Baloch v Abdul 
Karim Nausherwani  (PLD 201 8 Supreme Court 405) which held that when  
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(‘the Constitution ’) is attracted, the disqualification is for life. However , 
the learned cou nsel for the respondent in Civil Appeal No.981 and 985 of 
2018 disputes this and states that the period of disqualification  is for five 
years as per section 232(2) of the Election s Act, 2017 , which  provision  was 
enacted through the Election s (Amendment) Ac t, 2023 , promulgated on 26 
June 2023.  The learned Additional Attorney General  (‘AAG’) also relies on 
the said statutory provision , reproduced hereunder:  
‘232(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other provisions of this  Act, and other law for 
the time being in force and judgment, order or 
decree of  any court, including the Supreme Court 
and a High Court, the disqualification of  a person 
to be elected,  chosen or to remain as a member of 
the Majlis -e-Shoora  (Parliament) or a Provincial 
Assembly under  paragraph (f) of clause (1) of  
Article 62 of the Constitution shall be for a period 
not exceeding five years from  the declaration by 
the court of law in tha t regard and such 
declaration shall be  subject to the due process of 
law.’ 
 
3. We inquired from the  learned counsel whether section 232(2) of the 
Election s Acts, 2017 has been challenged and they said that t hey are not 
aware of a challenge  thereto . However, the learned counsel are unanimous  
in stating that unless there is a clear pronouncement by this C ourt on the 
matter the returning officer s in the forthcoming general electio ns may 
wonder whether to apply section 232(2)  of the Elections A ct, 2017,  or the 
said judgment of this Court , which may create needless confusion in the 
election s and shall not be conducive to democracy. There is also the 
likelihood of  election tribunal s and courts being  inundated with cases 
arising out of the uncertainty.  
4. The learned AAG points out that the Supreme Court (Practice and 
Procedure) Act, 2023 (‘the Act ’) requires th at where  constitutional CAs-981, 984 and 985 of 2018.doc  3
interpretation is required  a Bench of a  minimum of five Judges  has to  hear 
it. He further state s that the interpretation of a Federal law,  the 
Constitution  and applicability of the decision of the Supreme Court  is 
require d, which will also impact elections to the provincial assemblies , and 
as such requisite notices be issued . Therefore, notices under Order XXVII -
A of the Code of Civil Pro cedure , 1908  be issued to the Attorney -General 
for Pakistan and to all the Advocate Generals  of the provinces . Notice be 
also issued to the Election Commission of Pakistan and public notice  be 
published in a prominent English and Urdu newspap er having  wide 
circulation  as the decision in these appeals may also affect those who are 
not parties her eto.  
5. Concise statement s attending to the said constitutional and legal 
questions , without reference to facts and the particulars of individual  cases 
may be filed . It is clarified that the pendency of th ese appeals and the 
questions raised herein shall not be  used as a pretext to delay the 
forthcoming general elections  scheduled to be held on 8 February 2024 .  
6. These cases, and any others involving the same questi on, be fixed for 
hearing in early January, 2024 before a Bench constituted by the 
Committee unde r the Act.
