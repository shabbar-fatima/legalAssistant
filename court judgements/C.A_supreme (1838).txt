ORDER  
 
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.-  Through leave of 
the Court, i mpugned herein is judgment dated 4.11.2013 , whereby 
a learned Judge -in-Chambers of Peshawar High Court proceeded 
to quash  First Information Report No.5 dated 6.11.2011  registered 
with Police Station Anti -Corruption Establishment, Charsada . The 
controversy revolves around a dispute over immovable property; it 
was set off by Javed Khan, appellant being attorney of the owner .  
Learned Additional Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  is in a 
unison with the appellant to maintain that there was hardly an 
occasion  for the learned Judge to quash the First Information 
Report structured upon allegations/evidence that warranted 
investigative as well as judicial scrutiny . Learned counsel for the 
respondent has not faced the appellant or the learned Law Officer  
with much enthusiasm and instead prays for opportunity to re -
agitate the plea before appropriate forums at the relevant time .  Criminal Appeal No.11 -P/2014  
 2
  Criminal appeal is allowed, impugned judgment dated 
4.11.2013 by the learned Judge -in-Chambers is set aside , while 
keeping respondents’ option s wide open to re -agitate their plea, if 
so advise d; bail granted to them shall hold field.
