ORD ER
 
  Mr. Muhammad Munir Paracha, the learned counsel 
who appeared on behalf of the Election Commission of Pakistan, 
has furnished details of all the steps being taken for arranging 
free and fair election, and in this respect, a request has been made 
to the Government of Pakistan for legislation. He has stated that 
out of the same, one relates to the amendment in Section 104 of 
the Representation of the People Act, 1996 (ROPA ), by insertion 
of Section 104B. The proposed provision  reads as follows:  
“25. Inser tion of section 104B, Act LXXXV 
of 1976. - In the said Act, after section 104A, 
inserted as aforesaid, the following new section 
shall be inserted, namely,  
 
“104B.  Monitoring of election 
campaign, etc. (1) The Commission 
shall appoint teams of monitors 
consisting of such number of 
members as may be determined by 
the Commission, for a constituency 
or a group of constituencies which 
shall monitor election campaign of 
the candidates and shall report in 
the format approved by the 
Commission violations of the cod e 
of conduct on daily basis, if any, by 
the candidates, to the District 
Returning Officer.  
 
(2) The District Returning 
Officer, on receipt of reports 
mentioned in sub -rule (1), shall 
proceed in accordance with the CMA.64/2013, etc.  3 
provisions of Section 86B(1) of the 
Act.”  
 
 
But the Government of Pakistan has shown reservations in 
making the said amendment.  
2.  Mr. Bilal Hassan Minto, learned counsel for the 
petitioner pointed out that in substance the above amendment 
relates to one of the observation of this Court in the ca se of 
Workers’ Party Pakistan through Akhtar Hussain, Advocate, 
General Secretary and 6 others v. Federation of Pakistan and 2 
others  (PLD 2012 SC 681). He had made reference to an extent 
there from, which is reproduced herein below:  
 (b) The Election Comm ission is 
empowered to check not just illegal actions 
relating to the election (violating the limits 
set for campaign finance, etc.) or corrupt 
practices (bribery, etc.), but is also 
empowered to review all election activities, 
including Jalsas, Jaloos , us e of 
loudspeakers, etc. for their effects on the 
standards of ‘fairness, justness and honesty’ 
that elections are expected to meet. The 
Election Commission is also empowered to 
take pre -emptive measures to ensure that 
the spirit of democracy and ‘fairness,  
justness and honesty’ of elections is fully 
observed. The Election Commission is, 
therefore, directed to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the same;.”   
 
3.  Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC the counsel for one 
of the political part ies i.e. PTI, while addr essing the Court and CMA.64/2013, etc.  4 
supporting the application  of Article 218(3)  of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, contended that the 
Election Commission is charged with making arrangements as 
are necessary to ensure that the election is cond ucted honestly, 
justly, freely and in accordance with law and that corrupt 
practices are guarded against, therefore, while making such 
arrangements , monitoring of the election campaign, etc., as it 
has been proposed in Section 104B of the ROPA, 1976 , is mo st 
vital by any standard as this mechanism shall empower the 
Election Commission to arrange the elections to achieve the 
objects in terms of Article 218(3)  of the Constitution , 
particularly, to guard against corrupt practices . The amendment 
so being sought  is already part of the judgment as noted 
hereinabove and it has a binding force on all concerned, 
including the candidates, voters and the citizens who all are 
interested in ensuring that the country is governed by the chosen 
representatives and it is the  requirement of the day that such 
chosen representatives must be elected by holding a free and fair 
election and such representatives should not suffer from any kind 
of corruption nor they should adopt any corrupt measures  during 
the proces s of election. T herefore, to guard against such corrupt 
practices the Government of Pakistan should  have no objection in CMA.64/2013, etc.  5 
this behalf as it is the requirement of the Constitution, as noted 
herein above.  
4.  Learned Deputy Attorney General appear ed on behalf 
of the Governm ent of Pakistan but without making any 
comments. We would like to have the view point of the learned 
Deputy Attorney General, who stated that as he could not seek 
instructions regarding the order dated 12.03.2013 as copy of the 
said order was received by h im late.  
5.  We have also directed on 12.03.2013 that the learned 
counsel for the parties to file details of the measures in respect of 
which the Election Commission has sought amendment and the 
reaction of the Government thereto in order to resolve the 
difficulties, if any, and also to examine as to whether there is any 
interest at all in the implementation of the judgment noted herein 
above. However, details have been submitted by the Election 
Commission of Pakistan but the learned counsel is directed tha t 
he should obtain further instructions from by the Election 
Commission.  
6.  Learned counsel appearing for the Election 
Commission is directed to bifurcate these details firstly showing 
the portion which is to be implemented in pursuance of the 
directions  of this Court in the judgment noted herein above, and CMA.64/2013, etc.  6 
for which no legislation is called for. Secondly with a separate 
portion in respect of those directions, observations and 
improvements that the Election Commission on its own intends 
to achieve the obj ective under Article 218(3) of the Constitution, 
so that the matter could be resolved. This exercise must be 
carried out as early as possible. On receipt of the reply and after 
hearing the parties’ counsel further appropriate orders shall be 
passed in this  behalf, as the general elections are around the 
corner. Therefore, there should be no delay by any corner and 
they should do the needful as is required to be done under the 
Constitution and the law as early as could be possible in the 
greater national int erest.
