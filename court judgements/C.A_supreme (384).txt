JUDGMENT  
 
Civil Appeals No. 805 & 1438 to 1445 of 2017 and  
Civil Petitions No.3446 & 3447 of 2016 : 
 
  Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The Prime Minister in his 
speech to the nation on 23.2.1997 announced adhoc relief for the 
government employees including an increase of Rs.300/ - per 
month in their salaries w.e.f. 01.03.1997 and an increase in the 
pension by 10% (ten percent) . This announ cement was officialized 
through Office Memoranda Nos. F.1(17) Imp./97 and Nos.F.4(3) -
Reg.6/97 dated 5.0 3.1997 and 11.3.1997 respectively, issued by 
the Finance Division (Regulations Wing), Government of Pakistan, 
while clarificatory Office Memorandum Nos. F.4(3) -Reg.6/97 dated 
29.3.1997 issued by the Finance Division provid ed as follows:   
“2(ii).  The benefit of an increase in pension is admissible to those 
Government servants who were retired prior to 1st March, 
1997. ” 
 C.A No.805/2016 etc.  3 
 
The respondents in these connected cases , who admittedly retired 
after 01.03.1997 , claim that they are entitled to 10% increase in 
the pension after they have availed the benefit of increase in 
monthly salary of Rs.300/ - under the above Office Memoranda, 
while they were in service. Their re liance is primarily on a series of 
orders passed by this Court in related matters arising out of the 
relief package announced by the Prime Minister.   The matter was 
taken up b y the Tribunal and benefit of 10%  increase in pension 
was extended to the respon dents on the ground that earlier orders 
of this Court have granted such relief, hence these appeal s with 
leave of the Court . 
2. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. 
Adhoc relief was extended by the then Prime Minister by granting 
an increase of Rs.300/ - in the salary of government employees and 
an  increase of 10% in the pension of the employees who retired 
prior to the said date i.e. , 01.3.1997. The Office Memoranda show 
that two distinct reliefs were granted, one for the employees in 
service  through increase in salary and the other for retired 
employees  through increase in pension.  Retired employees are 
those who retired prior to 01. 03.1997, as has been clarified in 
Office Memorandum dated 29.03.1997. Therefore, the respondents 
cannot claim both the benefits; one of increase in the monthly 
salary by Rs.300/ - while in service; and the other of increase in 
pension after retirement. The c utoff date of 01.03.1997 is critical 
and has relevance. It splits the employees into two broad categories  
of in service  employees on the cutoff date  and retired employees on 
the cutoff date  for the purposes of the adhoc relief. Extending 10% 
increase in pe nsion to the employees who were in service on 
01.03.1997 goes against the scheme of the a dhoc relief as it 
creates an imbalance bet ween the two class es of employees by 
extending unjust advantage to one class of employees i.e., the in C.A No.805/2016 etc.  4 
 
service employees on t he cutoff date, who would walk away with 
two distinct adhoc reliefs (i.e., increase in salary and increase in 
pension  after retirement ) when they have been promised only one.     
3. We have also gone through the various orders referred 
to by the learned couns el for the responde nts passed by this Court 
and upon examination we have noticed that through some of these 
orders leave was refused against the judgment of the Tribunal on 
various grounds, which does not form a binding precedent, while 
in other cases, the  question  raised b efore us has not been 
considered. Therefore, reference to earlier orders of this Court does 
not advance the case of the respondents.  
4. For the above reasons, we set aside the impugned 
judgment passed by the Federal Service Tribunal, Islama bad and 
hold that adhoc relief of 10% increase in pension is only admissible 
to employees who stood retired prior to 01.3.1997. The  listed  
appeals are, therefore, allowed, whereas Civil Petitions No.3446 
and 3447 of 2016 are converted into appeals and allowed.  
Civil Petition No.124 to 128, 269 to 271 of 2017,  
5. These petitions filed by the employees against an 
interim order of the Tribunal are disposed of in light of the above 
judgment.
