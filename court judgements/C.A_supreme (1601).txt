Notice to the Advocate General Sindh.  
Affectees of Nalahs : 
2.  There is a big issue for the Government of Sindh so also 
the Government of Pakistan to rehabilitate the affectees of the 
Gujjar Nalah , Orangi Nalah  and Mehmoodabad Nalah , in that, the 
Government of Sindh says that it has no funds altogether to Const.P.No.9 of 2010 etc.  21 
 
provide for the rehabilitation of the affectees.  The statement of the 
Advocate General Sindh on its face appears to be not reasonable 
rather such a statement ought not to have been made by the 
Advocate General Sindh before this Court rather the Sindh 
Government ought to have stated that as it ha d stated before this 
Court which is reflected in the previous order s of this Court, it will 
do everything to provide for the rehabilitation of the affectees of the 
above Nalahs . Funding for such rehabilitation is the responsibil ity 
of the Government of Sindh itself, in that, as a Government, it has 
to provide funding from its available resources and the Sindh 
Government cannot be obliviated of its responsibility. We, therefore, 
direct the Chief Minister, Government of Sindh to en sure that the 
affectees of the  above Nalahs  are rehabilitated by providing them  all 
sorts of amenities, which are required in the present day  living . The 
Chief Minister, Government of Sindh shall ensure that funding is 
arranged for this purpose and the aff ectees of the above Nalahs are 
rehabilitated in all manners preferably within a period of one year. 
An initial report under the hands of the Chief Minister, Government 
of Sindh shall be submitted before this Court within a period of two 
weeks from today.
