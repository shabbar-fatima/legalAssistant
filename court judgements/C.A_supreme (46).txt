[On appeal  against  the judgment  dated  06.10.2017,  passed  by the High
Court  of Balochistan,  Sibi Bench,  in Civil Revision  No.22 of 2016]SUPREME  COURT  OF PAKISTAN

“It is prayed that honourable  court may graciously  modify  
impugned  judgment  and decree  of learned  High Court:  to cancel  the

Daulat  Khan  situated  in Mouza  Boston  Tehsil  Sibi in place  of 1/3^  
share  in sale  price  of  agriculture  land vide impugned  judgment.  “
Through  the impugned  judgment,  Civil Revision  filed  
by Mst. Sehat  Bibi was accepted  and the judgments  and decrees  
passed  by the Courts  below  were set-aside;  resultantly  the suit of 
the Appellant  was decreed  to the extent  of her l/S^d share  out of 
the sale price  of Rs.13,00,000/-.

3. Mst. Sehat Bibi (the Appellant)  and Bahar Khan
(Respondent  No.l) were the only surviving  legal heirs of late Daulat  
Khan (original owner), who died in 1980 by leaving behind  
agricultural  property  bearing  No.56, Khatta  No.39/39  (3 shares),  
Khatta No.40/41 (5 shares)  and Khatta No.58/59 (18 shares)  
situated  at Mohal  and Mouza  Bostan,  Tappa  Saddar,  Tehsil  and 
District  Sibbi. However,  Bahar Khan being son of late Daulat  
Khan took control  of the property  and transferred  the entire  
property  in his own name  by way of alleged  oral gift vide Mutation  
No.56 dated 24.03.1981  (Ex.P/4-A)  while the Appellant  being a 
pardah  nasheen  lady was kept ignorant  of this fact. Bahar  Khan,  
Respondent  No.l, then sold the property  to Muhammad  Zakria,  
Respondent  No.2 vide Mutation  No.226 dated 14.11.2001  (Ex.D/2-  
A). On getting  knowledge,  the Appellant  filed a suit for declaration,  
partition,  cancellation  of mutation  entries,  separate  possession  and 
permanent  injunction  against her brother Bahar Khan,  
Respondent  No.l and Muhammad  Zakria,  Respondent  No.2, which  
was dismissed  by the Trial Court and upheld  by the Appellate  
Court but the High Court while accepting  the revision  of the 
Appellant  vide judgment  dated 06.10.2017  allowed  her suit and 
set-aside  the judgments  and decrees  of the two courts  below. The 
High Court  further  directed  Bahar  Khan,  Respondent  No.l, to pay 
the share  of the Appellant  from Rs. 13,00,000/-  as per Sharia  Law 
within  a period  of three  months.
4- Learned  counsel  for the Appellants  argued  that being
daughter  of late Daulat Khan, she had an absolute  right of 
inheritance  to the extent  of l/S”’ share in the property  of late 
Daulat  Khan.  That the Mutation  No.56 dated  24.03.1981  in favour  
of her brother  Bahar Khan, Respondent  No.l, was illegal being  
based  on fraud  and misdeclaration.  That the grant  of 1 of sale 
price instead  of 1/3^^ share  in the property  of late Daulat  Khan  is 
contrary  to law. That the denial  of 1/3^^^ share  in the agricultural  
land on account  of party interest  is not justified  as only few 
plots (comprising  over 52067  sq fi) equal  to 1-1/4  acres  were sold out 
of the entire property  comprising  over 97-0-98  acres. While  
concluding  his arguments,  learned  counsel  submitted  that the 
impugned  judgment  and decree  of the High Court  be modified  to 
the extent  of 1/3^^ share  in the entire  property  of late Daulat  Khan
-3- 4. CA.No.26-0  of 2017
» instead of 1/3* ’^ share out of the sale price amounting  to 
Rs. 13,00,000/-.
6. Heard  arguments  advanced  by learned  counsel  for the
parties  and perused  the record  with their  able assistance.
7. Before  proceeding  further,  it is important  to mention
here that Mst. Sehat  Bibi, the Appellant,  has only challenged  the 
impugned  judgment  dated 06.10.2017  passed  by the High Court  
whereby  it allowed  the revision  of the Appellant  and ordered  
Respondent  No.l to return  the sale amount  as per Appellant ’s legal  
share. In this scenario,  the question  arises before this Court is 
whether  the Appellant  being co-sharer  is entitled  to receive  1/3 ’"^ 
share  from the legacy  of her father  instead  of receiving  1 share  
in the sale proceeds?5. As against  that learned  counsel  for the Respondents
controverted  the submissions  made  by the learned  counsel  for the 
Appellants  by contending  that the property  was transferred  by way 
of oral gift to Respondent  No.l by his father  during  his life time,  
which was never objected  to by the Appellant.  That all the 
important  issues were decided  against  the Appellant  and the 
findings  given by the Trial Court and upheld  by the Appellate  
Court  are based  on proper  appreciation  of law. That the judgment  
and decree  of the High Court  suffer  from illegalities  and material  
irregularities,  which  are not sustainable  and are liable to be set- 
aside.
8. It is revealed  from perusal  of the record that late
Daulat  Khan,  father  of the Appellant  (Sehat  Bibi) and Respondent  
(Bahar  Khan)  died in the year 1980 leaving  behind  two legal heirs.  
It is an established  principle  of law that legal heirs inherit  property  
to the extent of his/  her share the very moment his/  her 
predecessor  passes  away. Reference  can be made to the case  
titled Farhan  Aslam and others  v. Mst. Nuzba Shaheen  and 
another  (2021 SCMR 179). Similarly,  on the demise  of Daulat  
Khan, his property  was to devolve  upon his son Bahar  Khan and 
daughter  Mst. Sehat Bibi, being the only surviving  legal heirs.  
Nevertheless  Respondent  No.l got attested  Mutation  No.56  dated  
24.03.1981  in his favour  on the basis  of oral gift allegedly  made  by 
his father. We have perused  Mutation  No.56 dated 24.03.1981
-4- 4. C.A.No.26-0  of 2017
f
9.(Ex.P/4-A),  it is written  therein  that Bahar  Khan is the only legal  
heir of late Daulat Khan and there is no other right bearer.  
Through  this Mutation,  Respondent  No.l deprived  the Appellant  
from the inheritance  and he further  sold out some property  to 
Respondent  No.2 etc. Record  shows that Respondent  No.l has 
failed to produce  any witness  to prove the alleged  oral gift in his 
favour. Hence  by withholding  the best evidence  adverse  inference  
can be drawn  under  Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  
1984 and it can, therefore,  be reasonably  concluded  that the said 
inheritance  mutation  was procured  in favour  of Bahar  Khan by 
fraud after the exclusion  of the Appellant  from the inherited  
property,  with connivance  of the revenue  officials  by concealing  the 
fact of existence  of the Appellant.  Hence,  Respondent  No.l could  
not make out a case claiming  ownership  of the entire  property  of 
his late father to the exclusion  of the Appellant.  The Appellant  
being daughter  of deceased  landlord,  could not be deprived  of her 
right in inherited  property  by any illegal  mutation  sanctioned  at the 
behest  of male  heirs. Reference  is placed  on the case titled  Shahro  
and others  v. Mst. Fatima  and others  (PLD 1998 SC 1512).
According  to the Muslim  Law, on the demise  of Daulat  
. Khan, the Appellant  was entitled  to get l/S^d share out of the 
entire  property  of her late father  but the revenue  officials  illegally,  
fraudulently  and dishonestly  deprived  the Appellant  from her legal  
share by mutating  the entire property  in favour  of Bahar  Khan,  
Respondent  No.l. The High Court, while setting aside the 
judgments  and decrees  of the Trial Court  and the Appellate  Court,  
completely  failed  to apply  the law and granted  only 1 / share  out 
of the sale price of Rs. 13,00,000/-  to the Appellant.  The grant  of 
1/3 ’"^ share out of the sale price and exclusion  of the Appellant  
from the inheritance  was against  the law, therefore,  while setting ­
aside the impugned  judgment  dated 06.10.2017  we hold that the 
Appellant  is entitled  to 1/3^^^  share  out of the entire  property  of her 
late father. Resultantly,  the Inheritance  Mutation  No.56 dated  
24.03.1981  (Ex.P/4-A)  and all subsequent  mutations  attested  on 
the basis  of said inheritance  mutation  are hereby  cancelled  as any 
superstructure  built on weak foundation  is not sustainable.  The 
revenue  authorities  are, therefore,  directed  to mutate  the entire  
property  of late Daulat  Khan afresh among  his legal heirs i.e.

APPROVED  FOR REPORTINGBahar  Khan and Mst. Sehat  Bibi, strictly  in accordance  with law. 
It is further  directed  that the property  already  sold out by Bahar  
Khan, Respondent  No.l shall be made part of his share while  
mutating  the estate of late Dault Khan. With the above  
observations,  this appeal  is allowed.
