JUDGMENT  
 
 
MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR, J.  The aforesaid Civil Petitions for 
leave to appeal are directed against the common Judgment dated 
11.02.2022 , passed by the Federal Service Tribunal, Lahore  
(“Tribunal ”) in Appeal Nos.185 (L), 159 -L, 160 -L, 161 -L, 163 -L to 
173-L, 179-L, 146 -L, 184 -L, 174 -L and 162 -L/2020 . By means of  
09 C.M.As No.3837 to 3845 of 2022 in some of the Civil Petitions  
for leave to appeal which were not allotted Civil Petition numbers 
by the Office,  the petitioners also applied for an exemption from 
filing a certified copy of the impugned judgment of the learned 
Tribunal , but the similar order is attached in some other petitions 
therefore, the applications  are allowed  for the reasons mentioned in 
the afor esaid applications and Office is directed to allot number s to 
such civil petitions  also. We have also noted that out of the bunch 
of these civil petitions, a few of these petitions are time -barred, but CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -3- 
  
the rest of the petitions are within time , therefore, instead of non -
suiting the petitioners on a technical ground, we have condoned 
the delay so that the entire bunch of petitions, in which the 
impugned judgment is one and the same, may be taken up and all 
the Civil Petitions may be decided compositely .  
 
2.  The transitory features of the litigation  as resonated  from the 
impugned judgment passed by the learned Tribunal  are as under:  
 
Service Appeals were filed by the respondents (employees) 
for grant of back benefits pursuant to their regularization  
for that they had also filed departmental appeals which 
remained un decided by the competent authority. The 
respondents (employees) sought the direction s of the 
learned Tribunal against the petitioners to grant the arrear s 
of pay and allowances as earlier directed by the Tribunal 
vide orders dated 29.10.2020, 31.01.2020 and 06.02.2020 
in the identical cases filed by the similarly placed employees 
of the Department .  
 
 
3. The Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (“ AAGP ”) argued 
that impugned  Judgment of the learned  Tribunal  is not sustainable 
under law which has resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice  and 
is also based on misreading and non -reading of material available 
on the record. It was further contended that it was the duty of the 
Tribunal to decide the legal questions raised before it . He further 
averred that the learned Tribunal failed to appreciate that the daily 
wages officials whose services have been regularized are not 
admissible for any arrears/back benefits , but their service  shall be 
counted for calculating pension . He further avowed that the 
Finance Division has clarified vide letter dated 25.01.2022 that no 
policy exists for pr otection of daily wages service  at present with 
reference to applicability of the Tribunal’ s judgment dated 
09.09.2020 and the period of such officials shall be coun ted for 
pension from the date on  which they have  been regularized . He 
further added that t he Finance Division clarified vide letter dated 
20.09.2016 that no arrears/back benefits are a dmissible prior to 
07.04.2015.  
 
4. Heard the arguments. The nitty -gritties of the lis demonstrate 
that the respondents (employees) approached the learned Tribunal , 
not for their regularization in service with immediate effect, or with 
effect from initial appointment, but they approached the learned CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -4- 
  
Tribunal for seeking directions against the petitioners for releas ing 
their back benefits pursuant to regularization in service for which 
they also preferred departmental appeals which remained 
unresponded to by the competent authority. The impugned 
judgment of the Tribunal divulges that, while hearing the appeals, 
the petitioners were represented by the learned AAGP , with the 
assistance of departmental representatives M/s Amjad Ali, Syed 
Dastagir, Aziz -ur-Rehman, Safdar Iqbal, Touqeer Ahmad, Babar 
Mahmood and Muahmmad Naeem, Assistant  Superintendents, 
Post Offices. It is also translucent from the impugned judgment of 
the le arned Tribunal that the parties were not at issue and the 
claim of the respondents (employees) were accepted without any 
demur or reservation which is clearly reflected from the findings of 
the learned Tribunal jotted down in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the 
impu gned judgment which are reproduced as under:  
 
“2. The respondents in their detailed parawise 
comments have admitted the fact that the services of 
the appellants have been regularized from their initial 
appointment and the service books have also been 
verified from the Director of Postal Accounts, Lahore. 
The arrears of pay and allowances will be paid with the 
availability of funds from the Finance Division.  
 
4. Indeed the respondents have acknowledged the fact 
that the services of the appellants were regul arized 
from the date of their initial appointments and only 
hitch is availability of funds. The Finance Division is 
responsible to carry out the task of availability funds 
which has already been requested by the respondent -
Department. The respondents are d irected to manage 
for grant of arrears to the appellants within a period of 
three months positively.”  
 
 
5. The whys and wherefores of the impugned judgment leads us to 
an irresistible  conclusion that the learned Tribunal has not 
decided anything by its own, rather it was the petitioners who 
never defended the case vigorously and submitted their own 
comments in which they have admitted the fact that the services of 
the respondents (emplo yees) have been regularized from the date of 
initial appointment, and not only their service books have been 
verified from the concerned Department, but also a commitment 
was made that the arrears of pay and allowances will be paid on 
the availability of f unds from the Finance Division. After this clear CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -5- 
  
statement, nothing was within the dominion and purview of the 
Tribunal to decide when there was no bone of contention between 
the parties, except that the learned Tribunal, keeping in view the 
financial scar city or crunch, allowed the petitioners to arrange the 
funds for discharging liability of arrears within the period of three 
months.  
 
6. When we confronted the learned AAGP with regard to their 
comments filed in the Tribunal conveying a consensual stateme nt, 
he could not controvert the same . We also asked  that before the 
Tribunal, while the lis was taken up for hearing, at least seven 
representatives/assistant superintendents  of post offices were 
present, but nobody took any exception to the 
comments/state ment reproduced in the impugned judgment  but 
yet again, the learned AAGP could not satisfy our query as well. We 
also called upon him to enlighten us if the comments were filed 
under some misunderstanding, or due to any reckless or 
fraudulent conduct of an y official, and/or whether the comments 
before filing were not vetted by the competent authority, and/or 
whether there was any lack of proper sanction, then what action 
was taken against any such delinquent, but nothing was argued or 
placed before us to re but the admission made in the comments 
filed before the learned Tribunal, nor the team of officers from the 
Department present before us while hearing these civil petitions 
could controvert or suggest anything contrary to the views of  the 
Tribunal.  
 
7. It is somewhat strange and  astonishing for us that the 
petitioners have assailed the judgment of the learned Tribunal 
which was simply disposed of with the concurrence of the 
petitioners on the basis of their comments, and nothing was 
decided by the Tribunal , except recording the consensual 
statement made in the comments. The factual position 
encapsulated in the comments cannot be challenged by the 
petitioners due to their acquiescence that the services of the 
respondents (employees) have been regularized and their Service 
books  have also been verified with a further promise to pay arrears 
on the availability of funds, hence at this stage the petitioners’ plea 
is also hit by the doctrine of approbate and reprobate , which CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -6- 
  
means to approve and disapprove. This d octrine is founded on the 
maxim  ‘quod approbo non reprobo’  which translates  to “that which 
I approve, I cannot disapprove ”. It is also known as principle of 
equitable doctrine of election.  
 
8. The acumen and perspicacity of establishing the Service 
Tribunal under Article 212 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“ Constitution ”) is to expeditiously 
decide  appeals with regard to the terms and conditions of service of 
Civil Servants and , according to the command of Secti on 5 (2) of 
the Service  Tribunal s Act, 1973, the Tribunal is deemed to be a 
Civil Court and have the same powers as are vested in such Court 
under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ( “CPC”) including the 
powers of enforcing the attendance of any person and examining 
him on oath; compelling the production of documents and issuing 
commission for the examination of witnesses and documents. The 
Tribunal may on appeal, confirm, set aside, vary or modify t he 
order appealed against to do complete and substantial ju stice 
between the parties. The learned Tribunal passed the judgment 
basically on the admission made by the D epartment in the 
comments presented to the Tribunal and , even on the date of 
hearing , the presence of at least seven officers is marked and the y 
did not raise anything to the contrary which amount s to an  
admission to the written comments filed in response to the appeal. 
Under Section 5 of the Service  Tribunal s Act 1973, the Tribunal is 
deemed to be a Civil Court and have the same powers as are ves ted 
in such court under the CPC,  including certain other powers 
mentioned in the S ection , but not excluding or disregarding other 
powers of the Civil Court provided in the CPC,  therefore, the 
learned Tribunal while exercising  powers of Civil Court enshrine d 
under the CPC  had rightly  looked in to the admission made by the 
petitioners  in their comments . It is worthwhile to reiterate that t he 
respondents (employees) neither approach ed the learned Tribunal 
for any relief of regularization  of their contractual services which 
could have been decided in view of the dictums laid down by this 
Court , nor in view of any special law promulgated for the 
regularization  of contractual employees , nor in view of  any 
Government policy or cabinet decision. On the contrary, their CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -7- 
  
services were already regularized by the Department. In such an 
eventuality, if the Department of  its own will and volition decides to 
initiate an y action for regularizing the se rvices of contractual 
employees , the said action cannot be termed or declared illegal or 
unconstitutional unless the rights of similarly placed persons or 
employees are contravened or exploited  due to such regularization  
which is altogether  missing in the case  and does not require any 
indulgence .  
 
9. The analogy and/ or raison d'être  of the provision for decreeing 
the suit by the civil court as encapsulated under O rder XII, Rule 6, 
CPC is quite applicable in the present circumstances  of the case 
which empowers  and qualifies the civil court to dispose of the lis 
with regard t o which there is no dispute between parties , but for 
this purpose the entire plaint or written statement is required to be 
read for the purposes of finding out the nature of the admission , 
whether it is clear, specific, unambiguous, definite and categorical 
and the C ourt is bound to examine the plaint and written 
statement with diligent application of mind to ascertain the nature 
of admission. The elemental characteristic  of an admission is that 
it should  be a condensed and cautious act. The p recondition and 
benchmark of an admission is that it should be unconditional, 
unambiguous and intend the same to be read and construed as  an 
admission. The legislative intent is clear that it should be 
unambiguous and  clear. The Black's Law Dictionary (Tenth 
Edition ) at page 56  explains the word “Admission” means “any 
statement or assertion made by a party to a case and offered 
against that party ; an acknowled gment that the facts are true”.  
The admission within the bou nds of law would discernibly have the 
aftermath of wrapping up the case without the  determination of 
any further question and evidence. The legislative purpose of Order 
XII, Rule 6 , CPC is to cut short the length of litigation with 
forward -thinking compreh ension and without the imposition of any 
irrational constraint , rather  the court should consciously and 
judicially look into the fundamental constituents of the admission 
for its satisfaction whether the lis can attain  finality or not in the 
facts and circ umstances of each case. In the event of any 
ambiguous, conditional or unclear admission, the court cannot be CPs.1874,1987 -2001, 2091, 2605,  2477, 2478 /2022  & CMAs.3837 -3845/2022   
 
                                                      -8- 
  
left to interpretative determination , but the proper course would be 
that the case should be decided on merits after denouement of  a 
full-fledged t rial. The cumulative upshot is that there should b e an 
unambiguous and unequivocal admission by the other side of his 
liability and commitment towards other side of the lis. 
 
 
10. In the wake of the above discussion, we do not find any 
illegality or perversity in the judgment of the learned Tribunal 
warranting any interference by this Court. The Civil P etitions are 
therefore dismissed and leave is refused.
