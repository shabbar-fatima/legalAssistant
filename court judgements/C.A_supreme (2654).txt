 SHORT ORDER  
 
SH. RIAZ AHMED, CJ.  Through this common short order,  we propose to dispose of the 
captioned petitions which were filed under Artic le 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, assaili ng insertion of Article 8 AA in the Conduct of General 
Elections Order 2002 (Chief Executive Order N o. 7 of 2002) whereby it  was enacted that 
a person who had been defeated  in the elections of National and Provincial Assemblies 
held in October 2002, shall be di squalified to contest the electi on for a seat in the Senate. 
After hearing learned counsel representing the petitioners in th ese petitions and  
Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, the lear ned Attorney General for Pakistan, and for reasons to 
be incorporated subsequently through a detaile d order, we hold that Article 8-AA ibid, is 
discriminatory in nature and as  such violative of Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan. We furt her hold that disqualification attributable to defeat in 
consequence of lawful act of contesti ng election of the Na tional and Provincial 
Assemblies should have been provided in th e original order itself, being impugned 
herein, so that, the affected persons should have an opportun ity to avoid to suffer such 
disqualification.  Announced in open Court at Lahore on 10-02-2003.
