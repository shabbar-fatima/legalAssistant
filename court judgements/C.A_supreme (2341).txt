O R D E R  
 
  We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner 
who has read to us from the impugned order of the High Court 
dated 03.08.2023 whereby a number of juris dictional and 
maintainability objections were remanded for consideration by 
the Trial Court. The proceedings before the Trial Court were 
already fixed for hearing on 05.08.2023. The case was called a 
number of times but neither the petitioner nor his autho rized 
representative were present in the court. As a result , the Trial 
Court proceeded ex-parte and decided  the complaint filed by the CRL.P.921/2023  etc 2
Election Commission of Pakistan (“ECP”) without hearing the 
petitioner on 05.08.2023 convicting him for offences under 
Sections 167 and 173 of the Election s Act, 2017 and sentencing 
him to 03 years S.I . We are also informed that the petitioner in 
his statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC on 01.08.2023 
had expressed the intention to produce defence witness es. That 
applic ation was turned down by the Trial Court on 02.08.2023 
for the reason that the four witnesses mentioned in the list were 
not relevant to the controversy in issue.  
 
2.  We asked the learned ASC , who represents the           
ECP-Complainant before the Trial Court as well as the High 
Court , whether the aforem entioned two points are correct . He 
has candidly acknowledged the claim made by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner  to be true . He has also admitted that 
notwithstanding the remand order passed by the High Court  on 
03.08.2023  whereby the jurisdictional and maintainability 
objections were returned to the Trial Court , the final judgment of 
the Trial Court dated 05.08.2023 fail ed to decide the same 
afresh. Instead the final judgment reaffirms the Trial Cou rt’s 
earlier order s dated 05.05 .2023 and 08.07.2023 which ha d 
considered these  points. However, the same were set aside by 
the High Court through order dated 03.08.2023  that is impugned 
before us . In this respect, the final judgment of the Trial Court 
dated 05.08.2023 , prima facie , defies  the direction of remand 
issued by the High Court by relying on its earlier point of view 
that already stands rejected by the High Court.  CRL.P.921/2023  etc 3
3.  These are serious point s of law that deserve 
consideration but we are told that an appeal against the final 
judgment passed by the Trial Court on 05.08.2023 has been filed 
before the High Court on 08.08.2023 . The petitioner is in jail 
since 05.08.2023 . Therefore, a n application for suspension of 
sentence of the petitioner has also been filed before the High 
Court which is fixed for hearing tomorrow i.e. , 24.08.2023. 
Notwithstanding  the legal issues highlighted to us and noted 
above regarding the jurisdiction of the Trial Court and the 
maintainability of the complaint, the procedural propriety of the 
trial and compliance with the due process requirements ordained  
by the Constitution , we consider that the High Court is the first 
Court which should  hear and decide such matter s. As the 
petitioner’s application for suspension of sentence is fixed for 
hearing tomorrow , it is appropriate that out of respect for the 
High Court we first await its decision .

petitions to come up for hearing  at 02:00 PM on 24.08.2023 .
