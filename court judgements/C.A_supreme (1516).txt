    O R D E R  
  Mr. Asif Fasihuddin Khan Vardag, an Advocate of the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan (Petitioner), has invoked the jurisdiction of this 
Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan , 1973 by means of the instant petition.  
2. The petitioner inter alia, has alleged corruption by the higher 
echelons in the construction/completion of New Benazir Bhutto 
International Airport Project, Islamabad (NBBIAP), which was Const. P.33 of 2013  3
required to be completed at  cost of Rs.35 billion; and as it has not been 
completed on the due date i.e. December, 2011, the initial cost now has 
shoot up to Rs.73 billion  and there is every likelihood that it may 
further be escalated to Rs.90 billion.  
4. The petitioner further alle ged that Air Marshal (R etd.) Khalid 
Chaudhry was appointed as Director General, Civil Aviation 
Authority (DG, CAA) through executive arrangements made by the 
then Minister for Defence without observing legal formalities, 
therefore, he has pivotal role in t his organized loot. Besides, he ha d 
also been given the charge of other mega project, namely, the Multan 
International Airport.  
5. The above facts, including allegations of corruption, necessitated 
assum ption of  jurisdiction to examine, inter alia , as to whether the 
appointment of incumbent DG, CAA (respondent No.3) had been 
made in accordance with law, while adhering to the principle of 
transparency. And also to ascertain the status of the construction of 
both the above said airports.  DG, CAA has append ed an Inquiry 
Report with CMA 4379/2013  prepared by a Committee constituted by 
Ministry of Defence comprising of the following  officers :- 
(i) Lt. Gen.(Retd.) Shahid Niaz  
 (ii) Member Implementation & Monitoring of Planning   
  Commission.  
 
(iii) Additional Secre tary, Military  Finance.  
(iv) Director General CAA  Const. P.33 of 2013  4
(v) Director Planning & Development CAA  
It is to be noted that the Committee was required to conduct 
performa nce audit in a manner which would  not hamper the overall 
progress of developmental works at the site .  
6. Notices were issued to the respondents i.e. Federation of 
Pakistan and others ; whose attendance has been marked in the title of 
the order , who  appeared alongwith their learned Advocates and 
advanced arguments at considerable length . They also placed on 
record documents in support of their respective pleas. On having 
taking into consideration pleadings, arguments and all other 
documents, the instant petition under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan particularly  the report 
of the Commi ttee which was authorized to conduct a comprehensive 
study  performance , audit of the project and to inquire into the reasons 
for increase in the c ost of the project, to identify the persons 
responsible for this state of affairs, to suggest ways  and means to bring 
this project on track for its expeditious completion as well as the 
Auditor General’s report . The CAA was directed to file a statement .    
A statement has been  filed on behalf of the Proje ct Director today in 
the Court which reads as fo llows: - 
             “Most respectfully submitted:  
1. That the New Benazir Bhutto International Airport Project (“The 
Project”) from its very inception was not conceived and planned 
properly.  Const. P.33 of 2013  5
2. That to start with, the selection of the Project Site was faulty an d 
to date there is no water availability for the Project. Initially, it was 
planned that water would be brought from the nearby Shahpur 
Dam which is approximately twenty -one (21) kilometers away 
from the Project Site. More perplexingly, there is not enough  water 
in the Shahpur Dam, hence, the plan now is to construct small 
dams by harvesting rain water.  
3. That the PC -1 of the Project was approved at all levels without the 
design and other essential components relating to different aspects 
of the Project. Impo rtantly, the work on the Project was started 
without any design.  
4. That the Project was divided into seventeen (17) packages which 
created enormous interface/integration issues resulting in delay 
and cost overruns.  
5. That strangely enough, separate packages fo r piling and pile -caps 
were created and, that too, without the design of the Passenger 
Terminal Building.  
6. That all payments to the Contractors  were made in strict 
conformity with applicable contractual provisions (clause 67.1 of 
the Special Conditions of C ontract) where  under CAA was bound 
to forthwith give effect to PMC (Engineer)’s decisions regardless of 
final resolution of a disputed payment. Failing to give effect to the 
PMC’s decision was to result in accruing of interest on the 
pending payment in add ition to the contractor’s right to suspend 
works.  
7. That be that as it may, the Federal Government is fully cognizant 
of the importance and gravity of the matter and has already 
referred the same to the Federal Investigation Agency which has 
already nominate d a team of competent officers to investigate the 
matter.  
8. That meanwhile, the Federal Government is fully committed and 
determined to complete the Project and has passed instructions to 
this effect. At present, around sixty -seven percent (67%) of the 
works  of the Project are complete with approximately ninety -two 
percent (92%) airside infrastructure complete and approximately 
fifty-five percent (55%) of the Passenger Terminal Building.  
9. That the Contractors  are being pushed for timely completion of 
their sco pe of works and penal action against Contractors  is also 
being taken where necessary. For example, two contracts i.e. 
Package -8B (Electric Power & Telecommunication) and Package -
8C1 (ATC Complex) have been terminated and their respective 
scope of work is t o be completed at the risk and cost of the 
terminated Contractors  as per the scheme of contract. Early 
completion is the utmost desire of the Government”.  Const. P.33 of 2013  6
7. We may point out here that the above report is, prima facie,  not 
acceptable as correct. The reason s whereof shall be spelt out later on 
particularly in respect of the payments made to the Contractors noted  
herein above and thus ; for the reasons to be recorded later, it is held :-   
i) That the appointment of Air Martial (Retd.) Khalid  
Chaudhry has been made in a non -transparent  manner 
as well as without strictly following the available law 
on the subject . Therefore, the notification of 
appointment of Air Martial (Retd.) Khalid Chaudhry 
dated  18th July, 2012  is declared illegal, void ab initio  
and of no  legal consequence.  
ii) As the appointment of the DG, CAA has been declared 
void ab initio , illegal being made in non -transparent 
manner, therefore, the Federal Government is directed 
to appoint DG, CAA as early as could be possible by 
following the law an d rules on the subject as well as 
the principles of transparency.  
iii) The project of the New Benazir Bhutto International 
Airport Project, Islamabad (NBBIAP),  prima facie,  
suffers from illegalities, irregularities, corruption and 
corrupt practices and the  delay caused in its 
completion on account of illegal deeds, omissions and 
commissions of the consultants Lo uis Burger and  all 
other concerned persons who were responsible for 
selecting the  site, prepa ring the designs and also 
award ing contracts to the con tractors.  
iv)         The Contractors responsible  for the completion of 
different respective projects except Al -Tariq Pvt. Ltd., Const. P.33 of 2013  7
prima facie  are responsible for causing the delay in the 
completion of the projects as on account of their such 
conduct the value/ prices of the projects has increased 
inasmuch  as raising its cost from Rs.37 billion  to Rs.73 
billion. There is no possibility to complete the project 
in the near future except a tentative assessment by the 
respondent s that the project may be completed  in the 
year 2014 -2015. Therefore, subject to all just exceptions, 
this case require s a thorough probe  on the basis of 
tentative assessments made in the Commi ttee’s report 
of Let. Gen. (Retd.) Shahid Niaz as well as the audit 
report prepared by the Auditor Ge neral of Pakista n 
and the stance taken by the Project Director reference 
to which , with  certain exceptions , have already been 
made hereinabove.  
v)        The Government of Pakistan had already made the 
reference for conducting inquiries/investigations and 
to fix criminal liabilities upon all the concerned 
persons/contractors, therefore, we direct the DG 
Investigation, FIA to supervise the 
inquiries/investigations himself and to complete the 
same expeditiously.  
vi)  The Federal Government is required to take all  
necessary steps to ensure the completion of the project 
as early as could be possible. However, it is made clear 
that subject to the contractual agreements the 
consultants, designers and all other Contractors to 
whom contracts have been awarded, shall  continue to 
complete the work and the competent authority if 
need be, proceed against any one of them for the 
purpose of ensuring completion of the work as early as Const. P.33 of 2013  8
possible and if so required, to constitute a committee 
headed by a senior officer to super vise the completion 
of work and to remove any and all difficulties in this 
way.  
vii)         As regards  report of the Auditor General in respect of 
over -payment of Rs.1556.47 million  is concerned,  this 
audit objection so far has not been  removed, therefore, 
LTH (JV) is required to deposit this amount with  the 
Exchequer within a period of seven days subject to 
intimation to the Registrar for our perusal in 
Chambers.  
viii)        As all  the respondents have cooperated with the 
Court by making their appearance through 
counsel, therefore, the passports which were 
deposited by them with the Registrar, shall be 
returned back to them subject to furnishing 
undertaking that whenever they are required to 
appear before the FIA or any other 
Agency /Committee  for the purpose of  inqu iry or 
investigation, they shall cooperate without any 
hesitation and in case of non -cooperation, the FIA 
shall be free to undertake any step s under the law 
to enforce their attendance.  
ix)        The FIA is directed that inquiry process must be 
completed in the shortest possible time. Subject to 
outcome of inquiry by the FIA or any other 
Agency/Committee  constituted by the 
Government, the LTH(JV) Pvt. Ltd. shall be 
entitled to adjust the amount which has been Const. P.33 of 2013  9
deposited if payments are cleared by the 
compet ent authority in accordance with law and 
rules and in view of the observations made herein 
above.  
8. The instant matter stands disposed of. The parties are left to 
bear their own costs.
