O R D E R  
 
   Learned counsel for the petitioners submits 
that the order dated 22.03.2023 issued by the Election 
Commission of Pakistan ( ECP) annuls the polling date 
fixed by the President of Pakistan in exercise of his power 
under Section 57(1) of the Elections Act, 2017 read with 
Article 112 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Const. P.  No.5 OF 202 3 2
Pakistan, 1973 ( Constitution ). It is, inter alia, contended 
that t he ECP does not have any power under the law and 
the Constitution to pas s such an order. It appears that 
the ECP has in the said order taken refuge behind Article 
254 of the Constitution. The interpretation of that 
provision of the Constitution by this Court, inter alia , in 
Presidential Reference No.1 of 1988  (PLD 1989 SC 75) , 
Rashid Ahmed   vs. Government of Punjab  (PLD 2010 
SC 573) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians 
vs. Federal of Pakistan  (PLD 2022 SC 574)  envisages 
post facto  protection of the validity of the acts performed 
beyond the time fixed therefor by the Co nstitution . The 
said Article of the Constitution does not con fer the prior 
authorization of delay in the execution of obligation s 
required to be  performed within a specified time  
prescribed by the Constitution . He further urges that the 
grounds given for extending the date of poll to 
08.10.2023  have no backing of law or the Constitution. 
Such grounds may  be available in several situations . In 
the past General Elections ha ve been held 
notwithstanding that such factors were present  at the 
time of the elections, for instance in 1988 and 2008 . 
2.  Timely General Elections held “honestly, justly, 
fairly and in accordance with law” are crucial for the Const. P.  No.5 OF 202 3 3
democratic system of government mandated by our 
Constitution. Any flaw , deficiency or failing in the holding 
of General Elections is, prima facie, a matter of public 
importance that affects the fundamental rights of the 
voting public.  
3.   In the first instance, therefore, notice is issued 
to the Respondents in this petition. The ECP shall come 
prepare d to assist on the legal questions and the factual 
points raised in the petition.        
4.  To come up tomorrow i.e. 28.03.202 3 at 
11:30 am  for further hearing.
