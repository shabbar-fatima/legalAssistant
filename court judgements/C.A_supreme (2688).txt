ORDER  
 
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.  – On 
05.01.2012, an order was passed but instead of repeating the facts 
noted therein, the said order is reproduced hereinbelow in extenso : -  
“Dr. Babar Awan was enrolled as Advocate of this Court o n 
29.05.2000 and status of Sr. ASC was conferred upon him 
on 29.05.2008. Presently, he is appearing in Reference No. 
1 of 2011 sent by the President of Pakistan under Article 
186 of the Constitution. Hearing of the Reference, 
considering it to be one of th e most important matters, is 
pending in this Court for the last few months. On 
04.01.2012, a notice of contempt of Court was issued to 
him by a Bench of this Court comprising two Hon’ble 
Judges in respect of a press conference addressed by him 
on 01.12.201 1. After receipt of notice, he addressed the 
electronic media at the podium of the Supreme Court Gate 
and perhaps when inquired from him about issuance of the 
notice, he stated that in the past too, criminal cases were 
registered against him when he was co nducting the cases 
of Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto and the incumbent President 
Mr. Asif Ali Zardari and concerning the contempt notice 
issued to him, he uttered the following words: -  
 
This utterance made on the electronic media was telecast 
by different cha nnels, which believably had been seen by a 
large number of  people. The content of the utterance, the 
gestures made and the body language were indicative of 
an attempt to ridicule the Court. We have inquired from 
Dr. Babar Awan about it, who instead of den ying the same, 
stated that the words uttered on the television in fact 
reflected respect. To fully appreciate the content and the 
manner of what he said, we asked the Secretary 
Information to make arrangement for displaying the REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 17.01.2012  3 
relevant video clips. Accord ingly, on multimedia affixed in 
the courtroom, DVD was played which was not only 
watched by the senior members of the bar, but also by Mr. 
Yasin Azad, President, Supreme Court Bar Association and 
Mr. Latif Afridi, Vice Chairman, Pakistan Bar Council. Both 
of them have condemned the same. Mr. Latif Afridi went to 
the extent of saying that these things should not have 
happened and in any case he would stand by the judiciary 
in the matter. We believe that interaction between the 
Bench and the Bar depends upon mutual respect. 
Irrespective of the fact which Bench issued the notice, the 
fact remains that it was part of the judiciary, therefore, a 
person who is a senior counsel appearing before the 
Supreme Court, instead of uttering the words reproduced 
above and m aking gestures as if he had no care for the 
issuance of the notice because prior to the utterance under 
consideration, he said that in the past too he had been 
charged with criminal cases for conducting the cases of 
Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Za rdari. We do not 
know those facts, but prima  facie, we are of the view that 
the conduct of Dr. Babar Awan is unbecoming of an 
Advocate of the Supreme Court, therefore, we issue notice 
to him under Rule 30 of Order IV of the Supreme Court 
Rules, 1980 to exp lain as to why his name be not removed 
from the Roll of the Advocates of this Court.  
2.   Registrar is directed to hand over copies of the 
notice and the DVD to Dr. Babar Awan, which shall be 
furnished to him by the Secretary Information during the 
course  of the day. He may file reply to the notice on or 
before 09.01.2012. Proceedings of the Reference are also 
postponed till the next date of hearing.”     
 
2.   In compliance with the above order, notice was issued to 
Mr. Babar Awan, Sr. ASC , which was serv ed upon him reportedly on 
05.01.2012 as the case was fixed for hearing on 09.01.2012, but  the 
same could not be taken up due to unavoidable circumstances, as 
such, it was postponed for today.  REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 17.01.2012  4 
3.   Mr. Babar Awan, Sr. ASC  has appeared and has stated that 
he needs some time to engage a counsel. It has been pointed out to 
him that more than sufficient time has already been granted to him 
and as this Bench is seized with one of the most important case s, i.e., 
the Reference sent by the President of Pakistan und er Article 186 of 
the Constitution concerning the death sentence awarded to late 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan . Therefore, we 
have to proceed with the case , as early as possible , without causing 
delay in any manner and unless the q uestion of notice, which has been 
issued to him under Order IV rule 30 of the Supreme Court  Rules, 
1980 is decided, it would not be appropriate to proceed with the 
Reference . It may not be out of place to mention here that on the last 
date of hearing when the order dated 05.01.2012 was passed, video 
clips were repeatedly displayed in the Courtroom in the presence of 
Mr. Babar Awan, Sr. ASC wherein he had uttered certain words /made 
gestures  after receipt of the contempt of Court notice  issued to  him by 
a Ben ch of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court with a view to show a 
degree of hatred  by him. After seeing the video clips , the members of 
the legal fraternity  present in the Courtroom and in particular , Mr. Latif 
Afridi , Vice Chairman, Pakistan Bar Council and Mr . Yasin Azad, 
President, Supreme Court  Bar Association , voluntarily came to the 
rostrum and condemned the above words and gestures of Mr. Babar 
Awan. Mr. Latif Afridi went to the extent of saying that such things 
ought not to have happened , and that, in any case , they would stand 
by the judiciary in the matter.  
4.   We have already observed that good relationship between 
the Bench and the Bar depends upon mutual respect. This institution, 
being the apex Court under the Constitution, deserves to be respecte d 
by all concerned, particularly the Advocates and the members of the REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 17.01.2012  5 
legal fraternity to whom licences are issued for appearing before this 
Court . If the institution like the Supreme Court is not respected and an 
attempt is made to lower its prestige in t he eyes of the general public, 
then it would be very difficult to administer justice because this is the 
Court whose working/decisions send a message down to the Court of 
the Magistrate and the Civil Judge that they should administer justice 
without fear or favour , and if the Court is maligned  by anyone , then it 
would not be possible to maintain its dignity and status.  
5.   We have been informed that it is not the first time that  
Mr. Babar Awan  has been issued contempt of Court notice by a 2-
Member Bench of this Court, but prior to it also, the Lahore High Court  
had issued similar notice s to him . He had been appearing before this 
Court  and this Court has always respected him, but the attitude shown 
by him on 04.01.2012 after receipt of notice, details of w hich have 
been mentioned hereinabove, compelled this Court to issue a notice to 
him in terms of Order IV rule 30 of the Supreme Rules, 1980 . 
However, without dilating further upon the matter, in order to provide 
him fair opportunity, we grant him time to f ile reply, but at the same 
time to ensure dignity and respect of the Court, we temporarily 
suspend his licence to appear before this Court. And, no sooner he has 
engaged a counsel and filed the reply , he would make a request to the 
Registrar for the purpos e of taking up this matter.  
6.   As far as the Presidential Reference is concerned, we ask 
the learned Attorney General for Pakistan  to inform the President of 
Pakistan that in view of the order dated 05.01.2012  and today’s order, 
the licence of Mr. Babar  Awan, Sr. ASC  has temporarily been 
suspended, therefore, it would be appropriate if another counsel is 
appointed to address arguments in the Reference, which indeed is one 
of the most important cases in the history of this Court.  REFERENCE 1 -2011  
DT 17.01.2012  6 
7.   The Registrar is di rected to collect the enrolment files of 
Mr. Babar Awan from the Pakistan Bar Council  and the Punjab Bar 
Council whe re he was enrolled as Advocate of the High Court as well 
as the judicial files in pursuance whereof he was issued contempt of 
Court notices by the Lahore High Court , so that we may know the 
result there of.  
8.   The c ase is adjourned to a date in office and shall be taken 
up no sooner the President of Pakistan nominates another counsel  to 
address this Court in the Reference.
