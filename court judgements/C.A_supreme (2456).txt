Yahya Afridi, J. - There appears to be judicial consensus that the 
application of principles for the grant  or refusal  of bail in ‘cross -cases’ 
depend s on the particular  facts and circumstances of each case . This 
proposition can be illustrated  by the  ratio d ecidendi  of the following 
cases :  
 
I. To constitute a cross -case, the mere assertion of a counter -
case is not enough. Courts are to tentatively assess that the 
parties, the venue , and the transaction prima facie  led to the 
result of a single incident narra ted differently by the 
opposing party. The rationale  is that frivolous and false 
counter -cases , which can exaggeratedly be set up by the 
opposite party , do not gain an advantage of the general rule 
and benefits arising out of a counter -case.1 
  
II. In case s of counter versions arising from the same incident, 
one given by the complainant in the F.I.R. , and the other 
given by the opposite party, bail i n appropriate cases is  
granted as a rule on the ground s of further inquiry  for the 
reason that the question a s to which version is correct  is to 
be decided after the recording of pro and contra  evidence 
during the trial , and also to ascertain which party was the 
aggressor and which party was  aggressed upon . The  refusal 
of bail in such cases is an exception.2 
  
III. The e xception  to the rule of the grant of bail  is in cases of 
counter versions or cross -cases , where prima facie  the facts 
of the case suggest that the party seeking bail was an 
aggressor and /or the material on the record suggests that 
the said party ha d an effective role in causing fatal injury .3 
 
IV. In counter versions of opposing parties, without specifying 
an effective role in causing fatal injury , leaves room for 
consideration of rendering a case within the purview of

further inquiry, as provided u nder section 497 of Cr.P.C.4 
 
  
V. In cross -cases, wherein one party is granted the concession  
of bail , similar treatment is also  rendered to the other side.5 
 
2. In the instant case , distinct  versions  of how the events unfolded, 
which lead to the commissi on of the crime,  have been  put forth by the  
contesting parties. The time and place of the occurrence are admitted by 
both parties. However, the facts of the present case d o not prima facie 
put forth which party was an aggressor , as it was a common path clo se 
to the dwelling place of both parties , and both were  armed with firearm s.  
 
3. Admittedly , both parties ha ve recognised  the general role of fi ring 
firearms  at each other , leading to injuries on both sides. In parti cular , 
the petitioner  has not been reported to hav ing had  an effective role  in 
causing injury to  any of the two  deceased or injured  persons.   
 
4. It is also noted that the complainant party in  FIR No. 681, who are 
accused of the general role of firing resulting in  injury to five persons 
belongi ng to the petitioner’s side , have all been granted bail after arrest 
vide order s dated 07.09.2022, 12.10.2022, and 27.10.2022 . And thus,  
denying bail to the petitioner in FIR No. 681 , when the two cases prima 
facie are cross -cases , would not be appropriate .   
 
5. It would also be pertinent to note that a counter version  put forth 
by a party which is contrary to the one already rendered by a 
complainant  in an  FIR, if it fulfils the essentials of a cross -case as to the 
time and place of the commission of an offence ; would constitute a cross -
case, and it cannot be declared to be otherwise solely on the ground that 
the party claiming its version to be a cross -case did not allege self -
defence in the counter version of the events leading to the commission of 
the o ffence and recording of the FIR in which he is nominated as an 
accused.    
 
6. Accordingly, this petition is converted into an appeal, and the same 
is allowed. Consequently, the petitioner is admitted to bail subject to

furnishing a bail bond in the sum of  Rs. 100,000/ - (Rupees one hundred 
thousand only) , with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of 
the trial court.  
 
7. Above  are the reasons for respectful ly differing  from the majority 
opinion of my learned brothers in the instant case.
