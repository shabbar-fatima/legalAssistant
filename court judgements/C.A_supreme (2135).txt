JUDGMENT  
  Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.-  In the wake of 
absconsion, commencing from January 1992, Nazeer Khan, 
petitioner, accused in a case of  homicide, was finally tried by a 
learned Additional Sessions Judge at Kohat, in the year 2011; 
he stood convicted and sentenced vide judgment dated 
15.3.2011, upheld by a learned Division Bench of the 
Peshawar High Court vide impugned judgment dated 
15.10.2014.  
On the fateful day i.e. 22.1.1992 at about 1.30 p.m., over 
a dispute of land, the petitioner shot Nisar Muhammad, 
whereas his brother, Jan Muham mad, targeted Ghaffar Gul, 
PW; the former succumbed to the injuries leaving behind his 
last declaration pointed upon petitioner’s culpability; his 
brother though exonerated from being in the community of 
intention, nonetheless, was held guilty for murderou s assault; 
he was convicted and sentenced without challenge. Upon Criminal Petition No.140-P of 201 4 
      2 
 
petitioner’s arrest, the same prosecution evidence has been 
pressed into service to drive home the charge.  
2.   Though wounded critically , the last declarant  was 
found by the medical office r well within capacity to share 
details of the incident, a narrative found by us as 
straightforward and confidence inspiring  besides being in 
harmony with ocular account and medical evidence . 
Petitioner’s absence from law sans any justification . Given 
petitioner’s advance age , he has already been dealt with 
leniently . Impugned judgment being well within the remit of 
law as well as facts applicable thereto does not call for 
interference. Petition is dismissed  and leave to appeal refused .
