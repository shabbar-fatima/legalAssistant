ORDER  
 
In the judgment of this Court dated 30.3.2012  
reported as Alleged Corruption in Rental Power Plants etc  (2012 
SCMR 773) , inter alia , following directions were made: - 
“84. Thus, in the light of the above facts and 
circumstances, we hold as under: -- 
(i) Prior to the introduction of RPPs, the system of 
generation of electricity under the control 
and management of Ministry of Water and 
Power, WAPDA, PEPCO, GENCOs, etc., had 
sufficient potential to produce more 
electrici ty, but instead of taking curative 
steps for its improvement, including 
clearance of circular debt of the IPPs or 
resorting to other means of generation of 
electricity, billions of rupees were spent on 
BHIKKI  and SHARAQPUR  RPPs, which 
proved complete failu re because the object 
could not be achieved as the shortage of  
electricity  persistently  continued,  and  yet  
more  RPPs were installed;  
(ii) The Federal Government/  WAPDA/  
PEPCO/GENCOs had failed to control 
pilferage of electricity from the system 
beca use of bad governance and failure of the 
relevant authorities to enforce the writ of the 
Government. Therefore, the Government is 
required to improve the existing system of 
generation and transmission of electricity, by 
taking all necessary steps, includin g clearing CMA No.3685 -2012 - 3 - 
of circular debt, etc., so that electricity can 
be generated to the maximum capacity;  
(iii) The contracts of all the RPPs - solicited and 
unsolicited, signed off or operational, right 
from BHIKKI AND  SHARAQPUR upto 
PIRANGHAIB, NAUDERO -I AND 
NAUD ERO -II were entered into in 
contravention of law/PPRA Rules, which, 
besides suffering from other irregularities, 
violated the principle of transparency and 
fair and open competition, therefore, the 
same are declared to be non -transparent, 
illegal and void ab initio. Consequently, the 
contracts of RPPs are ordered to be 
rescinded forthwith  and  all  the  persons  
responsible  for  the  same  are liable  to  be  
dealt  with  for  civil  and  criminal  action  in 
accordance with law;  
(iv) On accepting the ADB 's report, 9 out of 19 
RPPs were allowed to operate, details 
whereof have been mentioned hereinbefore. 
Subsequently, 6 out of 9 RPPs were 
discontinued either having been signed off or 
having failed to achieve the target COD 
whereas remaining RPPs, i.e., KARKEY, 
NAUDERO -I and GULF  are functioning, 
but they are producing electricity much less 
than their generation capacity, except GULF  
which is producing electricity close to the 
agreed capacity. PPR (Piranghaib, Multan)  
has not generated electricity at all, a lthough 
down payment was made to it, which has not 
been returned. As far as RESHMA  is 
concerned, though it achieved partial COD, 
but the same was not accepted by NEPRA. 
BHIKKI  and SHARAQPUR  were paid 
exorbitant rentals in billions of rupees, but 
generation  of electricity was much below the 
agreed capacity;  
(v) The production from the RPPs is far below the 
maximum capacity agreed between the 
parties as per the terms of the RSCs,  which  
is  evident  from  the  above  charts.  The cost 
per unit kWh is also on  the very high side. 
These RPPs have not achieved target COD. 
The contracts of all these RPPs are not 
transparent, as it has been discussed 
hereinabove, therefore, the same are hereby 
ordered to be rescinded forthwith;  
(vi) The Ministry of Finance, WAPDA, PEPCO as CMA No.3685 -2012 - 4 - 
well as GENCOs are responsible for causing 
huge losses to the public exchequer, which 
run into billions of rupees by making 7% to 
14% down payments to, and purchasing 
electricity on higher rates, from RPPs, 
therefore, steps are required to be take n to 
effect recovery of the amounts with mark up 
outstanding against the RPPs whose 
contracts have been signed off or who had 
failed to achieve COD within the stipulated 
time in terms of the performance guarantees;  
(vii) The RPPs mode of generation of elec tricity 
has proved a total failure and incapable of 
meeting the demand of electricity on a short 
term basis. The cost of electricity so produced 
is on very high  side  and  is  not  
commensurate  with  the  provisions of 
section 7 of the Act, 1997. As per latest 
report, KARKEY  and GULF  are producing 
only 31 to 81 MW  and 51 to 61 MW  at an 
average cost per unit kWh of Rs.35  to Rs.52  
and Rs.18  to Rs.19  rupees respectively, as 
per information supplied in 
October/November, 2011, which also are 
subject to adjustm ent of fuel cost component 
and NTDC overhead transmission charges on 
account of which prices are likely to increase 
enormously. Thus, it is clear violation of the 
rights guaranteed to the citizens in terms of 
Articles 9 and 24 of Constitution and the 
Regul ation of Generation, Transmission and 
Distribution of Power Act, 1997;  
(viii) It is the constitutional requirement that every 
action of Governmental authorities should be 
aimed at socio economic development of the 
country. In terms of Constitution and Act,  
1997, the NEPRA is mandated to safeguard 
the interests of the consumers, but the 
concerned officials of NEPRA failed to 
perform their duties diligently;  
(ix) All the Government functionaries, including 
the Ministers for Water and Power holding 
charge in 2 006 and onward and from 2008 to 
onward, during whose tenure the RPPs were 
approved/set up and Minister as well as 
Secretary Finance holding the charge when 
the down payment was increased from 7% to 
14%, prima facie, violated the principle of 
transparency u nder Articles 9 and 24 of the 
Constitution and section 7 of the Act, 1997, 
therefore, their involvement in getting CMA No.3685 -2012 - 5 - 
financial benefits out of the same by 
indulging in corruption and corrupt practices 
cannot be overruled in view of the discussion 
made herein above. Consequently, they are 
liable to be dealt with under  the  National  
Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  by  the 
NAB;  
(x) All the functionaries of PEPCO, GENCOs, 
PPIB and NEPRA along with sponsors 
(successful bidders) who had derived 
financial benefit s from the RPPs contracts 
are, prima facie, involved in corruption and 
corrupt practices, therefore, they are also 
liable both for the civil and criminal action; 
and 
 (xi) The Chairman NAB is directed to proceed 
against all the persons referred to in 
subpa ragraphs (iii), (ix) and (x) above 
forthwith in accordance with law and submit 
fortnightly progress report to Registrar for 
our perusal in Chambers. ” 
 
2.  We have noticed from time to time on receipt of the 
reports that to comply with the above directions,  progress is not 
being made. However, to achieve the said object , the case was 
adjourned from time to time and ultimately , the Court vide order 
dated 14.9.2012, was compelled to issue notice to the Chairman , 
NAB and the following persons  to show cause as t o why 
contempt proceedings may not be initiated against them , for non 
implementing the Court ’s judgment:  
1. Col (R) Shahzad Anwar Bhatti, DG NAB  
2. Mr. Raza Khan, Director Special Operations Wing  
3. Mr. Zahir Shah, Director Operations Wing  
4. Mr. Muhammad  Rafi, Deputy Director/IO  
5. Mr. Asghar Khan, Deputy Director/IO  
6. Mr. Amir Shahzad, Deputy Director/IO  
7. Mr. Kamran Faisal, Asstt. Director/IO  
  CMA No.3685 -2012 - 6 - 
3.  In response to the notice , they appeared  before this 
Court on 25.9.2012 and it was directed that a compl ete record of 
the inquir ies/investigation s, if any, conducted in accordance with 
each paragraph of the judgment, particularly , keeping in view the 
concluding paragraph of the judgment reproduced above to 
substantiate the plea taken by the officers of the N AB in their 
replies to the Show Cause Notice. O ne of the officers, Col. (R) 
Shahzad Anwar Bhatti came on the rostrum on 1.10.2012 and 
requested for grant of time to implement the judgment in letter 
and spirit . Accordingly, 14-days time was given enabling h im 
and the IOs of the NAB to show substantial progress in the 
matter.  
4.  When the case was taken up on 9.1.2013, Raja Amir 
Abbas, learned ASC appeared alongwith Asghar Khan, IO and 
stated that he has completed the investigation of two cases 
honestly and after completion of investigation, filing of the  
References have been recommended and the reports have been 
received from the Regional Headquarters of NAB but in the 
meanwhile, vide letter dated 7.1.2013 following two orders were 
passed: - 
“a. Mr. Ahmed Ha yat Lak, Advisor NAB HQ 
may be assigned task to support DG 
NAB Rawalpindi on the RPP cases.  
 
b. IO’s under contempt be removed from 
these cases since Supreme Court of CMA No.3685 -2012 - 7 - 
Pakistan also does not appear happy 
with their performance.”  
  
5.  In view of above order , we inquired from the 
Additional Prosecutor General, NAB as to why false and baseless 
attribution has been made in the name of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in item No.(b), reproduced hereinabove.  When  he was 
asked to produce the record on the basis of wh ich such 
observation has been made, as we understand that if notice is not 
taken , NAB Auth orities shall unnecessarily use  the name of the 
Supreme Court without any justification, therefore, he was 
directed that Brig (R) Farooq Nasar Awan, Principal Secreta ry to 
Chairman NAB should appear and produce the record. He stated 
that the l atter was not available in the office. However, he 
procured the record.  He also informed that the record is silent 
about the observation , which has been made and there is 
absolut ely no Reference to any order of the Supreme Court. On 
this, we directed to the Prosecutor General ,  NAB that he should 
put up the complete progress report of each case of RPPs and also 
directed that Brig (R) Farooq Nasar Awan to appear in person 
and expla in as to why action , in this behalf , should not be taken 
against him in accordance with the law. The case was adjourned 
for 10.1.2013 but could not be taken up for want of time as such 
on the following day i.e. on  11.1.2013, the following order was 
passed :-  CMA No.3685 -2012 - 8 - 
“Mr. Fauzi Zafar, learned ADPGA 
stated that he is not feeling well. However, he 
has informed that Col. (R) Subah Sadiq and 
Brig. (R) Shahzad Bhatti have been suspended 
as well as Brig. (R) Farooq Naser Awan, 
Principal Secretary to Chairman NAB (present 
in Court), who signed letter dated 07.01.2013, 
using the expression that the “Supreme Court of 
Pakistan also does not appear happy with their 
performance.”, whereas the IOs are concerned, 
according to his information, they have been 
reinstated. We have enq uired from the learned 
counsel that why the name of the Supreme 
Court is being used falsely for the purpose of 
taking action against the I.Os. and direct the 
learned counsel to produce the original record 
on the basis of which, such directions were 
issued by the Chairman, NAB, as the letter 
mentioned above indicates that in pursuance of 
his directions, the same was issued.  
 
2. In the meanwhile, a comprehensive 
report shall also be prepared in respect of the 
implementation of judgment of this Court dated 
30.03.2012, pointing out the actions taken on 
both sides i.e. civil as well as criminal against 
the persons responsible for the same and if 
there are criminal cases, the references have 
been filed with the explanation as to why so far 
the accused persons hav e not been arrested and 
who is responsible for the same.  
 
3. In the meanwhile, the Chairman, NAB, is 
directed to look into the matter and ensure that 
whoever is the culprit involved in the case, he 
may be dealt with in accordance with the law 
on the crimi nal as well as civil side including by 
effecting recovery of the outstanding amount, 
also.  
 
4. Adjourned to 15.01.2013. ” 
 
7.  It is to be noted that in the concluding para  of the 
above order , the Chairman , NAB was directed to look into matter 
and ensure  that who ever is the culprit involved  in the case, may 
be dealt with in accordance  with the law on the criminal as well CMA No.3685 -2012 - 9 - 
as civil side including by effecting recovery of the outstanding 
amount .  
8.  Accordingly on 15 -1-2013, t he case was taken up and 
the following observations were made :-  
“2. Raja Amir Abbas,  learned counsel 
appearing for the IOs to whom the notices for 
contempt have been issued pointed out that on 
7.1.2013, Brig (R) Farooq Naser Awan, 
Principal Secretary, NAB has issued a letter, 
relevant p ara there from reads as under: - 
 
“b. IO’s under contempt be removed 
from these cases since Supreme Court of 
Pakistan also does not appear happy 
with their performance”  
 
whereas, we were led to believe by the 
Principal Secretary that such action has been 
taken against the IOs, as it has been noted 
hereinabove on the recommendations of the 
DG.”  
 
9.  Col. (R) Subah  Sadiq was also  present in Court and 
stated that on the same day , he had  sent a letter dat ed 7.1.2013 
and he had n ot use d the name of the Supreme  Court,  However, 
upon it , the  Chairman, NAB  passed  an order , para 2 of the same ,  
as relied upon by him has been reproduced hereinabove.  
10.  Brig (R) Farooq Nasar  Awan, placed a copy of order 
with ha ndwritten notes of the Chairman , NAB, referred to 
hereinabove . On this, we have noticed that by using the name of 
the Supreme Court,  both the I.Os. namely, Asghar Khan and 
Kamran Faisal were removed from the cases. Thus, it is 
concluded that none  else except the Chairman , NAB himself use d 
the name of the Sup reme Court for his own motive s and object as CMA No.3685 -2012 - 10 - 
is eviden t from the record refer red to hereina bove. I n respect of 
issuance of  notice earlier to the present proceedings , following 
observations were made :- 
“5. We may clarify here that the Chairman 
NAB is alread y under contempt notice for non 
compliance of the judgment in the RPP Cases 
and copy of the same had been delivered to him 
as back as in the month of March, 2012, 
therefore, he should have been careful, 
however, under the circumstances, we issue 
notice to the Chairman NAB to explain as to 
why he has falsely used the name of the 
Supreme Court with a view to remove the IOs 
namely, Asghar Ali and Kamran Faisal. It is 
added that prima facie above said two IOs 
remained associated with the Investigation 
Reports u nder the supervision of the Col (R) 
Subeh Sadiq, D.G against Raja Parvaiz Ashraf, 
Ex-Minister for Water and Power and 15 others 
in Case No.2(3 -RPP)/SOD/2012/NAB and Mr. 
Shahid Rafi and 21 others in case No.2(4 -RPP) 
/SOD/2012/NAB. ” 
 
 
11.  In the same order , it was made clear to the Chairman, 
NAB  that if any  one of the accused involved in these cases 
succeed s in making good his escape out of the country, he will be 
responsible personally for the same. Relating to finalizing the 
inquiry/invest igation reports i n respect of the case s bearing 
No.2 (3-RPP)/SOD/ 2012 /NAB and case No.2(4 -RPP)/SOD/  
2012/  NAB , following directions were issued.  
 
“6. It is made clear here to the Chairman, 
NAB that if any one accused involved in these 
cases succeed in making good their esc ape out 
of the country, he will be responsible personally 
for the same.  
 
7. It appears that prima facie the 
Investigating Officers are not being allowed to 
ensure the implementation of the judgment of CMA No.3685 -2012 - 11 - 
this Court in letter and spirit, therefore, we 
direct the Additional Prosecutor General, NAB 
that he should undertake all the necessary steps 
during the course of day and submit 
Investigation Reports to the concerned 
authorities and to get approved the 
challans/references  against the accused 
persons and to c ause their arrest without any 
hesitation and put up report on 17.1.2013. ”      
 
 
12.  In response to above direction s, a Report has been 
submitted , which is unsatisfactorily and at this stage , we would 
make reference of following two line s wherein  he has s tated, “the 
allegation s concer ning vio lation of PPRA Rules and increase of 
down payment from 7% to 14% does not stand proved from the 
record ”. It is to be noted that in the judgment  of this Co urt dated 
30th March, 2012, sufficient material was produced on the basis 
of which it stood  established that the payment from  7% to 14% 
was made , therefore, the contentions so ra ised by the Add itional 
Prosecutor General, NAB is absolutely incorrect . In the 
concluding p aras, he observed as follow s: 
 
“For the foregoing r easons and findings I 
recommend that the Interim Investigation 
Reports may be ignored as filing of References 
on those Reports would be embarrassing for 
NAB as it would result in acquittal due to lack 
of sufficient supporting evidence.  
 
I therefore recomme nd that at this stage 
References should not be filed against the 
persons named in the two Interim Investigation 
Reports. However, if subsequently new cogent 
evidence of corruption is uncovered which 
connects any of the said persons to the alleged 
crime und er the NAO then the possibility of 
filing of reference may again be considered. 
Record reveals that all the aforesaid persons CMA No.3685 -2012 - 12 - 
have co -operated throughout the investigation. 
Thus there is no legal justification to arrest 
them but however in order to secure their 
attendance in future, if need be, their names 
except the name of Prime Minister Raja 
Parvaiz Ashraf, may be placed on E.C.L.”  
 
 
13.  We fail to understand the conclusion drawn . In the 
judgment dated 30th March , 2012,  contains sufficient material on 
the basis of which it was concluded that action should be taken 
against the culprits involved in the corruption and corr upt 
practices under N ational Accountability Ordinance , 1999,  the 
relevant observation s have already been reproduced hereinabove . 
14.  In view of the above , we have  strong reservations  
about the manner in which the above Report has b een submitted 
inasmuch as neither the Reference was got approved by the 
Additional Prosecutor General , NAB  and contrary to it he has 
stated that there is no evi dence in the cases in respect of two 
complaints refer red to hereinabove . Therefore, u nder the 
circumstance s, we are left with no option but to issue direction s 
to the Chairman, NAB to produce before us  the investigati on files 
of all the RPPs case s. 
15.  Initially, he raised objection upon the jurisdiction of 
this Court to look into the investigation and stated that it is his 
prerogative and right. The learned Prosecutor General , NAB  has 
also ra ised the same objection in this behalf . We have pointed out 
to the Prosecutor General , NAB  that he may go through the CMA No.3685 -2012 - 13 - 
judgments of this Co urt before making such objection , including  
Bank of Punjab and another v. Haris Steel Industries (Pvt) 
Limited and others  (PLD 2010 SC 1109 ), the relevant para 28 , is 
reproduced herei n below :- 
“28. Be that as it may, a perusal of the said 
cited judgment which emanated from a learned 
Bench of this Court comprising two Honourable 
Members, would reveal that the only reason 
which had weighed with the said learned Bench 
in reaching the abov e conclusion was the 
judgment delivered by the Privy Council in 
Khawaja Nazir's case reported as AIR 1945 PC 
18. Suffice it to say that what was in issue in the 
said Khawaja Nazir's case was an intervention 
by the Lahore High Court in the purported 
exercis e of its powers under section 561 -A of 
the Cr.P.C. which provision of law authorized 
the High Court "to make such orders as may be 
necessary to give effect to any, order under this 
Code; or to prevent abuse of process of any 
court or otherwise to secure en ds of justice." 
Needless to add that unlike the situation 
obtaining in the year, 1945 and earlier, this 
Court and the High Court now stand vested 
with extraordinary powers available under 
Article 199 of the Constitution which are not 
limited to the bounds of the above -noticed sub -
constitutional 'provision of section, 561 -A, 
Cr.P.C. Nor was the said case of Khawaja 
Nazir Ahmed one where the jurisdiction of a 
High Court had been invoked or exercised in 
defence of an aggression against the 
fundamental rights o f the public at large. 
Therefore, the dictum laid down in Khawaja 
Nazir's case was not applicable to the present 
situation and seeking its application to the facts 
and circumstances of the present case was 
misplaced. While we are on the subject, we 
would l ike to refer to a judgment of this Court 
delivered in the case of Advocate. General 
Sindh v. Farman Hussain and others PLD 1995 
SC 1 which judgment was then cited with 
approval in a recent judgment of this Court, 
namely, Zahid Imran and others v. The State  
and others (PLD 2006 SC 109). The principle 
which had been highlighted in the said 
judgments was that they/approach of a Court of CMA No.3685 -2012 - 14 - 
law while dealing with criminal matters had to 
be dynamic keeping in view the facts and 
circumstances of each case and also t he 
surrounding situation obtaining in the country. 
The relevant passage reads as under:  
 "This Court in more than one case has held 
that the approach of the Court while 
considering criminal matters should be dynamic 
and it should take into consideration th e 
surrounding situation obtaining in the country 
…….."  
In view of the facts and circumstances of the 
present case summarized above, it would have 
been felonious and unconscionable on the part 
of this Court if it had refused to intervene to 
defend the funda mental rights of such a large 
section of the public and leaving it only to the 
concerned officials of the NAB who had done 
nothing at all in the matter for almost TWO 
YEARS; who had remained only the silent 
spectators of this entire drama and had only 
witnessed the escape of the accused persons to 
foreign lands. It is to check and cater for such 
kind of gross negligence, non -feasance and 
malfeasance that the framers of the Constitution 
had obligated the High Court under Article 199 
and this Court under Arti cle 184(3) of the 
Constitution to intervene in the matter 
exercising their power to review administrative 
and executive actions. This is then what the 
Constitution had expected of this Court through 
its Article 184(3) and this is exactly what this 
Court ha d done. ” 
and the case titled Corruption in Hajj Arrangements in 2010  
(PLD 2011 SC 963), relevant para 30 , is reproduced herein 
below :- 
“30. Our own judgment in the case of Bank of 
Punjab v. Haris Steel (PLD 2010 SC 1109) highlights 
the jurisdiction and pow ers of this Court. Relevant 
paras therefrom  are reproduced herein  below: - 
 
"26. In questioning the jurisdiction of this 
Court, Mr. Irfan Qadir, the learned Prosecutor 
General for the NAB submitted, as has been 
noticed above, that this Court had no 
jurisdic tion to control investigation of a CMA No.3685 -2012 - 15 - 
criminal case and the reason offered by him in 
support of the said submission was that such a 
control over the Investigation of a criminal case 
by this Court could be "PREJUDICIAL TO 
THE ACCUSED." The only judgment cited by 
him to buttress his said plea was the case of 
Malik Shaukat Dogar and 12 others v. Ghulam 
Qasim Khan Khakwani and others (PLD 1994 
SC 281).  
28……Therefore, the dictum laid down in 
Khawaja Nazir's case was not applicable to the 
present situation and seeki ng its application to 
the facts and circumstances of the present case 
was misplaced. While we are on the subject, we 
would like to refer to a judgment of this Court 
delivered in the case of Advocate General Sindh 
v. Farman Hussain and others PLD 1995 SC 1 
which judgment was then cited with approval in 
a recent judgment of this Court, namely, Zahid 
Imran and others v. The State and others (PLD 
2006 SC 109). The principle which had been 
highlighted in the said judgments was that 
they/approach of a Court of la w while dealing 
with criminal matters had to be dynamic 
keeping in view the facts and circumstances of 
each case and also the surrounding situation 
obtaining in the country. ... In view of the facts 
and circumstances of the present case 
summarized above, i t would have been 
felonious and unconscionable on the part of this 
Court if it had refused to intervene to defend the 
fundamental rights of such a large section of 
the public and leaving it only to the concerned 
officials of the NAB who had done nothing at  all 
in the matter for almost TWO YEARS; who had 
remained only the silent spectators of this entire 
drama and had only witnessed the escape of the 
accused persons to foreign lands. It is to check 
and cater for such kind of gr oss negligence, 
non-feasance an d. malfeasance that the framers 
of the Constitution had obligated the High 
Court under Article 199 and this Court under 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution to intervene in 
the matter exercising their power to review 
administrative and executive actions. Thi s is 
then what the Constitution had expected of this 
Court through its Article 184(3) and this is 
exactly what this Court had done.  
29. It may be mentioned here that in order to 
ensure peace in a society, the laws are required 
to keep pace with the changin g times and as has 
been noticed above with reference to the case of CMA No.3685 -2012 - 16 - 
Advocate -General, Sindh (supra) even the 
approach of the courts has to be dynamic 
keeping in view the ever -changing ground 
realities. It. was for this very reason that even 
in the matter o f investigations, a role was 
carved for the courts by addition of subsection 
(6) in section 22 -A of the Cr.P.C. through the 
Amending Ordinance No. CXXXI of 2002 of 
which provisions,. the learned Prosecutor -
General appears to be ignorant. A reference 
may al so be made to a judgment delivered by a 
17 Member Bench of this Court in Mubashir 
Hasan's case (PLD 2010 SC 265) especially to 
the discussion on the question of investigation 
as contained in para 102 thereof ……..   
30………Investigation, therefore, means 
nothi ng more than collection of evidence. 
Needless to say that it is evidence and evidence 
alone which could lead a court of law to a just 
and fair conclusion about the guilt or innocence 
of an accused person. It is, therefore, only an 
honest investigation whic h could guarantee a 
fair trial and conceiving a fair trial in the 
absence of an impartial and a just investigation 
would be a mere illusion and a mirage. It is, 
hence, only a fair investigation which could 
assure a fair trial and thus any act which 
ensures  a clean investigation which is above 
board, is an act in aid of securing the said 
guaranteed right and not in derogation thereof. 
However, before we part with this aspect of the 
matter, we may add that if the learned counsel 
had cared t o go through variou s orders passed 
by this Court in the main Constitution Original 
Petition No.39 of 2009, he would have 
discovered that the said orders were restricted 
only to ensuring that the investigating agency 
did what it was required by law to do; did it 
honestly, fai rly and efficiently; did not sleep 
over the matter as it had done for almost TWO 
YEARS and that not a word had been said by 
this Court about what evidence to collect and 
what evidence not to collect or about the worth 
or veracity of the collected evidence. " 
16.  Besides the above mentioned judgments, there is 
ample case law on the point which we will be discussing  later on 
after hearing the learned Prosecutor General , NAB,  however, at CMA No.3685 -2012 - 17 - 
this stage , we direct the Chairman , NAB who is present in Court, 
to furni sh a comprehensive Report from the date of 
commencement  of the invest igatin g/inquiry  in all the RPP s case s, 
both solicited  and unsoli cited to which reference has already been 
made in detail. In pursuance of our direction, the record has been 
brought but it  is already 5.00 p.m., therefore, it is not possible to 
commence hearing  further , hence, we adjourn this case for 
23.1.2013 and will be taken up at 1.00 p.m.  
 
 
           Chief Justice   
  
 
 
        Judge
