JUDGMENT  
MIAN SAQIB NISAR, J. - 
1. The facts of this case though hotly disputed are  relatively uncomplicated. Under 
challenge is the Signal Free Corridor Project (the “Project”). The Lahore 
Development Authority (“LDA”) , a statutory authority established by the 
Government of Punjab (“GoP b”), is “introducing ” two underpasses, 7 U -turns 
and 5 overhead pedestrian bridges on an existing 7.1 kms  of the existing Jail 
Road and Main Boulevard.  It starts from Q urtaba  Chowk (roundab out) and ends 
at Liberty Market Main Chowk. According to the judgment of the High Court, 
this remodeling would convert this stretch into “a signal free, high speed 
expressway”.  
 
2. These appeals arise out of a judgment of the Full Bench of the Lahore High 
Court in 3 Writ Petitions. CAs No.545, 547 and 548 of 2015 have been filed by 
LDA against the common judgment in 3 Writ Petitions. CAs No.546, 549 and 
550 of 2015 have been filed by GoP b.  
 
3. Writ Petition No. 5323/2015: “Fahad Malik etc. v. Government of Punja b, etc.” 
was filed to challenge the Project. The Petitioners in the Writ Petition alleged 
that the Project required the cutting down of a large number of trees, an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”)  was mandatory from the 
Environmental Protection Agen cy, Punjab, (“EPA”) prior to the commencement 
of the Project and that the Project fell within Serial N o.2 of Part -D of Schedule -
II of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Review of IEE & EIA) 
Regulations, 2000.  The Project was called into question  alleging that it would 
result in severe environmental degradation, it was  irrational and discriminatory 
and violated  Articles 37, 38 and 140A  of the Constitution.  
 
4. That on 26 February 2015 and 6 March 2015 the High Court granted restraining 
orders, which  had the effect of stopping all work on the Project. The High Court 
directed that the EPA complete the EIA review and place its decision before the 
Court on 20 March 2015.  
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  3 
 5. The EPA issued Public Notices in the press. It conducted a public hearing. The 
private respondents in these appeals participated in the process. After the 
completion of this process, the EIA approval was granted by EPA on 19 March 
2015.  
 
6. In the hearing of 20 March 2015 the Appellants GoP b and LDA argued that as 
the Project had been appr oved by EPA, the restraining orders be vacated. The 
High Court, however, directed the EPA to submit before it the entire record 
forming the basis of the EIA approval. It also directed that the record of the 
deliberations, which formed the basis of the EIA approval, and the detailed 
reasons dealing with the objections raised against the Project during the Public 
Hearing be submitted.  
 
7. On 20 March 2015 Writ Petition No. 7955/2015 and Writ Petition No. 
8008/2015  were also taken up for hearing. The former chall enged the vires of 
several provisions of the LDA Act, 1975. The grievances included usurpation of 
Local Government functions enumerated in section 87 Punjab Local 
Government Act, 2013 (“PLGA 2013”). It was alleged that the democratic rights 
of the citizens  of Lahore Division and the democratic functions of the Local 
Government of that area were usurped by the GoP b through the LDA Act, 1975 
and by the unconstitutional exercise of executive powers . That besides violating 
the Fundamental Rights of the Petition ers the Project also violated, inter alia , 
Article 140A of the Constitution.  
 
8. In Writ Petition 8008 of 2015 besides making allegations similar to those in Writ 
Petition No. 7955 of 2015, it was submitted that the approval granted by the 
Punjab EPA was ille gal and violated the provisions of the Punjab Environment 
Protection Act 1997 (“PEPA”).  
 
9. That a full bench of the Lahore High Court after hearing arguments accepted 
these petitions, struck down Sections 6, 13, 13A, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 28, 
34A, 34B,  35, 38 and 46 of the LDA Act, 1975 as ultra vires  the Objectives 
Resolution, Articles 2A, 4, 9, 14, 17 and 25 of the Constitution and as offensive 
to Articles 32, 37 (i) and 140A of the Constitution. The Project was stopped and 
the National Accountability  Bureau (NAB) was directed to initiate an inquiry 
against DG, LDA and DG , EPA.  
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  4 
 10. That while detailed submission s were made before the High Court on the flaws 
of the Project and about its justification and rationale , the High Court declined to 
examine these issues.  
 
11. According to the impugned judgment t he “merits or demerits of the Project ” and 
the “ rationality and justification for having such a Project ” were not examined 
by the High Court. The “ policy dimension of the Project or the technical 
viability of t he Project ” was also not examined. It was made clear by the High 
Court that it was “ neither assuming the role of EPA or stepping into the shoes of 
the consultant who prepared the EIA or the concerned members of the civil 
society who, inter alia, opposed th e Project on the ground of misplaced, 
inappropriate and irrational allocation of public funds. ” 
 
12. The preliminary objections to the maintainability of the petitions and the 
inappropriate nature of the judicial review jurisdiction to examine questions of 
fact were overruled as the Court considered itself concerned with deciding 
constitutional questions that went to the root of the definition of democracy and 
federalism under the Constitution.  
 
13. Mr. Khwaja Haris Ahmed, Senior ASC arguing for the Appellant LDA divided 
his submissions in four part:  
 
a) That the High Court should not have interfered in the matter as adequate 
alternative remedies were available to the Petitioners in the form of an appeal 
to a statutory tribunal constituted under PEPA.  
 
b) That in the exe rcise of its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution the High Court should have exercised judicial restraint.   
 
c) Such restraint should normally be exercised in policy matters.   
 
d) That the judgment of the High Court was vitiated by the bias of the senior 
member of the full bench.  
 
14. Elaborating his submissions he urged  that the PC I of the project should have 
been read with its EIA. Article 140A of the Constitution cannot dilute provincial 
legislative and executive powers.  He submitte d that the reliance of the High C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  5 
 Court on the doctrine of regulatory capture was misplaced. He further submitted 
that to the extent of inconsistency between the LDA Act and the PLGA , the 
former prevailed and the LDA Act impliedly repealed provisions of PLGA .  He 
further submitted that the non -obstante clause in the L DA Act made it override 
the PLGA .  That Local Government elections  were  yet to be held ; therefore a 
vacuum existed which was rightly filled by the LDA Act, 1975.    
 
15. He submitted that an appeal fr om the decision of PEPA was provided to the 
Environmental Tribunal headed by a former judge of the High Court and a 
second appeal was provided to a Division Bench of the High Court itself.  An 
adequate remedy was available to the Petitioners and the High C ourt should not 
have issued the writs.  He submitted that the concept of regulatory capture was 
not attracted to the case.  The mere fact that appointments in the EPA were made 
by the GoPb  does not suggest that there was regulatory capture.  This was 
particularly so when there was no evidence on the record nor finding by the 
Court to suggest that such a defect ha d occurred .  He submitted that legislation 
should not be struck down on vague concepts  like subsidiarity.  
 
16. The learned Senior  ASC  submitted that ev en the judgment conceded that in spite 
of promulgation of PLGA the Provincial Government  retained certain minimum 
functions.  That without these the Provincial Government  would become 
completely ineffective.  
 
17. Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan , Senior ASC adopted the arguments of Mr. Khwaja 
Haris Ahmed with a caveat that he was not adopting or pursuing the bias 
argument. He subm itted that the remarks against the  learned Senior ASC be 
expunged and that the matter should rest there. He argued that Article 140A did 
not di vest the Provincial Government  of its legislativ e or executive authority . 
Articles 137, 142 and 140A of the Constitution have to be harmoniously 
construed.  
 
18. Mr. Shahid  Hamid , Senior  ASC appearing for the Project Contractor submitted a 
plan giving details of the proposed project along with cost summary.  
 
19. He submitted that the notable features of the project are:  
(i) Existing right -of-way of the Main Boulevard is 200 feet wide while that 
of Jail Road is 150 feet wide. The project is being executed within the 
existing rights -of-way.  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  6 
 (ii) There will be no increase in the number of lanes. Main Boulevard has 
six lanes. Jail Road has six lanes. These numbers will remain 
unchanged.  
(iii) The service roads on either side of the Main Boulevard and along the 
Jail Road will remain a s they are.  
(iv) The medians along the Main Boulevard and the Jail Road will remain 
intact. Width of the median on the Main Boulevard from Zahoor Elahi  
road crossing to the Main Market will increase from 15 feet to 40 feet.  
(v) There are 8 traffic signals between Qurtaba  Chow k and Liberty Market 
roundabout. As a result of the project these will be replaced with 9 U -
turns and 2 underpasses.  
(vi) 196 trees have to be cut. These will be replaced with 1300 trees.  
(vii) Existing green areas along the two roads is 160 kanals. This w ill 
increase to 182 canals.  
(viii) Air and noise pollution will decrease while traffic congestion will be 
greatly eased.  
(ix) The project is manifestly in the public interest and its impact on the 
environment will be positive and not adverse.  
20. Mr. S hahid  Hamid submitt ed that the project was included in the approved 
Integrated Master Plan 2021 for Lahore. It was included in the approved budget 
of the LDA for 2013 -14. It has since been approved by the EPA also. The 
alleged irregularity involved in announcing the project without EPA clearance 
has thus been cured.  He forcefully added that in  fact there was no irregularity 
because as per entry at serial N o.2 of Part -D of Schedule -II of the Pakistan 
Environmental Protection Agency Review of Initial Environmental Examination 
and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 2000 projects for 
maintenance, rebuilding or reconstruction of existing roads do not require an 
EIA. The m eaning of ’rebuild ’ includes “ to make important improvements or 
changes in ”. The Meaning of “reconstruc t” includes “ to remodel and/or to make 
changes so as to make it the work more effectively .”  
 
21. Mr. Raza Kazim , Sr. ASC leading the arguments for the Respondent s submitted 
that the questions relating to the project were of secondary nature and the 
decision o f the case did not depend on them.  He submitted that the validity of 
the EIA appro val, regulatory capture, the merits of the project and flaws in the 
process were not germane to the controversy. He referred to Black’s Law 
Dictionary for the definition of the term “ devolution ” and submitted that he who C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  7 
 devolves dies and the one upon whom authority is devolved is the only living 
institution. He submitted that after the insertion of the Article 140A in the 
Constitution all the political, administrative and fi nancial responsibility and 
authority of the Province  were devolved on the Local Government.  In none of 
these matters the Province  was left with any legislative or executive authority. 
All such authority had passed to the Local Government. There cannot eve n be a 
sharing of the authority between the governments.  
 
22. Mr. Mehmood Ahmed Mirza , ASC supported the judgment of the Lahore High 
Court.  He submitted that the constitutional issue was correctly decided by the 
High Court. He further submitted that the proje ct violated the provisi ons of the 
LDA Act because it  was repugnant to the Master Plan. Any project which was 
not in consonance with the Master Plan could not be upheld.  He submitted that 
the project was malafide.  He further submitted that Article 140A of  the 
Constitution was an enabling provision and envisaged a third tier of the 
government. He also submitted that the process through which EIA was 
approved was neither meaningful nor transparent. The project was not in the 
public interest and would not res ult in the development of the city.  
 
23. Mr. Salman Akram Raja , ASC  in support of the judgment submitted that Article 
140A of the Constitution is a paradigm shift whereby the executive, 
administrative and financial authority of the Province  has been bifurcated  
between the provincial and the Local Government.  He disagreed with Mr. Mirza 
that Article 140A was an enabling provision. He submitted that p rior to Article 
140A the Province  had executive authority under Article 137 o f the Constitution.  
Now, that  is di vided between the provincial and Local Governments. He 
submitted that one type of executive authority (LDA  Provincial Government ) 
could not take over the function s of the other kind of executive authority  (Local 
Government) simply because there was a vacuu m. He traced the history of the 
Local Government in the subcontinent in great detail and submitted that 
activities which earlier were Provincial Government  functions were now in the 
Local Government’s domain .  He submitted that on the basis of a historic 
reading of the functions of the Local Government, except for spillovers and 
economies of scale all executive function s were local.  In this context 
urban/ spatial planning were Local Government functions.  
 
24. He questioned why the government was spending the m assive sum of Rs. 1.5 
billion on th e signal free corridor  project . He submitted that insofar as the entire C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  8 
 discussion in the judgment on regulatory capture was concerned that was 
unnecessary and perhaps irrelevant.  All that was argued before the learned 
judges of the full bench was that the DG EPA was one person and he should not 
alone be allowed to exercise the statutory powers vested in PEPA . 
 
25. The above account merely adumbrates what was argued over the course of days. 
The details are  in our analysis of the issues. Setting it all out here in great detail 
would add to the length of the judgment unnecessarily. It would also be tedious 
and repetitious.  We may add that before us, l engthy submissions with copious 
references to case law have been made by the co unsel for the parties  over the 
course of many days . Besides these submissions we have had the benefit of 
detailed pleadings and have examined the documents on the  record . We have 
carefully considered every argument raised, and all materials and record  
addu ced by all the Parties.  We have  chosen, however, not to set out a lengthy 
account  of each side’s case in this judgment , but instead  have in the course of 
the analysis below , simply summarise d some of the principal points. In so far as 
any argument or docu ment  which has not been specifically identified or 
recorded in the body of this judgment , this does not mean it has not been taken 
into full consideration.   
 
26. The first and pivotal question that concerns this Court is whether the High Court 
was justified i n striking down several provisions of the LDA Act, 1975 on the 
touchstone of Article 140A read with Fundamental Rights, Article 9, 14, 17 and 
25 of the Constitution as well as Articles 32 and 37(i) thereof.  During the 
hearing of the appeals counsel on both  sides of the divide candidly 
acknowledged that this indeed was the heart of the matter.  
 
27. That the analysis of the High Court on the scope of Article 140A, its role in our 
constitutional scheme and the vires of the various provisions of the LDA Act, 
1975 is contained in para graphs 48 to 99 of the judgment.  These observations 
can be summarized as follows:  
 
i. The principle of subsidiarity requires that decisions be taken at the lowest 
permissible level (paragraphs 73, 74, and 83 of the judgment). Local 
Govern ment being at such a level ought  to be given core functions 
(paragraph 59 of the judgment) by the provincial legislature (paragraphs 
68 and 71 of the judgment). Section 87 of the PLGA 2013 confers such 
functions on the Local Government (paragraph 86 of the  judgment). These 
functions cannot be “ stripped ”; “reversed ” or “ rolled back ” without C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  9 
 challenging the “ legislative design ” of Article 140A (paragraphs 71, 77, 78 
and 89 of the judgment).  
 
ii. There are only three exceptions to the rule against “stripping ”, “reversal ” 
or “roll back ” of devolved  function s. These are: (a) ineffectiveness of the 
Local Government; (b) spill  overs; and (iii) economies of scale 
(paragraphs 75, 82, and 88 of the judgment).  
 
iii. Subject to the above three exceptions the provincial framework  has to 
conform to Article 140A as this is the “ basic architecture ”/“basic 
structure ” of the Local Government (paragraphs 76 and 89 of the 
judgment).  
 
iv. Section 4(1) of PLGA 2013 which requires the Local Government to 
“function  within the provincial framewo rk” and to “ faithfully observe the 
Federal and Provincial laws ” means that the Local Government will be 
complemented by the Provincial framework. It does not mean that the 
Province  can impede, interfere or dilute the powers or functions of the 
Local Govern ment. These functions will be exercised by the Local 
Government to the exclusion of the Provincial Government  (paragraphs 
76, 79 and 89 of the judgment).  
 
v. The legislative powers under Articles 142 and 143 of the Constitution are 
to be exercised “ Subject t o the Constitution ”, which means that the 
remainder of the Constitution has to be considered. That would include: 
(a) Federalism; (b) Objectives Resolution; (c) Principles of Policy; (d) 
Article 140A of the Constitution  and (e) Fundamental R ights,  Articles  9, 
14, 17 and 25 (paragraph 91 of the judgment). No Provincial or Federal 
law can impede the Local Government (paragraph 97 of the judgment).  
 
vi. LDA Act, 1975 offends Article 140A. Section 6, 13, 13A, 14, 15, 16, 18, 
20, 23, 24, 28, 34A, 34B, 35, 38 and 46  of the LDA Act were, therefore, 
struck down (paragraphs 95, 96 and 97). Likewise the executive authority 
of the Provincial Government , in the absence of legislation, cannot extend 
to Local Government affairs (paragraph 92 of the judgment).  
 
28. That  encourag ing the growth of the Local Government institutions and 
decentralization of the Government administration are Principles of Policy under 
Articles 32 and 37(i) of the Constitution . However, t he validity of an action or of C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  10 
 a law cannot be called into questio n on this basis in view of Article 30 (2) of the 
Constitution:  
 
I. Zulfiqar Ali Babu v. Government of Punjab; PLD 1997 SC 11 at page 22B  
 
II. Farhat  Jaleel v. Province  of Sindh; PLD 1990 Karachi 342 (DB) at page 
354 E  
 
III. Ghulam Mustafa v. Province  of Sindh; 2010 CL C 1383 (Karachi HC) (DB) 
at page 1391 B  
 
IV. Shazia  Irshad  Bokhari v. Government of Punjab; PLD 2005 Lahore 428 
(DB) at page 434 D.  
 
29. That although the Objectives Resolution has been made a substantive part of the 
Constitution by Article 2A, this Court has held  that Article 2A cannot be used to 
strike down statu tes: 
 
I.   Kaniz Fatima v. Wali Muhammad; PLD 1993 SC 901 at paras. 8 and 9;  
 
II. Tank Steel and Re -Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd. V. Federation of Pakistan, (PLD 
1996 SC 77)  at 84 E;  
 
III. Zulfiqar Ali Babu v. Government o f Punjab; PLD 1997 SC 11 at 22C;  
 
IV. The Province  of Punjab v. National Industrial Cooperative Credit 
Corporation; 2000 SCMR 567 at 606 F  
 
30. Article 4 has also not been accepted as a criterion to test the vires of legislation:  
 
Fauji Foundation v. Shamimur Rehm an; PLD 1983 SC 457 at 595 -7, paras. 153 
to 156  
 
31. Indeed, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution 
this Court has observed that it can read the Objectives Resolution, Article 2A 
and the Principles of Policy together with Fundamental Rights:  
 
I.      Pakistan Muslim League (N) v. Federation of Pakistan; PLD 2007 SC 642 
at 670 – 671 J;  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  11 
  
II. Human rights case; 1993 SCMR 2001 at 2004 A;  
 
III. Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan; PLD 1988 SC 416 at Page 489;  
 
32. This does not, however, m ean that the Principles of Policy, the Objectives 
Resolution,  and Article 2A either on their own or when read together can be 
used to strike down laws. All that it means is that these Articles can be used to 
understand and interpret the chapter on Fundamen tal Rights in its proper 
context. This may facilitate an interpretation of Fundamental Rights  in harmony 
with and not divorced from their constitutional setting. The object  of this 
approach is  to harmoniously construe the various provisions of the Constitu tion 
in a holistic manner. This approach does not deviate from the view taken by the 
Court that the Objectives Resolution, Article 2A and the Principles of Policy 
cannot provide a criterion to test the validity of statutes and to strike them down . 
 
33. With th e introduction of Article 140A in the Constitution , the establishment of a 
system of Local Government is no longer a Principle of Policy. The Constitution 
mandates that each Province  shall, by law, establish a Local Government System 
and devolve political,  administrative and financial responsibility and authority to 
the elected representatives of the Local Government. Following this command 
of the Constitution, the Provincial Assembly of Punjab has enacted PLGA 2013. 
In like manner the Provincial Assemblies  of Balochistan, KPK and Sindh have 
also enacted the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act, 2012 and Sindh Local Government Act, 
2013, respectively.  
 
34. Section 72 of the PLGA 2013 lists the functions of the Union Cou ncils. Sections 
76 and 77 list the functions of the District Councils. The functions of the 
Municipal Committees are listed in Section 81 and the functions of the 
Metropolitan and Municipal Corporations are listed in Section 87. Section 65 
provides that th e Provincial Government  may also devolve one or more of its 
functions to the Local Government. Section 148 provides that notwithstanding 
any spe cific provision of the PLGA , the Local Government shall also perform 
the functions listed in the Eighth Schedule . This Schedule lists as many as 105 
general powers of Local Governments.  Read in an expansive manner these 
functions can virtually trump the Provincial Government . It would be left with 
little to do except perhaps to enact legislation further broadening t hese functions.  
This Court does not favour an interpretation which would reduce the role of the C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  12 
 Provincial Government  to that of a mere cipher. It would eschew a course which 
makes Article 137 of the Constitution redundant  by severing the link between 
the extent of executive authority of a Province  to the matters subject to its 
legislative authority.  
35. At the same time if Article 140A  is not to be a merely hollow constitutional 
promise the Provincial Government  is obliged to devolve, by law, some 
political, administrative and financial responsibility on the Local Government. 
This much is beyond doubt. This Court is not inclined to hold that Article 140A 
is an exercise in futility and the Provincial Government  continues to retain the 
same wide legislative and executive authority that it did before its insertion. The 
question is where to draw the line . 
 
36. Articles 137 and 140A have to be read in harmony. Neither overrides the other. 
These prov isions provide a scheme for a representative government and 
participator y democracy in the country. These provide a scheme to establish 
Local Government and articulate a framework within which the Provincial 
Government  must function. The authority conferred on the Province  and the 
responsibilities devolved on the Local Governm ent form part of a common 
scheme . These are not to be used as trumps. One cannot cancel the other. These 
are co-equal norms. They weave the constitutional fabric.  
 
37. We are also acutely conscious of the fact that the other three Province s have also 
enacted Local Government legislation. They too have listed the functions of the 
Local Government in their respective statutes. The four Provincial statu tes may 
not be identical but are similar in many  respects.  The other three Provincial 
Government s are not repres ented in this case. Our interpretation  of the 
Constitution will bind those Province s as well. We must, therefore, decide this 
case on the narrowest possible ground. The issues which are not germane to this 
controversy must be left to be decided in a case w here these are determinative 
for the controversy.  Constitutional cases, even otherwise, must be decided on the 
narrowest possible grounds. Keeping these principles in sight we proceed to 
examine the statutory and constitutional provisions.  
 
38. Section 87 of t he PLGA 2013 lists the functions of the Metropolitan and 
Municipal Corporations. The High Court in paragraph 86 of the judgment 
expressed the view that this provision clearly delineated “ the devolved core 
functions and responsibilities of the Local Governm ent (LMC) ”. 
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  13 
 39. That these functions cannot be “ stripped ” (paragraph 78) and that the Provincial 
Government  cannot “ take any step that reverses or rolls back ” (paragraph 89) 
these functions.  That any interference in this, “ political, administrative and 
financ ial space of the Local Government System, would be undemocratic ” and 
once the devolution has taken place, “ any interference or dilution of this power 
by the Provincial Government  or any other authority, without there being any 
change in the legislative des ign, which draws its power under Article 140A ” 
would be impermissible. That these basic core functions read with Article 140A 
of the Constitution provide the “ basic architecture ” (paragraph 76)  and “ basic 
structure ” (paragraph 89) of the Local Government S ystem, which cannot be 
stripped, reversed or rolled back.  
 
40. This effectively means that once a Provincial Government  has enacted a statute 
devolv ing certain basic functions on the Local Government it loses its powers to 
amend the Provincial law . These prov isions become unamendable. These 
functions cannot be abridge d or curtail ed. They can only be expanded.  The 
constitutionally conferred legis lative authority of  the Provincial Assembly to 
amend the law, with regard to Local Government, can only be exercised to 
enhance and not to curtail the functions of the Local Government.  
 
41. This is an interpretation which we cannot endorse in spite of the fact that we 
accept that the Local Government must have meaningful powers under the 
PLGA 2013 . We also  find it difficul t to accept the interpretation  that once such 
powers or functions are conferred by a provincial law, the Provincial Assembly 
is denuded of the power to amend this law except in a particular manner. It is 
impermissible to so curtail or limit the legislative  authority of the Province  in 
Local Government matters. Constitutions must be interpreted with an eye to the 
future. These are living documents. The future may throw up issues which 
require legislative intervention. The functions and responsibilities of th e Local 
and Provincial Government s may require further articulation. This Court cannot 
today rule that irrespective of the circumstances, which may compel such 
modification or the political realities of the day that may require a re -think , the 
Province  would have no legislative authority in the matter . 
 
42. It is well settled that the legislature of today cannot enact a law or pass a 
resolution, which binds a successor legislature. Such a commitment made either 
through a resolution or legislation, whereby the p owers of a future legislature to 
amend a law are abridged will not bind a successor Legislature or even the same 
Legislature. This is black letter  constitutional law. If any authority is required for C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  14 
 this it can be found in  Re: Special Reference under Arti cle 187 of the Interim 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan by President Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto; PLD 1973 SC 563 at 576 J : 
 
The form of the resolution proposed to be placed before the House, 
itself contemplates that legal and constitutional measur es may be 
necessary to give effect to the object sought to be achieved. It is for this 
reason that a “firm assurance” is being sought from the assembly. No 
violation for any provision of the Constitution is, therefore, even 
contemplated. Such an assurance too will be nothing more than a pious 
wish, for legally it would not bind any future Parliament or present 
Parliament, for when the legislative measure or constitutional 
amendment is brought before a House, the House will be free to 
consider it uninhibited  by any assurance it may have given earlier. No 
Legislature can legally abrogate its sovereign right to legislate as and 
when a legislative measure is brought before it in the light of its own 
provisions. The Legislature cannot be bound by any previous pro mise 
or assurance to legislate in a particular manner. Such a promise or 
assurance will neither be legally binding nor enforceable.  (Emphasis 
Supplied).  
 
43. Such an interpretation would lead to difficulties  in working of a republican 
government . It may give undemocratic results. A political party in majority in a 
Provincial Assembly as well as the Local Bodies when faced with imminent 
defeat in a forthcoming political election may devolve all political, 
administrative and financial responsibility and authority  to the Local 
Government. Another political party, which wins the Provincial elections and 
forms the Provincial Government  would be faced with a situation where all its 
powers have been devolved on the Local Government. It would be left with no 
political, administrative or financial functions or responsibilities. Its role would 
have been reduced to that of a mere facilitator of the Local Government. Yet, it 
would be unable to amend the Local Government legislation, reducing the 
powers of the Local Governmen t and conferring some authority on itself. The 
defeated political party and the outgoing government would, thus, have denied it 
the fruits of its success in the provincial elections. It would have no authority be 
it political, administrative or financial t o run the affairs on the Provincial plane.  
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  15 
 44. The interpretation of the High Court that once the core functions have been 
devolved on the Local Government these cannot be “ rolled back ” (in other 
words amended) , cannot, therefore, be sus tained .  
 
45. Such a n amen dment in the functions or responsibilities can take place by 
amending the PLGA 2013. This can also be done by enacting or amending other 
laws which have the effect of trimming the PLGA 2013. To state that while the 
Provincial Legislature may take the forme r route it cannot take the latter is to 
restrict the legislature in the mode and manner of the exercise of its legislative 
powers. This would result in defeating the substance. In the absence of a 
constitutional command to the contrary, a Court cannot read  such limitations 
into the exercise of legislative authority.  
 
46. The High Court, too, acknowledged that such provincial legislation cannot be 
immutable in all circumstances. In paragraphs 75, 82 and 88 of the impugned 
judgment, it was observed that the Provi ncial Government  can perform the 
functions and exercise the authority devolved on the Local Government in three 
situations:  
 
I.        When the Local Government lacked capacity or was ineffective;  
 
II. When the function was of a nature which spilled over from the  territory of 
one Local Government into that of another; and  
 
III. When economies of scale justified such intervention.  
 
47. That there may be other circumstances in which a Provincial Government  may 
be compelled to act were not countenanced by the High Court.  
 
48. The High Court, therefore, interpreted even Section 4(1) of PLGA 2013, which 
required the Local Government to “ function within the Provincial framework ” 
and to “ faithfully observe the Federal and Provincial laws ” to mean that the 
Local Government could only be complemented by the framework of Provincial 
legislation. The Province , according to the impugned judgment had no authority 
to impede, interfere or dilute the powers or the functions of the Local 
Government. These functions were to be exercised by the Lo cal Government to 
the exclusion of the Provincial Government . (paragraphs 76, 79 and 89)  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  16 
  
49. If this were so once the Province  had exercised its legislative authority to 
devolve certain political, administrative or financial functions or authority on the 
Loca l Government its legislative and executive authority would be 
correspondingly abridged. If political, administrative and financial powers were 
devolved to the fullest extent, the Province  would be left with no legislative or 
executive authority. It would a lso lose the means to recoup such authority by 
legislation.  This would mean that once a Provincial Legislature conferred the 
full panoply of political, administrative and financial responsibility on the Local 
Government, its own constitutional, legislative  and executive authority would be 
taken  over  by that of the Local Government now and forever.  The impractical 
results that it may lead to and the constitutional principles against which such an 
interpretation runs have already been identified by us.  
 
50. The High Court was of the view that Articles 142 and 137 of the Constitution, 
being prefaced by the words “ Subject to the Constitution ” mean that the 
remainder of the Constitution had to be considered (paragraph 91). That these 
Articles would be subordinated t o all those provisions which were not so 
prefaced. Article 140A, not being prefaced by such words, the legislative and 
executive constitutional authority of the Province  would be subject to the 
principles of Federalism, Objectives Resolution, Principles of  Policy, 
Fundamental Rights, 9, 14, 17 and 25 and Article 140A of the Constitution. As a 
result no provincial or federal law could impede Local Government (paragraph 
97). 
 
51. This interpretation gives too wide a scope to the words “ Subject to the 
Constitution ”. In Muhammad Khan v. The Border Allotment Committee; PLD 
1965 SC 623 at 633 F,  this Court held that the words " Subject to this 
Constitution " in Article 98 (2) mean t that the jurisdiction provided for in Article 
98(2) of the 1962 Constitution could  be exe rcised except where  the Constitution 
itself created  a bar. For example, no writs could  be issued to the President, the 
Governor or in relation to proceedings in the Legislature on account of certain 
provision s in the Constitution. The words " Subject  to the  Constitution ” were  
inserted for Article 98(2) to keep it  consistent with provisions in the Constitution 
which bar jurisdiction of Courts in certain matters .” 
 
52. The words “ Subject to the Constitution ” in Articles 142 and 137 of the 
Constitution simply mean that where the Constitution itself places a bar on the C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  17 
 exercise of legislative or executive authority by the Province  such authority 
cannot be exercised in spite of its conferment by these Articles. For instance, 
while the Province  has executive authority under Article 137, this authority must 
be so exercised so as to secure compliance with federal laws, which apply in that 
Province  [Article 148(1)]. It must also be so exercised so as not to impede or 
prejudice the executive authority of the Federation [Art icle 149(1)]. Likewise, 
the legislative authority of the Province  under Article 142 of the Constitution 
can be conferred on the Federation under Article 144. Further, neither the 
executive nor the legislative authority of a Province  can be exercised in a 
manner which violates Fundamental Rights.  Any such exercise would fall foul 
of Article 8 of the Constitution.  
 
 
53. The words, “ Subject to the Constitution ” do not, therefore, make Articles 137 
or 142 subservient to the remaining provisions of the Constitution.  All that 
these mean is that where the Constitution creates a specific bar to the exercise 
of such executive or legislative authority or provides a different manner for 
such exercise then that authority must either not be exercised at all or exercised 
in such manner as the Constitution permits. It does not mean that the provision 
prefaced with such words is a subordinate constitutional provision. It also 
cannot mean that once the Province  has devolved certain powers on the Local 
Government, its legislative and executive authority is effaced by that of the 
Local Government.  The said provisions are not subordinate , but provisions, the 
exercise of authority under which , is untrammeled except where the 
Constitution itself creat es a specific and overriding bar.  
 
54. The Province  is under an obligation under Article 140A of the Constitution to 
establish, by law, a Local Government System and to devolve political, 
administrative and financial responsibility on the Local Government. Yet, in 
doing so it is not stripped ba re of its executive and legislative authority under 
Articles 137 and 142 of the Constitution.  The Provincial and the Local 
Governments are to act in a manner, which complements one another.  The 
Constitution, therefore, envisages a process of participatory democracy, where 
the two governments act in harmony with one another to develop the Province . 
The authority of neither destroys  the other. Article 140A cannot be used to 
make the provisions of Article 137 and 142 either subordinate to it or otiose. 
One con stitutional provision cannot, unless it is so specifically provided, 
override another and must be harmoniously construed together, as repeatedly 
held by this Court:  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  18

55. The creation of a Local Government System, and the co nferment upon the 
Local Government of certain political, administrative and financial 
responsibilities does not deprive the Province  of authority  over its citizens and 
deny it all role in the progress, prosperity and development of the Province . 
The creati on of a Local Government System does not spell the end of the 
Provincial Government  in the Province . To the contrary it strengthens the 
Provincial Government  by entrenching democracy at grass root level.  
 
56. That even after the insertion of Article 140A the Provincial Government  would 
continue to have the authority to enact and amend statutes, make general or 
special laws with regard to Local Government and local authorities, enlarge or 
diminish the authority of Local Government and extend or curtail municipal  
boundaries. This power of amendment has, however, to be informed by the fact 
that if the Provincial Government  oversteps its legislative or executive 
authority to make the Local Government powerless such exercise would fall 
foul of Article 140A of the Con stitution. An excessive or abusive exercise of C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  19 
 such authority would not be countenanced by this Court. It would be struck 
down.  
 
57. In India too the Constitution was amended to provide for Local Government. 
Its powers were enumerated in the Twelfth Schedule t o the Constitution. In 
respect of development of a roads project by the State Government a question 
arose whether after the constitutional amendment the State  Government any 
longer has any role in such matters. In  Society for Preservation of Environment 
& Quality of Life, Hyderabad v. State of Andhra Pradesh – AIR 1997 Andhra 
Pradesh 381 at p.386, para.5, 6 & 7  it was held that the “ matters enumerated 
in Schedule -XII thus continue to be a State subject and the State’s executive 
power being co -extensive with  subjects of legislation does not in any manner 
go out of its hands except to the extent under the laws made by the legislature . 
It is nowhere, however, seen in the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act that 
obligations for the construction, maintenance, alt eration and improvements of 
streets, bridges, sub -ways, culverts, cause -ways or the like vested in the self -
government called Municipal Corporation would denude the State Government 
of its power to create roads and necessary facilities for the City of 
Hyde rabad.” (Emphasis Supplied).  
 
58. This still leaves the question as to what is to be the scope of the political, 
administrative and financial authority to be conferred on the Local 
Governments. It is obvious that the conferment of all such authority on the 
Loca l Government would completely efface the Provincial Government  within 
a Province  and would violate Articles 137 and 142 of the Constitution . On the 
other hand , a complete failure to devolve any such authority would violate 
Article 140A of the Constitution.  It is therefore clear that some meaningful 
political, administrative and financial authority must be devolved on the Local 
Governments. The extent of such devolution has to be between nothing and 
everything. The Constitution makers could have determined t he scope of such 
devolution by enumerating Local Government powers  within the Constitution 
itself. They chose, however, not to do so.  
 
59. The omission by the Constitution makers to specifically enumerate such 
powers was deliberate. They left the scope of such  powers to be determined by 
each Province  in accordance with the prevailing circumstances and political 
realities of the day. They acknowledged that the process must be initiated, yet 
were conscious of the fact that it has to be gradual. As Local Governmen ts C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  20 
 evolve, more and more powers would have to be devolved. Room was left for 
political experimentation, constitutional dialogue and growth. Instead of 
enumerating Local Government powers the Constitution makers left these to 
be worked out in harmony betwee n the Provincial and Local Government. 
Why? Because they were conscious that political processes are evolutionary in 
nature. Institutions take root over time. They draw strength from a continuous 
constitutional dialogue between the people and their elected  representatives. 
Implicit in this was also the recognition that the imposition of a ready -made 
model from the top often proves dysfunctional. It retards rather than 
accelerate s political consensus. Much more stable is a model, which develops 
after mutual give and take over time. The progress of law, the development of 
political processes and the growth of institutions is often like the progress of a 
mountaineer: two steps forward, one step back. It may appear to be slow but 
patience is rewarded with stabil ity. 
 
60. Judges should be wary of rushing in where  Constitution make rs hesitated  to 
tread.  The line will emerge gradually with time. It will be made apparent by  a 
constant process of give and take at various levels between the two elected 
government and betwe en the elected representatives and their constituents. A 
judge made clear bright lined divider would have the advantage of certainty. At 
the same time it would suffer from the limitations of  having by -passed the 
political processes and having not been test ed in the crucible of time.  It would 
be brittle  and lack flexibility. It would freeze political debate. It would retard 
the growth of politics and the evolution of the republic. That is inevitable when 
unelected judges take over the policing of lines which  are better manned by the 
people and their elected representatives.  
 
61. The High Court has acted on the assumption that the Provincial Government  
and the Provincial Assembly have operated and will inevitably operate in a 
manner injurious to Local Government. That a nascent Local Government, 
therefore, needs protection from the Provincial Government  ogre. Such 
paternalism may no doubt provide some protection to Local Government  but at  
the same time it would also retard  the political processes  that strengthen an d 
promote stability in new  institutions. This Court would much prefer a solution 
which allows constitutional dialogue and political processes to evolve  the 
dynamics of devolution that would lead to  the development of stable and 
functionally efficient  institutions over a period of time.  
 
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  21 
 62. There is no doubt that, as correctly noted by the High Court, the amendments 
made in the LDA Act, 1975 give LDA the authority to act, to undertake 
projects and to carry out work, which under the PLGA 2013 is within the Loc al 
Government domain. The functions of the Municipal Corporations under 
Section 87 of PLGA 2013 and that of the LDA under the LDA Act 1975 
overlap.  
 
63. That Section 46 of the LDA Act, 1975 by giving overriding effect to its 
provisions is capable of being cons trued in a manner which makes it a statute 
which can override  Local Government authority under PLGA 2013. If full 
sway is to be given to the authority of LDA under the LDA Act, 1975 it may 
indeed erode Local Government authority within the Lahore Division.  The 
High Court believed it would indeed do so. It, therefore, used Article 140A as 
a criteria for constitutional validity and by invoking Fundamental Rights, 9, 14, 
17 and 25 struck down  Sections 6, 13, 13A, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 28, 34A, 
34B, 35, 3 8 and 46 of the LDA Act, 1975. (paragraph 91)  
 
64. The power to strike down or declare a legislative enactment void, however,  has 
to be exercised with a great deal of care and caution. The Courts are one of the 
three coordinate institutions of the State and ca n only perform this solemn 
obligation in the exercise of their duty to uphold the Constitution. This power 
is exercised not because the judiciary is an institution superior to the legislature 
or the executive but because it is bound by its oath to uphold, preserve and 
protect the Constitution. It must enforce t he Constitution as the Supreme L aw 
but this duty must be performed with due care and caution and only when there 
is no other alternative.  
 
65. Cooley in his “Treatise on Constitutional Limitations”, Page s 159 to 186, H.M. 
Seervai in “Constitutional Law of India”, Volume I, Pages 260 to 262, the late 
Mr. A.K. Brohi in “Fundamental Law of Pakistan”, Pages 562 to 592, Mr. 
Justice Fazal Karim in “Judicial Review of Public Actions” Volume I, Pages 
488 to 492 s tate the rules which must be applied in discharging this solemn 
duty to declare laws unconstitutional. These can be summarized as follows:  
 
I. There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a law must not 
be declared unconstitutional unless the sta tute is placed next to the 
Constitution and no way can be found in reconciling the two;  
 C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  22 
 II. Where more than one interpretation is possible, one of which would 
make the law valid and the other void, the Court must prefer the 
interpretation which favours validi ty; 
 
III. A statute must never be declared unconstitutional unless its invalidity is 
beyond reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt must be resolved in 
favour of the statute being valid;  
 
IV. If a case can be decided on other or narrower grounds, the Court will 
abstai n from deciding the constitutional question;  
 
V. The Court will not decide a larger constitutional question than is 
necessary for the determination of the case;  
 
VI. The Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional on the ground that 
it violates the spirit o f the Constitution unless it also violates the letter 
of the Constitution;  
 
VII. The Court is not concerned with the wisdom or prudence of the 
legislation but only with its constitutionality;  
 
VIII. The Court will not strike down statutes on principles of republican or 
democratic government unless those principles are placed beyond 
legislative encroachment by the Constitution;  
 
IX. Mala fides will not be attributed to the Legislature.  
 
66. These principles have been repeatedly articulated by this Court:

67. The High Court discussed Articles 9 (Right to life) and 14 (Dignity of man) in 
Paragraphs 24, 25, 91 and 96 of the judgment. However, in the judgment there 
is no discussion on how these rights are violated by the provisions of th e LDA 
Act, 1975 which have been struck down. No attempt has been made to put 
these provisions next to these Fundamental Rights and state why the two 
cannot be reconciled.  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  24 
  
68. Article 17 (Freedom of Association) is discussed in Paragraphs 85, 91 and 96 
of the  judgment. This right, it is observed would be rendered meaningless if the 
elected political party in the Local Government System is not allowed to 
function in the devolved political, administrative and financial space and the 
citizen is not permitted to p articipate in this political space. It is further 
observed in Paragraph 85 of the impugned judgment that when the devolved 
powers of the Local Government are abridged, diluted or impeded by the 
Provincial Government  it offends the constitutional provisions  of political and 
social justice besides Fundamental Rights, 9, 14, 17 and 25. There is, however, 
no discussion on why one or more of the provisions which have been struck 
down encroach upon these fundamental rights. There is also no discussion on 
why thes e fundamental rights cannot be exercised on account of these 
legislative provisions.  
 
69. Article 25 (Equality) has been invoked (paragraphs 90, 91 & 96 of the 
judgment) on the ground that the residents of Lahore are denied the right to a 
democratic process wh ile areas outside the jurisdiction of Lahore the Local 
Government has full sway.  
 
70. There is no discussion on why given the size of the population the expanse of 
the area, the nature and complexity of the problems and the needs of a mega  
city, Lahore  cannot  be dealt with and its growth and development promoted in 
a manner different from other parts of the Province . A government must not be 
compelled to follow a cookie cutter approach or else to suffer judicial 
condemnation. All difference is not discriminati on. Such a classification is not 
per se  unreasonable.  
 
71. This Court has on several occasions held that where the statute is not ex facie  
repugnant to Fundamental Rights but is capable of being so administered it 
cannot be struck down unless the party challen ging it can prove that it has been 
actually so administered:  
 
I. Federation of Pakistan v. Shaukat Ali Mian; PLD 1999 SC 1026 at 
1058 Z;  
 
II. Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan; 1991 MLD 2622 at 2638 -39 
D; C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  25 
  
III. East and West Steamship v. Pakistan;  PLD 1958 SC 4 1 at 50 B;  
 
IV. Jibendra Kishore Achharyya Chowdhry v. The Province  of East 
Pakistan; PLD 1957 SC 9 at 33 C  
 
72. This the petitioners before the High Court could not establish. And indeed the 
High Court did not so find. There was, therefore, no basis to strike dow n the 
provisions of the LDA Act, 1975.  
 
73. As the test for striking down statutes is not met the provisions of the LDA Act, 
1975 could not have been struck down by the High Court. At the same time, 
this Court is mindful of the fact that if the provisions of t he LDA Act, 1975 are 
interpreted as giving the LDA authority to overlap and override the Local 
Government  and Section 46 is given full sway , it would result in a Local 
Government that is devoid of all authority be it political, administrative or 
financial.  
 
74. The solution, therefore, lies in reading the provisions of the two statutes in 
harmony. The LDA Act, 1975 is to be regarded as an enabling statute. It allows 
LDA to act in support of and to complement the Local Government in the 
exercise of its functions  and responsibilities. Where the Local Government is 
unable to act because of a lack of resources or capacity, or where the project is 
of such a nature that it spills over from the territory of one Local Government 
to another or where the size of the Proje ct is beyond the financial capacity of 
the Local Government to execute; the LDA can step in and work with the 
Local Government. Economies of scale, spillovers and effectiveness are 
merely illustrative of the situations in which the LDA can act in the exerc ise of 
its functions to carry out developmental and other work and perform its 
statutory functions. These are not exhaustive. Life and time may throw up 
other situations and create circumstances which may warrant LDA action  to be 
taken in  consultation with  the Local Government within the p urview of PLGA, 
2013 . Closing the categories today will freeze growth and retard progress.  
 
75. Likewise the Provincial Government , in the exercise of its legislative and 
executive authority can aid and support the Local Gove rnment. The Provincial 
Government  is also not prevented from taking the initiative for the growth and 
development of the people and the Province  in the exercise of its legislative C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  26 
 and executive authority. The exercise of such authority must, however, be in  
the public interest. It should encourage institutional growth and harmony. It 
must be in consultation and with the participation of the Local Government. To 
complement is not to take over.  
 
76. We are conscious that at times a Local Government too may decline  consent 
for extraneous reasons. Where such consent is unreasonably withheld or denied 
for considerations other than in the public interest the Provincial Government  
would be at liberty to act in the public interest while constantly drawing 
guidance from t he provisions of the PLGA 2013 as for the time being in force . 
Indeed the courts too can step in and interfere with such a failure to grant 
consent.  
 
77. Viewed in this light the LDA Act, 1975 and the legislative and executive 
authority of the Province  are not  inconsistent with Article 140A of the 
Constitution. These create a framework where the Provincial and Local 
Governments and authorities of the Provincial Government  work together in 
the public interest.  
 
78. That being so what should one make of S ection 46 o f the LDA Act, 1975 
which gives its provisions overriding effect . Its use as a tool to demolish the 
PLGA would be repugnant to Article 140A. To strike it down would mean that 
even where the provisions of the LDA Act conflict with provisions of other 
statut es it would not override those. That cannot be the legislative intent. We 
are of the view that  Section 46 would apply only in the event of a conflict or 
inconsistency between its provisions and that of other statutes. It would have 
no application and canno t be used to make the LDA Act to otherwise stall 
PLGA  2013 when substantive factual or policy grounds are unavailable . When 
harmoniously construed, as stated above, there is no conflict between the 
provisions of the PLGA 2013 and the LDA Act 1975.  
 
79. The ma xim ut res magis valeat quam pereat  applies. An interpretation that 
validates outweighs one that invalidates. As observed by Cardozo J a lbeit in 
dissent in Panama Refining Company v Ryan 293 U.S. 388, 439 (1935) “ When 
a statute is reasonably susceptible of  two interpretations, by one which it is 
unconstitutional and by the other valid, the court prefers the meaning that 
preserves to the meaning that destroys ”. Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner in 
their treatise, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts  at page 66 state; 
“The presumption of validity disfavours interpretations that would nullify the C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  27 
 provision or the entire instrument ”. Section  46, therefore, need not be struck 
down. It is interpreted as being a provision which does not trump  or destroy or 
abridge any provision of the PLGA, 2013. Read thus it  does not offend Article 
140A and need not be struck down.  
 
80. It will also not be appropriate to enumerate the minimum or maximum 
political, administrative and financial powers which must be conferred upon  
the Local Government to satisfy the mandate of Article 140A of the 
Constitution. These have to be worked out by the Local and Provincial 
Government s in a constitutional dialogue over time. The contours will emerge 
and the content will be identified as the  political process continues and 
democracy takes root. It cannot be done wholesale and here and now. In this 
the Provincial Government , as the repository of all legislative and executive 
authority in the Province , must take the initiative.  It is, therefore , for the 
Provincial Government  to work constantly and tirelessly to fulfill the mandate 
of Article 140A and realize its ideals.  
 
81. Where this mandate is abdicated or exceeded the courts will step in. It would, 
however, be imprudent to provide here an exhaus tive catalogue of the dos and 
don’ts. It would freeze both the provincial and Local Governments in airtight 
compartments. The ship of state and government, like life and law, does not 
sail smoothly in watertight compartments. As observed by Holmes J in Bai n 
Peanut Co. v Pinson 282 U.S. 499, 501 (1931): “ we must remember that the 
machinery of Government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in 
its joints ”. Or as he wrote in his book The Common Law at page 1:“ The law 
embodies the story of a nati on’s development through many centuries and it 
cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a 
book of mathematics … Life is painting a picture; not doing a sum ”. It would 
also tie down the judges in future to this catalogue wh ich in the facts of the 
case before them may prove to be non -exhaustive or inaccurate. Like Stewart J 
in Jacobellis v Ohio 378 U.S 184, 197 (1964)  I too “ shall not today attempt 
further to define the kind of materials I understand to be embraced within tha t 
short -hand description and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing 
so. But I know it when I see it… ” It is best in such situations to move forward 
with caution  so that our judgments prove to be stepping stones towards a 
democratic future and not fetter us to the past.  
 
82. The High Court has also ignored a number of realities of the day. Elections to 
Local Government in the Province  have not taken place as yet. There is no C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  28 
 conflict at the moment between Local and Provincial authorities. 
Developme ntal work, even if it fell within the domain of the Local 
Government, could not have been abandoned and all projects brought to a 
standstill simply because the Local Government did not exist.  Even if these 
functions could be assumed to be within the exclus ive domain of the Local 
Government and could only be exercised by it to the exclusion of everyone 
else, even then, given the reality of the day, the Provincial Government  could 
not be taken to task for carrying out development work.  
 
83. There was, and at the moment is, a political vacuum due to the absence of 
elected Local Government. The High Court itself acknowledged that this was 
so and allowed the LDA to continue with day to day repair and maintenance 
work and complete all pending projects  (paragraph 100).  The High Court also 
acknowledged that the Project too was pending and “ was stopped through an 
interim order ” (paragraph 100 A). Yet, the High Court ruled that the Project 
had, “not commenced” (paragraph 100) and, therefore, struck it down as 
unconstitutio nal. No reasons were given for treating this Project differently 
from all other pending projects. Further, the Court gave no reason why there 
being a vacuum, LDA and/or Provincial Government  could not carry out 
development works. It is settled law that the  law abhors a vacuum:  
 
 
I. Ghazala Tariq v. Federation of Pakistan; 2005 PLC (CS) 271 at 273 A  
 
II. Mumbar and another v. Ijaz  Hussain and others; 2007 SCMR 533 at 
536 A  
 
III. Air League of PIAC Employees v. Federation of Pakistan; 2011 SCMR 
1254 at 1279 Q  
 
IV. Sarfraz  Saleem v. Federation of Pakistan and others; PLD 2014 SC 232 
at 235 B & C  
 
It was, therefore, not at all necessary to either strike down laws or interfere 
with the Project.  
 
84. Although counsel for both sides submitted that the real issue in the case was 
const itutional and the discussion on the process followed by the regulator was C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  29 
 perhaps unnecessary ; yet they at the same time spent considerable time on the 
issue. We, therefore, feel it necessary to discuss this aspect of the case too 
albeit briefly.  
 
85. Even Mr.  Salman Akram Raja ASC disassociated himself from the findings of 
the High Court on regulatory capture. Indeed he was right in doing so. The  
doctrine applies where a  statutory body set up to regulate a group is then 
manned by the persons from that group to  defeat regulation. It would not apply 
where the regulated includes the government because inevitably appointments 
to such regulatory bodies have to be made by the government. That does not 
mean that the government can defeat the legislative intent by not appointing 
persons to such bodies or by making appointments of such persons who will 
act but only under its dictation. The power to appoint has to be exercised in a 
fair manner and the exercise of authority by the appointee has to be 
transparent, in the pu blic interest and non arbitrary.  
 
86. The government does not have an absolute discretion in the matter. For as 
Douglas J wrote in New York v U.S 342 U.S. 882, 884, “ Absolute discretion 
like corruption marks the beginning of the end of liberty ”. Even where 
legislative bodies confer discretion on regulators without meaningful standards 
it is the duty of those on whom such discretion has been conferred to structure 
it. They must develop standards to regulate it. They should confine their 
discretion through princ iples and rules. This has been the consistent view of 
this Court : Chairman RTA v. Pak Mutual Insurance Co. PLD 1991 SC 14 at 
26. 
 
87. This was clearly not done  in the present case . Further, Section 5(6) of the 
Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997 imposed a mandatory duty on the 
Provincial Government  to constitute Advisory Comm ittees under the said Act. 
This Comm ittee is meant to assist the Environmental Protection Agency in 
evaluating the en vironmental impact of projects under consideration. The 
failure by the Provincial Government  to constitute the said Committee  violated 
its statutory duty. 
 
88. In spite of the fact that we were not inclined to strike down the statutory 
provisions and our reading of the Constitution is very different from that of 
the High Cour t we hesitated before taking a different view from the High 
Court on these aspects of the case. We would have struck down the EIA for 
these reasons but eventually decided against it.  C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  30 
  
89. We decided so because in our view as per entry at Serial N o.2 of Part -D of 
Schedule -II of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Review of IEE 
& EIA ) Regulations , 2000 projects for rebuilding or reconstruction of existing 
roads do not require an EIA. The m eaning of rebuild includes “ to make 
important improvements or cha nges in ”. Meaning of reconstruct includes “ to 
remodel and/or to make changes so as to make it work more effectively ”. The 
Project, therefore, did not require EIA approval.  
90. Further and more important is the fact  that the impugned judgment h as not 
recorded  any objection to the EIA on its merits, nor have the respondents 
highlighted any objection that has remained unattended and  yet is fatal to the 
EIA. Moreover, the statute provides an appeal to an Environmental Tribunal 
presided over by a retired judge of th e High Court and a second appeal to a 
Division Bench of the High Court itself.  Neither of these remedies have been 
availed by the objecting respondents. We cannot strike down the EIA upon a 
mere presumption or apprehension. 
 
91. This should not, however, be co nstrued as an endorsement of the failure by the 
Punjab Government to constitute Advisory Committees under PEPA. The 
failure to do so immediately would be a violation of a statutory duty and 
provide grounds for striking down an EIA. Such committees must be 
constituted immediately and in any event no later than 45 days. Further, in the 
exercise of its authority the EPA has to act in a fair, non -arbitrary and non -
discriminatory manner. It must not act under the dictation of the Punjab 
Government. It must act f airly and free from governmental influence. It must 
also record cogent reasons for both granting and refusing an EIA. The duty to 
record reasons is mandatory. Where no reasons are recorded the courts would 
be justified in concluding that no good reasons ex ist. That would render the 
administrative or regulatory order void.  
 
92. We now turn to one peripheral and one consequential matter. While accepting 
the writ petitions the learned judges of the High Court made a number of 
disparaging remarks about a learned se nior counsel. Such remarks undoubtedly 
cause reputational damage. The temptation to go down this road must be 
avoided except in the rarest of rare cases. And even then the reasons for 
making such remarks must be carefully and clearly stated. In this case t he 
remarks have been made without a word of explanation about what occasioned 
these. All the learned counsel for the respondent s chose not to defend the C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  31 
 remark at all. We direct that these remarks contained in paragraph 10, 21 & 22 
of the judgment be expun ged. 
 
 
93. Having dealt with the peripheral now to the consequential matter. As we are 
partly allowing these appeals, allowing the Project to be completed and 
upholding the EIA , the directions issued in paragraph 100A of the judgment 
against various officials have to be vacated.  
 
 
94. These are the reasons for partly allowing these appeals by our short order. The 
short order reproduced below is to be read with these detailed reasons:  
 
 
(i)       Elected Local Governments are presently not in 
existence in the Province  of Punjab. The Provincial 
Government  through its agencies is performing their 
duties and functions . The disputed Signal Free 
Corridor Project was conceived by an agency  of the 
Provincial Government , LDA, in the year 2014  and 
included in its budget allocation for 2014 -15. 
Construction of the project was awarded to the 
Contractor on 19.02.2015, who had a lready undertaken 
construction in the value of Rs.60 million before the 
interim restraint order was issued by the learned High 
Court on 06.03.2015. In the vacuum resulting from the 
absence of an e lected L ahore Metropolitan 
Corporation, the initiation, app roval and e xecution of 
the disputed Signal Free Corridor project by the 
Provincial Government  through its agency, LDA, is 
held to be valid. The said project may accordingly be 
completed subject to provision of additional facilities 
for pedestrians, inter alia, including road crossing and  
passes at intervals of one-kilometre or less along the 
project road distance. 
 
 
(ii)       Subject, inter alia, to the criteria of spill over, 
economies of scale, effectiveness as shall be 
determined in the detailed reasons by the Court, any C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  32 
 new project falling within the domain of Lahore 
Metropolitan Corporation for approval or execution 
shall not be undertaken by the Provincial Gover nment  
or its agency without prior consultation and consent, 
unless withheld without justified reasons, as the case 
may be, of the elected  Lahore  Metropolitan  
Corporation in respect of such project. 
 
 
(iii) Article 140A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan casts a mandatory obligation on the Province s 
to establish Local Governments possessing meaningful 
authority and  responsibility in the p olitical arena, 
administrative and financial matters. It is the duty of a 
Province  through the Provincial Gover nment  and  the 
Provincial Assembly to purposefully empower Local 
Governments in the Province  so as to comply with their 
mandatory obligation under Article 140A of the 
Constitution. 
 
 
(iv) In the present case, the powers in relation to master 
plan and  spatial planning historically belonging to 
Lahore Metropolitan Corporation ha ve been 
superimposed with similar functions vesting in LDA 
under Provincial law. To the extent of conflict in the 
exercise of their respective powers and functions by the 
two bodies or on account of legal provisions having 
overriding effect, Article 140A  of the Constitution 
confers   p rimacy upon the a uthority vesting in an 
elected Local Government over the powers conferred 
by law o n t he Pr o vinc ia l Go ver nme nt  or an 
agency thereof. Notwithstanding the above, the 
Provincial Government  is in any case under a duty to 
establish harmonious working relationship with an 
elected Local Government wherein respect is accorded 
to the views and decisions of the latter. Accordingly, 
Section 46 of the Lahore Development A uthority Act, 
1975,  purporting to override conflicting action taken by 
an elected Local Government, is held to be against  the 
scheme  of the Constitution  and should either be read C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  33 
 down or declared ultra vires as determined in the 
detailed judgment. 
 
 
(v)      Section 5(6) of the Punjab Environmental Protection 
Act, 1997  imposes a mandatory duty on the Provincial 
Government  to constitute Advisory Comm ittee under 
the said Act. This Comm ittee is meant to assist the 
Environmental Protection Agency in evaluating the 
environmental impact of projects under consideration. 
The failure by the Provincial Government  to constitute 
the said Committee  violates its statutory duty. However, 
in the p resent case the impugned judgment h as not 
attended any objection to the EIA on its merits, nor 
have the respondents highlighted any objection  that 
has remained unattended  and yet is fatal to the EIA. 
Moreover, the right of appeal and  further remedies on 
the merits of the EIA app roval available under the 
Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997,  have not 
been availed by the objecting respondents. The EIA 
cannot be struck down upon presumption or mere 
apprehen sion. 
 
 
(vi) It is improper that disparaging references are made in 
the impugned judgment to a learned senior counsel, 
who had objected to the composition of the Bench. 
Contents of paragraphs 10(d), 21 & 22 in the impugned 
judgment containing such remarks  are accordingly  
expunged . Equally, the academic expositions on the 
concepts of subsidiarity and federalism within the 
federating units, in the present case a Province , cannot 
be made grounds by the impugned judgment for 
striking down statutory law. The only touchstone for 
this purpose is conflict of statutory law with the 
provisions of the Constitution. Consequently, the said 
grounds adopted by the impugned judgment are 
rejected. 
 
 
(vii) The action proposed in the impugned judgment to be 
taken against the officials of the LDA or any other C.A. NO.545 TO 550 OF 2015  34 
 person as en visaged by paragraph 100A  thereof is also 
set aside.
