Subject:   VERIFICATION OF ‘ O’ & ‘A’ LEVEL 
IN RESPECT OF MS. MAIZA HAMID  
 
  I am directed to refer to your letter No.5 -
3/HEC/A&A/2013 dated April 4, 2013 on the above 
noted subject and to inform that the candidate have 
passed GCE ‘O’ level in seven subjects namely Biology,

2.  Mst. Maiza Hameed filed a Civil Misc. Application 
bearing No.4580 of 201 3, wherein it was, inter alia , contended that 
Mst. Maiza Hameed had suc cessfully passed her “O” Level 
Examination  in seven subjects  whereafter she took her “A” Level 
Examination and on the basis of her “O” and “A” Level , she applied 
for enrollment in the Islamia University, Bahawalpur (the 
University) , for B.A. It is further contended that on the basis of the 
testimonial s supplied by Mst. Maiza Hameed, the University 
admitted her to the course whereafter she successfully took the 
examination and obtained B. A. Degree.   CMA.3470/13 in CMA.1536/13 . 4 
3.  In the above perspective, it is contended by Mr. Wasim 
Sajjad, learned  Sr. ASC that the testimonials and documents 
perta ining to the “O” and “A” Level E xamination s have not been 
held to be forged or fabricated. She made a full disclosure of  her 
educational qualification s when she applied for admission in B.A. in 
the University. On the basis of said documents , she was granted 
admission and took the examination and that the Degree issued by 
the University is genuine and has also not been dis owned by the 
University. If any  error was made by the University for which she 
cannot be held liable nor any dishonesty or adopting of unfair 
means can be attributed to her, therefore, it is contended that she 
cannot be held not to possess the qualifications  to a Member of the 
Provincial Assembly or the Parli ament , as prescribed by Article 
62(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 . 
4.  While it is the case of the opposite side that Mst. Maiza 
Hameed did not possess the requisite q ualificat ions to participate in 
the B.A. E xamination as she had not passed the required subjects  in 
her “O” and “A” Levels , as prescribed by the IBCC in this behalf. 
Hence, her B.A. Degree was invalid and she had made a mis -
declaration regarding her educat ional qualifications while contesting 
the General Elections of 2008.   CMA.3470/13 in CMA.1536/13 . 5 
5.  During the course of arguments , it has come to light that 
to-date the genuineness of the “O” and “A” Level testimonials of 
Mst. Maiza Hameed has not been verified . Thus, without prej udice 
to the rival contentions raised by the parties noted herein above , in 
order to do complete justice , it would be appropriate that such an 
exercise be conducted by the HEC and thereafter  this Court shall 
proceed further in the matter , if need be .
